"ship anti-grounding with a maritime autonomous surface ship and digital twin of port of hamburg","2023","We present the virtual demonstration of a novel ship Anti-Grounding Service in a digital twinned use case scenario in the Port of Hamburg. The scenario is generated from real bathymetry survey data collected in the Port. The virtual model of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship travels the route ahead of merchant ships on approach to the Port and is integrated with a real-time high-resolution Multibeam SONAR Simulator that synthesizes underkeel survey data. The automated data processing workflow detects potential grounding hazards in the synthetic survey data and provides a real-time update of the Port nautical chart, which is presented in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System of a Ship Handling Simulator. Our method is the first to consider Multibeam SONAR equipped Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship platforms for provision of ship Anti-Grounding Services. The results validate the full-scale simulation and automated hazard detection workflow and incorporate tests conducted with certified mariners (N=10) to address human factors of introducing new technologies into safety critical situations. The key contributions of this work are summarized as: 1) Validation of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships as an Anti-Grounding Service delivery platform; 2) Demonstration of a Digital Twin for hydrography survey and bottom hazard detection; and 3) Experimental validation with certified mariners of the anti-grounding service Human-Computer Interface on the ship bridge.","digital twinned use case scenario,automated data processing workflow,ship antigrounding service,underkeel survey data,electronic chart display,Bridges,human factors,bathymetry survey data,safety,grounding hazards,antigrounding service delivery platform,hydrography,Surveys,digital twins,ships,marine safety,maritime autonomous surface ship platforms,autonomous,port nautical chart,synthetic survey data,Seaports,object detection,automated hazard detection workflow,simulation,digital twin,ship handling simulator,sonar,unmanned vehicle,Autonomous aerial vehicles,bathymetry,Real-time systems,antigrounding service human-computer interface,real-time high-resolution multibeam SONAR simulator,merchant ship,Hazards,hazards,Hamburg port,SONAR,ports,navigation,Digital twins,merchant ships,oceanographic techniques,ship bridge,"
"satellite-derived bathymetry for maritime archaeology: testing its effectiveness at two ancient harbours in the eastern mediterranean","2021","High-resolution bathymetry is an essential tool in maritime archaeology, often used for underwater prospection, imaging, palaeo-landscape reconstruction and change detection. The commonest acquisition method relies on shipborne acoustic systems (e.g. multibeam echosounder). However, most of the world’s seabed has not been surveyed using these methods. Derivation of bathymetry from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry: SDB) can redress this in shallow (<20–30 m depth) clear water. It can be derived empirically using depth control points, or independent of control data through physics-based approaches. Given global satellite coverage, it is applicable almost anywhere with suitable water conditions and is becoming increasingly widespread in the hydrographic survey community. However, archaeological application of SDB is almost totally un-investigated. This paper examines the utility of SDB for maritime archaeology through 2 case studies: the ancient harbours of Tyre (Lebanon) and Ras Ibn Hani (Syria). Tested data comprise 2 m-resolution physics-based commercial SDB and medium-resolution (10–30 m) SDB empirically derived from open access multispectral imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). SDB was assessed for its ability to detect submerged cultural features and landforms and as input into palaeo-geographic reconstructions. Tested SDB performed poorly for feature detection, but was better-suited to landform identification and palaeo-geographic reconstruction. SDB also has clear advantages: low cost, wide area coverage, speed and data availability. Disadvantages include variable accuracy, technical limitations (e.g. need for clear water) and approach-specific requirements (e.g. depth control points for empirical and complex modelling for physics-based approaches). For maritime archaeology, its current limitations means that it will not replace acoustics for prospection and imaging but it does have utility for submerged landscape investigation and reconstruction, particularly in areas which now only have no/poor bathymetric data.","Bathymetry,SDB,Submerged landscapes,Geoarchaeology,Shipwrecks,Satellite imagery,"
"contaminants in two west greenland caribou populations","2016","Two caribou populations in West Greenland were sampled and the kidneys, liver and muscle analyzed for contaminants, including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc. Although close in proximity, the two populations are topographically separated by an ice cap, which creates different climates and vegetation types in each region. Contaminant levels reflected the differing diets of the two caribou populations. To the south in the wetter lichen-rich region, caribou had significantly more aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc, likely due to atmospheric deposition on lichens. To the north in the dry desert steppe where grasses predominate, caribou had higher levels of copper. Cows collected in late winter had significantly less hepatic copper, lead and mercury if pregnant, indicating placental transfer of these elements. Our results suggest that hepatic copper levels <200μgg−1 dry weight may result in copper depletion in pregnant cows and hepatic mercury concentrations above 0.5μgg−1 dry weight may negatively affect fertility in caribou cows. Hepatic mercury levels were negatively correlated with cow body weight, suggesting an adverse effect on body condition. Element concentrations found in tissues from these caribou are not considered to be of a health concern for those consuming this traditional food.","Copper,Lead,Selenium,Mercury,Cadmium,Caribou,"
"upper mississippi pb as a mid-1800s chronostratigraphic marker in sediments from seasonally anoxic lakes in eastern canada","2013","Sediment cores from eight headwater lakes located in Southern Québec, Eastern Canada, were analyzed for Pb, stable Pb isotopes, and the radioelements 210Pb, 137Cs, 241Am and 226Ra. The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century 210Pb-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000km from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate 210Pb chronologies in environmental archives from Eastern North America.",""
"assessment of marine litter through remote sensing: recent approaches and future goals","2021","This bibliographic review provides an overview of techniques used to detect marine litter using remote sensing. The review classified studies in terms of platform (satellite, aircrafts, drones), sensors (passive or active), spectral (visible, infrared, microwaves), spatial resolution (<1 to >30 m), type and size (macroplastics, microplastics), or classification methodology (sighting, photointerpretation, supervised). Most studies applied satellite information to address marine litter using multi- and hyper- spectral optical sensors. The correspondence analysis on analyzed variables exhibited that aircrafts with high spatial resolution (<3 m) with optical sensors (λ = 400 to 2500 nm) seem to be the most optimum combination to target marine litter, while satellites carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors (λ = 3.1 to 5.6 cm) may detect sea-slicks associated to surfactants that might contain high concentration of microplastics. Gaps indicate that future goals in marine litter detection should be addressed with platforms including optical and SAR sensors.","SAR,Remote sensing,Sea-slicks,Marine plastic litter,Optical sensors,"
"role of rainfall intensity and urban sprawl in the 2014 flash flood in genoa city, bisagno catchment (liguria, italy)","2018","Flash floods are typical for the Mediterranean region, however they have been recurring at increasing frequency over the past few decades especially over the Italian Peninsula. The region of Genoa has recently moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous flash floods of the Bisagno River and its tributaries as a result of intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011 and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects of the Bisagno River flash flood of October 9th, 2014 in the city of Genoa. Application of a Standard Anomaly Index and a Cluster Analysis reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded in the Bisagno Valley for the period of 1945–2016. Urban sprawl in the catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding Genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land use change, including in particular transformations of the Bisagno riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen observatory for early warning of flash floods.","Urban sprawl,Italy,Flash flood risk,Rainfall regime variations,Mediterranean area,Genoa,"
"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper. In order to complete the online real-time detection of ship abnormal behavior with multivariate and multidimensional time series, improve the accuracy of ship abnormal behavior detection and reduce the blind area of VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) system monitoring.","ship abnormal behavior monitoring,VTS system,sea environment set,graph attention network,multivariate time series,graph neural network,Marine vehicles,neural nets,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,VTS system monitoring,multidimensional time series,sliding window,Data models,object detection,vessel traffic service,Time series analysis,existing maritime intelligent supervision,online real-time detection,Real-time systems,graph theory,time series,ship abnormal behavior detection method,Trajectory,maritime supervision,fixed data input generation,Cognition,traffic engineering computing,ship abnormal behavior detection,abnormal behavior characteristics,ship behavior characteristics,"
"a ten-year analysis of cloud-to-ground lightning activity over the eastern mediterranean region","2015","Lightning activity is analysed in a sector covering the Eastern Mediterranean (16–32°E, 34–46°N) for the years 2005–2014. The study is based on the use of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity data retrieved from ZEUS system, operated by the National Observatory of Athens, and examines the seasonal, diurnal and spatial variability of the lightning activity. The effect of elevation, terrain slope, vegetation cover and convective available potential energy (CAPE) on the distribution of the CG lightning strokes is also investigated. Lightning is modulated by the diurnal cycle of insolation and the underlying topographic features of the region. The lightning strokes are more numerous over the mainland than over the sea. CG lightning activity is dominant over the land and the coastal areas during spring and summer while during the coldest period of the year it is dominant over the sea. The maximum value of lightning activity is observed in June and mostly in the afternoon. The orography and the terrain slope affect the distribution of lightning. During the warmest period of the year, the forested areas have an increased “lightning yield”. The number of CG lightning strokes increases with increasing CAPE and the high correlation between them indicates that CAPE values could be used as a proxy for the presence of lightning activity, at least over the eastern Mediterranean region.","Vegetation cover,Topographic features,Lightning climatology,Eastern Mediterranean,CAPE,"
"intelligent permaculture: a sustainable and profitable practice for tropical and maritime climate urban and peri-urban agricultural ecosystems","2021","Permaculture is a land management and regenerative agriculture that is the integration of technological advancement and the natural agricultural ecosystems. It is usually manifested in green architecture and balcony gardens in an urban area. However, peri-urban geographical regions are those situated in between urban and rural areas that are experiencing the impacts of modernizing community and conventional farming. This study discusses the technological drivers making intelligent permaculture ecosystems and applications, the current issues and challenges in this emerging agricultural and horticultural scheme, and a set of future directives in intelligent permaculture ecosystems in a tropical and maritime climatic setting.

"assessment of the resilience of a complex network for crude oil transportation on the maritime silk road","2020","As one of the most strategically important natural resources, crude oil can be dangerous to transport by sea. The resilience of a maritime transport network denotes the ability of the system to withstand damage and remain operational after disturbances, representing the invulnerability of the network and its ability to recover from harm. In this study, we built a crude oil transportation network titled the Maritime Silk Road using Automatic Identification System (AIS) sensor data, designed a resilience assessment framework based on complex network theory, and assessed the resilience of the maritime crude oil transportation network from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives with the help of complex network metrics and a resilience model. The results show that the topology of the crude oil transportation network has a significant impact on its resilience, in that network density and centrality are negatively related to network resilience, whereas network connectivity and size are positively related to resilience. Subsequently, the resilience of crude oil transportation networks declines at a steady rate under random attacks but declines sharply under intentional attacks. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of invulnerability and recovery in the context of resilience concludes that strengthening small and medium-sized ports in the network is important to enhance network resilience. These results can provide reference and decision support for port planning, route design, optimization, and form a foundation for a more secure and reliable maritime transportation network system.","resilience assessment framework,Safety,maritime transport network,crude oil transportation network,complex network metrics,goods distribution,network resilience,Resilience,Maritime Silk Road,complex network theory,reliable maritime transportation network system,complex network,Oils,network connectivity,secure maritime transportation network system,network theory (graphs),Complex networks,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,crude oil,network density,Roads,maritime crude oil transportation network,mathematical analysis,petroleum industry,complex networks,AIS data,maritime silk road,"
"cyber risk perception in the maritime domain: a systematic literature review","2021","This paper aims to present an approach to investigate cyber risk perception with use of recognized psychological models, and to give an overview of state-of-the-art research within the field of cyber risk perception in general and in the context of the maritime domain. The focus will be on determinative dimensions within the psychometric paradigm and cognitive biases, and to give recommendations on further research within these fields. Okoli and Schabramâ€™s eight-step guide to plan, select, extract, and execute a systematic literature review is used as guidance. The search process resulted in 25 relevant articles which describes 24 dimensions of cyber risk perception in different online environments. Research within the area of maritime cyber security is increasing, however, no studies relevant for our literature review were found within the maritime domain. The nine dimensions in the psychometric model, perceived benefit and the optimistic bias is presented and discussed in a maritime context. Cyber risk perception is a complex research-area where both determinative factors and other cognitive processes can be influenced by each other. This can indicate that the dimensions differ across populations and professions, creating grounds for why context-specific studies are important. Further research may benefit from more multidisciplinary, descriptive, and inductive approaches, and contextual studies within maritime cyber risk perception can contribute to develop targeted tools for risk mitigation to enhance safety at sea.","risk perception,Safety,online environments,systematic literature review,maritime cyber risk perception,human behavior,security of data,human factors,psychology,Cyberspace,cognition,search process,Bibliographies,marine safety,psychological models,marine engineering,cognitive biases,project management,Computer crime,cognitive processes,maritime cyber security,cyberpsychology,risk analysis,Psychology,psychometric paradigm,Maritime cyber security,Tools,risk communication,Systematics,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"
"maritime containers tracking trial results","2009","There are approximately 7 million maritime-style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the US. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","maritime containers tracking,US,Inspection,Canada,VHF antennas,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,metal enclosure,Containers,Globalization,frequency spectrum,containers,market globalization,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Road transportation,container tracking technologies,VHP antenna,Power generation economics,Security,"

"an effective presentation of navigation information for prevention of maritime disaster using ais and 3d-gis","2013","We present a method for communicating navigation information that will assist operators to prevent maritime disaster. Although this topic has been extensively researched, the navigational situation of vessels has received little attention. However, such a navigational situation is essential for understanding water bodies and ensuring maritime safety. To provide effective navigation information, this study first analyzes the actual situation of vessel traffic using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Operators can be based on the analysis to understand the trend of navigation ships in water bodies as an important reference. From the results of the analysis, we constructed a representable navigational information system. Different information was unified on a Geographical Information System (GIS) in two-and three-dimensional formats. The system was demonstrated in a navigation simulation of a real voyage ship in Osaka Bay, Japan. The integrated information can be comprehensively and realistically interpreted by operators. Therefore, the system is expected to effectively avoid maritime disaster.","marine accidents,voyage ship,3D GIS,Maritime traffic,Safety,navigation information presentation,Marine vehicles,marine navigation,data visualisation,effective navigation information,Automatic Identification System data,vessel traffic,Japan,Voyage simulation,maritime disaster prevention,marine safety,Oceans,Educational institutions,Maritime disaster,geographic information systems,3D-GIS data,Osaka Bay,Navigation,Information systems,navigation information communication,marine control,Geographic information systems,AIS data,Geographical Information System,maritime safety,"

Big data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, buoys, vessels, and satellites could potentially fuel a large number of interesting applications for environmental protection, security, fault prediction, shipping routes optimization, and energy production. However, because of several challenges related to big data and the high heterogeneity of the data sources, such applications are still underdeveloped and fragmented. In this paper, we analyze challenges and requirements related to big maritime data applications and propose a scalable data management solution.

"spatial ontologies for detecting abnormal maritime behaviour","2012","The upsurge in piracy and the impact of recent environmental disasters have highlighted the need to improve maritime surveillance. Governmental and private initiatives have developed monitoring systems with improved acquisition and analysis capabilities. These systems rely on one major component, namely the detection of abnormal ship behaviour. This implies a detailed formalisation of expert knowledge. However, the quantity of data, the complexity of situations, the failure to take into account their spatial characteristics and the potential for the same scenario to be interpreted in different ways have proved to be significant problems. We therefore propose a new prototype for the analysis of abnormal ship behaviour. The system is based on a spatial ontology associated with a geographical inference engine.

"a safety barrier-based accident model for offshore drilling blowouts","2013","Blowout is one of the most serious accidents in the offshore oil and gas industry. Accident records show that most of the offshore blowouts have occurred in the drilling phase. Efficient measures to prevent, mitigate, and control offshore drilling blowouts are important for the entire offshore oil and gas industry. This article proposes a new barrier-based accident model for drilling blowouts. The model is based on the three-level well control theory, and primary and secondary well control barriers and an extra well monitoring barrier are established between the reservoir and the blowout event. The three barriers are illustrated in a graphical model that is similar to the well-known Swiss cheese model. Five additional barriers are established to mitigate and control the blowout accident, and event tree analysis is used to analyze the possible consequence chains. Based on statistical data and literature reviews, failures of each barrier are presented. These failures can be used as guidance for offshore drilling operators to become aware of the vulnerabilities of the safety barrier system, and to assess the risk related to these barriers. The Macondo accident is used as a case study to show how the new model can be used to understand the development of the events leading to the accident. The model can also be used as an aid to prevent future blowouts or to stop the escalation of events.","Accident model,Offshore drilling,Active failures,Safety barrier,Blowout,"
"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements.

Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at sea, risk assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators.

"combining multiple correspondence analysis with factorial kriging analysis for geochemical mapping of the gold–silver deposit at marrancos (portugal)","2004","This study concerns the application of multiple correspondence analysis and factorial kriging analysis to soil data, and aims to identify spatial patterns and superficial soil anomalies of the Au and Ag deposit at Marrancos, Vila Verde. The mineral deposit can be described as a quartz auriferous shear-zone, consisting of a quartz breccia of tectonic origin hosted by metamorphic rocks (hornfels). Gold is associated with arsenopyrite and pyrite, and Ag with galena and galenobismuthite. A total of 286 soil samples were analysed for Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, Mn, Ag and Bi by atomic absorption spectrometry, As, Se, Te and Sb by atomic absorption spectrometry–hydride generation system and Au by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy after extraction of the metal by an organic solvent (methyl-isobutylketone). The methodology used included (a) multiple correspondence analysis applied to soil data to obtain some factors that summarize geochemical information, (b) a structural analysis (variography) in order to account for spatial variability of these factors, and (c) factorial kriging analysis used to split these factors into their spatial components.

"diapycnal diffusivity in the core and oxycline of the tropical north atlantic oxygen minimum zone","2016","Diapycnal diffusivity estimates from two Tracer Release Experiments (TREs) and microstructure measurements in the oxycline and core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) are compared. For the first time, two TREs within the same area at different depths were realized: the Guinea Upwelling Tracer Release Experiment (GUTRE) initiated in 2008 in the oxycline at approximately 320m depth, and the Oxygen Supply Tracer Release Experiment (OSTRE) initiated in 2012 in the core of the OMZ at approximately 410m depth. The mean diapycnal diffusivity Dz was found to be insignificantly smaller in the OMZ core with (1.06±0.24)×10−5m2s−1 compared to (1.11±0.22)×10−5m2s−1 90m shallower in the oxycline. Unexpectedly, GUTRE tracer was detected during two of the OSTRE surveys which showed that the estimated diapycnal diffusivity from GUTRE over a time period of seven years was within the uncertainty of the previous estimates over a time period of three years. The results are consistent with the Dz estimates from microstructure measurements and demonstrate that Dz does not vary significantly vertically in the OMZ within the depth range of 200–600m and does not change with time. The presence of a seamount chain in the vicinity of the GUTRE injection region did not cause enhanced Dz compared to the smoother bottom topography of the OSTRE injection region, although the analysis of vertical shear spectra from ship ADCP data showed elevated internal wave energy level in the seamount vicinity. However, the two tracer patches covered increasingly overlapping areas with time and thus spatially integrated increasingly similar fields of local diffusivity, as well as the difference in local stratification counteracted the influence of roughness on Dz. For both experiments no significant vertical displacements of the tracer were observed, thus diapycnal upwelling within the ETNA OMZ is below the uncertainty level of 5myr−1.","Tropical Atlantic,Guinea Dome,Tracers,Diffusion coefficients,Upwelling,Oxygen minimum zone,Ventilation,"

"graph-based ship traffic partitioning for intelligent maritime surveillance in complex port waters","2023","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.","Graph partitioning,Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Maritime knowledge extraction,AIS data,"
"an integrated dynamic ship risk model based on bayesian networks and evidential reasoning","2021","The paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the risk of ships based on a hybrid approach and multiple data sources. A Bayes-based network learning approach uses data from the New Inspection Regime of the Paris MoU on Port State Control to characterise the relationships among risk parameters and uses these parameters to evaluate the ship static risk. Other data sources are used to develop a Bayesian Network model to assess the dynamic risk of the ship. The data is aggregated by Bayesian Network and Evidential Reasoning approaches to evaluate the overall risk of ships in coastal waters. The objective of the study is to develop a model to assess the risk of an individual ship by considering its static risk profile and the geographical-dependant risk factors related to the characteristics of the maritime traffic flow and other local characteristics that influence the navigational risk of the ship. The results show that the integrated approach is able to assess the overall risk of a ship based on multiple data sources, providing empirical evidence of using multiple data sources in risk analysis applications. Moreover, the developed model identifies the most critical circumstances and the key impact factors in the study waters, which can support decisions on risk prevention and mitigation measures and local maritime traffic management.","Evidential Reasoning,Rule-based approach,Static and dynamic ship risk,Bayesian Networks,Automatic identification system data,Port State Control inspection data,Maritime risk analysis,"
"climatic variability in humid africa along the gulf of guinea part i: detailed analysis of the phenomenon in côte d'ivoire","1997","The analysis presented here deals with annual precipitation as well as the number of rainy days observed in Côte d'Ivoire during the decades from 1950 to 1980. The study is based on a set of methods both for interpolation and for cartographic representation as well as on statistical methods for the detection of breaks in the time series. The methods reveal a climatic variability in the country as a whole at the end of the 60s and at the beginning of the 70s. Indeed, the results show that there was a sharp decrease both in rainfall amounts and in the number of rainy days during the 60s and the 70s. Côte d'Ivoire, which belongs to humid Africa, was therefore affected by a climatic accident comparable to and in line with what was observed further north in the Sahelian region.",""
"analysis of the radar coverage provided by a maritime radar network of co-operative vessels based on real ais data","2013","We present the analysis of the radar coverage capability provided by a Radar Network of Cooperative Vessels (RNCV) that exploits ship-borne radars and AIS (Automatic Identification System) channel to share radar plots in a dense maritime traffic area.

The cloud of AIS data is pre-processed by the NATO's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) in order to extract recurrent vessel's routes and to define harbors, offshore platforms, entry and exit points.

"coastal engineering applications of high-resolution lidar bathymetry","1998","In 1994, the US Army Corps of Engineers completed development of the Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey (SHOALS) system, a state-of-the-art hydrographic survey instrument. Using lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology and operating from a Bell 212 helicopter, SHOALS remotely collects accurate, high-resolution bathymetry at a rate of 8 km2/h. A nominal depth-and-position measurement spacing of 4 m yields high-density bottom coverage of coastal projects, producing soundings from the above-water beach, or coastal structure, to depths of 40 m. Since becoming fully operational, SHOALS surveyed over 2000 km2 along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, and Caribbean Sea. Survey projects varied from tidal inlets and navigation channels to beach nourishment and monitoring. These projects quantify current coastal structure condition, navigation channel alignments, and morphologic changes over time. In addition to monitoring coastal projects, sediment transport can be estimated with accurate, high-resolution bathymetry. Bathymetry can be translated into sediment transport through a combination of the sediment continuity equation, a surf zone energetics-based longshore transport formula, and bathymetric data. This paper presents the SHOALS system describing both lidar technology and the survey system. Several SHOALS data sets are presented to show today's benefits of high-resolution lidar bathymetry to the coastal engineering community. Finally, ongoing research using these unique data sets is presented to show the future benefits of lidar bathymetry to the coastal field.","Bathymetry,Sediment transport,Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey system,"
"long-range dependence in north atlantic sea level","2006","Sea level is an important parameter in climate and oceanographic applications. In this work the scaling behavior of sea level is analyzed from time series of sea level observations. The wavelet domain is particularly attractive for the identification of scaling behavior in an observed time series. The wavelet spectrum from a scale-by-scale wavelet analysis of variance reproduces in the wavelet domain the power laws underlying a scaling process, allowing the estimation of the scaling exponent from the slope of the wavelet spectrum. Here the scaling exponent is estimated in the wavelet domain for time series of sea level observations in the North Atlantic: at coastal sites from tide gauges, covering 50 years of monthly measurements, and in the open ocean from satellite altimetry, covering 12 years of satellite measurements at 10 days intervals. Both tide gauge and altimetry time series exhibit scaling behavior. Furthermore, the degree of stochastic persistence is spatially coherent and distinct at the coast and in the open ocean. Near the coast, the stochastic structure of the sea level observations is characterized by long-range dependence with a moderate degree of persistence. Larger values of the scaling exponent, consistent with weaker persistence, are concentrated in the northern Atlantic. At mid-latitudes the stochastic dependence of sea level observations is characterized by strong persistence in the form of strong long-range and 1/f dependence.","Scaling,North Atlantic,Sea level,Wavelet methods,"
"high resolution-optical tomography for in-process layerwise monitoring of a laser-powder bed fusion technology","2022","With the implementation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion technologies for industrial production, the need for in-process monitoring has emerged to ensure stable conditions and the process to succeed. Indeed, despite significant technological advances, the rejected parts are still too high if compared to the more conventional manufacturing techniques. Several defects are known to affect the process, more likely when complex geometries are fabricated. Among these, the production of inclined thin walls without support structures is still critical and, in most cases, geometric distortions are observed on the overhanging surfaces. In order to overcome the above mentioned problems and improve the quality of these critical structures, an high resolution monitoring system based on Optical Tomography (OT) was proposed, called High Resolution-Optical Tomography (HR-OT). It uses a very high-resolution sensor, operating in the visible spectrum of light, on a large area of the surface layers comprising the entire printing platform. This very recent technique, typically applied for the detection of volumetric defects, such as porosity or lack of fusion, was successfully applied, in this paper, for the detection of geometric distortions, allowing to avoid onerous pre-processing phases in the image processing workflow. Specific geometric indexes were selected as monitoring outputs and were used for the construction of appropriate control charts in order to carry out statistical process monitoring. Finally, an off-line 3D reconstruction, by means of digital close range photogrammetry, was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring solution when applied for in-process detection of geometric distortions.","In-process monitoring,Photogrammetry,AISI 316L,Laser-powder bed fusion,High resolution-optical tomography,"
"harmful algal bloom forecast system for sw ireland. part ii: are operational oceanographic models useful in a hab warning system","2016","This study investigated the application of a three-dimensional physical hydrodynamic model in a harmful algal bloom forecast system for Bantry Bay, southwest Ireland. Modelled oceanographic conditions were studied and used to help understand observed changes in the chemical and biological patterns from the national biotoxins and phytoplankton monitoring program. The study focused on two toxic events in 2013. An upwelling event was predicted by the model prior to the appearance and population increase of potentially toxic diatoms, Pseudo-nitzschia, and associated domoic acid in shellfish. A downwelling episode was provided as a forecast in the model prior to the arrival of a Dinophysis bloom and detection of its associated biotoxins in Bay shellfish. The modelled forecast products developed included expected surface, mid-depth and bottom current pathways at the mouth of the Bay and on the adjacent shelf. The rate and direction of water volume flow at the mouth and mid-bay sections were produced by the model to examine predicted upwelling and downwelling pulses. The model also calculated the evolution of water properties (temperature, salinity and density) with depth along the Bay axis and on the adjacent continental shelf. Direct measurements of water properties at a fixed point, mid-bay, were comparable to model calculations. The operational model for southwest Ireland produces a reliable 3-day physical hydrodynamic forecast of the dominant regional physical processes that result in water exchange events between Bantry Bay and its adjacent shelf. While simulated physical hydrodynamics were provided as a 3-day forecast, the upwelling and downwelling signals from the model, closely linked to toxic HAB episodes, were evident up to 10 days prior to the contamination of shellfish in the Bay.","Modelled products,Ireland,Nowcast/forecast,HAB,"
"spatio-temporal analysis of lightning activity over greece — preliminary results derived from the recent state precision lightning network","2014","Lightning is a natural phenomenon in the atmosphere, being a major cause of storm related deaths, main trigger of forest fires and affects many electrochemical systems of the body. Significant scientific interest has come up in the last decades, as numerous lightning detection networks have been established in operational basis, providing lightning data to assess and mitigate lightning impact to the local society by spatio-temporal analysis. In this study, a preliminary analysis of spatial and temporal variabilities of recorded lightnings over Greece during the period from January 2008 to December 2009 is presented. The data for retrieving the location and time-of-occurrence (TOA) of lightning were acquired from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS). An operational precision lightning network (PLN) has been established since 2007 by HNMS, consisting of eight time-of-arrival (TOA) sensors, spatially distributed across Greek territory. The spatial variability of lightnings revealed their incidence within specific geographical sub-regions while the temporal variability concerns the seasonal and monthly distributions. All the analyses were carried out with respect to cloud to cloud (CC), cloud to ground (CG) and ground to cloud (GC) lightnings, within the examined time period. During the autumn season, lightning activity was the highest, followed by summer and spring. Higher frequencies of stokes appear over Ionian Sea and Aegean Sea than over land during winter period against continental mountainous regions during summer period.","Cloud-to-cloud lightning,Hellenic National Meteorological Service,Operational precision lightning network,Ground-to-cloud lightning,Cloud-to-ground lightning,"
"the utility of body size indices derived from optical plankton counter data for the characterization of marine zooplankton assemblages","2012","To evaluate the utility of size-based indices derived from an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) through detection of spatial and temporal trends in zooplankton biomass, zooplankton size data were collected with an OPC across the Scotian Shelf region of the northwest Atlantic Ocean in April and October of 1997, 1998, and 1999. Eight size-based indices were computed – three simple size metrics (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, coefficient of variation) and metrics derived from the Normalized Biomass Size Spectrum (NBSS; X- and Y-coordinates and curvature of a fitted quadratic function) and the Pareto distribution (Y-intercept and slope). Results indicate that the simple size indices and those derived from the Pareto distribution consistently accounted for the greatest portion of annual variation in zooplankton biomass whereas indices derived from the NBSS accounted only for some secondary patterns. Simple indices also accounted for the greatest portion of spatial variance in zooplankton biomass whereas the NBSS and Pareto accounted for secondary patterns. Patterns in zooplankton communities based on these indices reflected broad taxonomic trends and were related to independent observations on atmospheric and hydrographic conditions in the study area. Size-based zooplankton data from continuous survey instruments can provide powerful adjuncts to both freshwater and marine aquatic monitoring.","Pareto distribution,Optical Plankton Counter,Zooplankton,Body-size index,Scotian Shelf,Size spectrum,"
"recent geomorphological evolution of channel bar in magdalena river (colombia) due to natural and anthropogenic interferences","2022","The growing establishment of port structures in estuarine regions has resulted in alternated sedimentation patterns and new geoforms. The primary purpose of this study is to understand the recent formation and geomorphological evolution of the fluvial bar in the final portion of the Magdalena River. The geomorphological evolution analysis was made possible using Geographic Information Systems tools, satellite images, and bathymetric data. The studied bar formed and stabilized through anthropic and natural factors such as port structures (obstacles to sediment transport), channel morphology, and natural- and anthropic-caused variation to the sediment supply. The lateral bar formation, adjacent to port structures, began in 2017 with surface runoff accumulating and anchored on the riverbank since 2018. At present, the bar covers 45% of the original river width, and an approximate sediment volume worth 4,000,000 m3 has accumulated. Changes in the navigable channel result in slope modification from 2.02° to 5.36°. The construction of port structures, i.e. new pile bridges, changes the natural sediment flow, because they are obstacles, trapping sediments downstream. This period coincides with the end of a weak El Niño cycle, subsequent to a La Nina period also of low intensity, with reduced precipitation rates resulting in a decrease in flow, and therefore contributing to an increase in sedimentation. The observations suggest that it is crucial to understand the channel bars' morphology and origin to avoid possible economic and social impacts due to the disruptions in navigation.","Bathymetry,Satellite images,Navigation,Fluvial,Sedimentation,"
"a geospatial hub to support wind energy and maritime activity spaces near hampton roads, virginia, u.s.a.","2022","The urgent need for clean, sustainable energy development prompts the Commonwealth of Virginia (U.S.A.) to support the development of wind energy in state and federal waters. The port of Hampton Roads is a vital region for maritime commerce, recreation, and national defense, and the state also aims to avert wind development impacts on national security. This project assessed the state of marine geodata portals and decisionsupport methods for wind energy siting and developed a solution to inform energy developers, military stakeholders, and state and local government. An interdisciplinary team developed a user experience (UX) design approach to the problem, gathering persona-driven requirements and designing, prototyping, and testing a solution. Extensive geospatial wind resource data, energy infrastructure, shore and maritime air and vessel activity, protected lands, energy grid connections, and administrative processes are integrated in a web-based solution to screen and assess compatibility. This paper highlights Geographic Information Systems (GIS) used to provide decision support for site suitability analysis of offshore wind energy potential. With a focus on military use spaces, the project sought to gather publicly available activity spaces and areas of critical concern to military siting. We also integrated the newest available maritime vessel traffic activity from AIS data. A user-driven design is applied with GIS data that incorporates the diverse variability of energy, jurisdictional, and potential activity use space conflicts of an increasingly busy maritime environment. The approach taken in this project demonstrates that UX can support the range of developers, regulators, and maritime space users. The WindsiteVA hub spans onshore as well as offshore and nearshore (state waters and the Chesapeake Bay). Spatial analyses include several webmap capabilities, a library of basemaps, site exploration and coordinate conversion tools, reporting tools, and metadata and external data resources. Users are guided through pathways unique to personas: Developers, government agency personnel, or military personnel. As a â€œone-stop toolâ€ the webbased site is accessible publicly and utilizes Esri ArcGIS Hub technology. The site steps users through critical processes and data elements, such as informal queries, Notice of Proposed Construction for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), VA Department of Environmental Quality Permit by Rule (PBR), the US Department of Defense siting clearinghouse, and other procedures. Results suggest improved spatial decision-making and marine spatial planning can be achieved at minimal cost by combining UX design and geospatial hub technology. Wind resource development around seaports can be optimized and spatial conflicts reduced, costs lowered, and cumulative impacts identified. WindSiteVA captures complex processes and major concerns for wind energy availability and military concerns, yet it is not redundant with other policies or rules nor does it reflect sitescale reviews such as environmental impact assessments. Early results of WindSiteVA show that a screening-level approach can assist wind energy developers in coastal inshore and offshore waters, where relatively abundant wind energy resources exist, and reduce impacts to military and national defense and other maritime activities.","decision support systems,maritime vessel traffic activity,maritime commerce,wind energy availability,user experience design,vessel activity,web-based solution,government agency personnel,WindSiteVA captures complex process,Costs,maritime space users,Geospatial analysis,administrative process,wind energy siting,maritime activity spaces,UX design,extensive geospatial wind resource data,wind energy developers,webbased site,maritime air,military concerns,offshore waters,Hampton Roads,Esri ArcGIS Hub technology,local government,wind development impacts,persona-driven requirements,Virginia,clean energy development,wind energy resources,maritime activity space,military stakeholders,environmental impact assessments,Seaports,offshore wind energy potential,sustainable energy development,military personnel,Wind energy,Wind,busy maritime environment,external data resources,military siting,site suitability analysis,user-driven design,offshore installations,geographic information systems,wind power,publicly available activity spaces,military use spaces,national defense,US Department of Defense,Roads,Federal Aviation Administration,offshore wind,GIS data,geospatial hub,geographic information system,national security,energy grid connections,federal waters,wind resource development,WindsiteVA hub,energy infrastructure,maritime activities,site suitability,marine geodata portals,informal queries,AIS data,screening-level approach,FAA,"
"high resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects","2003","This paper presents the results of high resolution magnetic cartography realized with a caesium vapor magnetometer on marshland plots in Western France. This site is interesting because of the clayey substratum homogeneity and the historical knowledge of plot exploitation. A wooden truck running on PVC rails allowed acquisition of accurate signals with dynamics of about 2 nT. Natural grassland presents weak decametric variations correlated to a micro-toposequence. Conversely, plots recently tilled show linear magnetic anomalies. These anomalies are interpreted as the effect of tractor tyre soil compaction which modify soil properties. In addition, the study of a drained plot, by a wavelet transform, reveals the presence of a frequency band close to the drain intervals. Moreover, the magnitude of the linear magnetic anomalies is higher above drains. This suggests that the compaction influence on the magnetic carriers is more important in drained, hence aerated, zones.","magnetic survey,soil tillage,compaction,drainage,"
"detection of diffusion and contact zones of early farming in europe from the space-time distribution of 14c dates","2009","The spread of early farming in Europe is revisited using a sample of 3072 audited 14C calBC dates from 940 georeferenced early Neolithic sites. The surface expansion of early Neolithic has been reconstituted using the kriging technique of spatial interpolation. Centres of renewed expansion, of contact zones, and the main routes of expansion have been highlighted by means of a vector map, representing the gradient. The expansion of the agricultural system on the map, was not uniform and regular across Europe as a whole, but proceeded in leaps. With the scale of detection of the 500-year isochrones, several leaps are identifiable: at 8000 calBC crossing the Taurus barrier, 6700–6100 calBC crossing the southern Adriatic barrier, 6100–5600 calBC crossing the Central European agro-ecological barrier and 5000–4000 calBC expanding on the other, marginal zones. Using a vector map, 10 points of renewed expansion and nine contact zones, were detected. The whole does not correspond to a process of homogeneous diffusion, approximately steady, but a process marked by phases of geographical expansion and stasis.","Early Neolithic Europe,14C dates,Arrhythmic model,Expansion of early farming,Renewed expansion,Contact zones,Vector map,"
"anomaly detection in maritime domain based on spatio-temporal analysis of ais data using graph neural networks","2021","One of the critical applications of trajectory mining is Event Detection, where an automatized task identifies the deviation of a vesselâ€™s movement from its standard route. Conventionally, Origin-Destination matrix data is utilized for event detection which has limitations such as removal of temporal aspect of data and inability to access to trajectory features such as speed of vessel from origin to destination. To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval. We further propose Graph Network Deviation Detector (GNDD), which leverages graph embedding and context embedding techniques to capture anomalies in the spatio-temporal patterns of movement. Extensive experiments applied on five real-world AIS datasets show that our method achieved promising results in identifying abnormal movements.","Graph neural networks,critical applications,data mining,graph embedding,event detection,Automatic information system,Anomaly detection,matrix algebra,Graph Network Deviation Detector,abnormal movements,Origin-Destination matrix data,Feature extraction,movement pattern,neural nets,Directed graphs,temporal aspect,marine systems,automatized task,Signal processing,maritime domain,directed graphs,Artificial intelligence,trajectory mining,standard route,graph theory,anomaly Detection,Spatiotemporal graph embeddings,real-world AIS datasets,spatio-temporal analysis,Trajectory,trajectory features,aforementioned features,Event detection,AIS data,"
"monitoring the algerian basin through glider observations, satellite altimetry and numerical simulations along a saral/altika track","2018","The Algerian Basin is a key component of the general circulation in the Western Mediterranean Sea. The presence of both fresh Atlantic water and more saline Mediterranean water gives the basin an intense inflow/outflow regime and complex circulation patterns. Energetic mesoscale structures that evolve from meanders of the Algerian Current into isolated cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies dominate the area, with marked repercussions on biological activity. Despite its remarkable importance, this region and its variability are still poorly known and basin-wide knowledge of its meso- and submesoscale features is still incomplete. Studying such complex processes requires a synergistic approach that involves integrated observing systems. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of combined use of autonomous underwater vehicles, such as gliders, with a new generation of satellite altimetry. In this context, we present results of an observational program conducted in the Algerian Basin during fall 2014 and 2015 that aimed to advance our knowledge of its main features. The study was carried out through analysis of high resolution glider observations, collected along the Algerian BAsin Circulation Unmanned Survey (ABACUS) chokepoint, in synergy with co-located SARAL/AltiKa altimetric products and CMEMS numerical simulations. Results show that glider-derived dynamic height and SARAL/AltiKa absolute dynamic topography have similar patterns, with RMS of the differences ranging between 1.11 and 2.90 cm. Even though larger discrepancies are observed near the Balearic and Algerian coasts, correlation coefficients between glider and satellite observations seem mostly to be affected by reduced synopticity between the measurements. Glider observations acquired during the four surveys reveal the presence of several water masses of Atlantic and Mediterranean origin (i.e., AW and LIW at different modification levels) with marked seasonal variability.","Algerian Basin,CMEMS models,Satellite altimetry,Glider observations,SARAL-AltiKa along track data,"

"enterprise resilience and sustainability for operations of maritime container ports","2019","Recent trends in markets, technologies, demographics, regulations, organizations, energy, and environments require adaptations for operations of container ports. This paper describes resilience of ports to emergent conditions in three areas: Energy and fuels, controls and automation, and logistics transformation. First, the sustainability of energy and fuels have become a priority for ports due to growing concerns of carbon emissions. Liquified natural gas (LNG) is both a cost-effective and safe alternative fuel for reducing emissions of container ships. The feasibility and several strategies for adopting LNG bunkering at ports are described. Second, ports must leverage technological development to drive greater efficiency and operative resiliency. Recent developments in industrial automation and electrification are described. Lastly, the impact of corporate development to the region of the port is discussed. An analysis of enterprise capacity expansion includes both risks and benefits to increase competitiveness. This paper uses methodology of systems and data analysis, mathematical simulation, and risk cost-benefit optimization. The key results include identifying operational and security risks for container ports and providing strategies for risk mitigation and resilience.

"halophyte die-off in response to anthropogenic impacts on tidal flats","2014","This study analyzed an abrupt change in halophyte populations, especially the annual plant Suaeda japonica. The boundaries and distributions of S. japonica and Phragmites australis were determined based on the decision tree classifier of TerraSAR-X, SAVI of Landsat ETM+, and density slicing of aerial photography. A large patch of S. japonica in the eastern parts of Donggum-do, South Korea, disappeared in 2007, while populations have been stable in the western parts of the island. To understand the reason behind the sudden die-off, mean sea level was analyzed based on gaged tidal data. Sedimentation rate was measured using Vernier caliper and RTK leveling data. Sedimentation rate between 2006 and 2007 was above the threshold at which S. japonica can germinate. After the loss of an 11-ha S. japonica patch from the eastern part of Donggum-do, sedimentation was accelerated because of a decrease in tidal current caused by a series of land reclamation projects. The increased monthly exposure duration due to continuous sediment accretion altered the type of salt marsh. Our results imply that accumulated effects from a series of coastal construction projects around Ganghwa-do can change not only tide and current hydrodynamics, but also sedimentation and erosion rates, which can cause large halophyte patches to disappear.","halophyte,sedimentation,tidal flat,salt marsh,"

"chemostratigraphy: a method to improve interwell correlation in barren sequences — a case study using onshore duckmantian/stephanian sequences (west midlands, u.k.)","1999","Chemostratigraphy has been applied to onshore Duckmantian/Stephanian successions encountered in outcrop and penetrated by two boreholes from the West Midlands (U.K.). These successions represent the onshore equivalents of the `Barren Red Measures' which are important hydrocarbon-bearing sequences in the Southern North Sea. Much is known about the onshore successions in terms of sedimentology, mineralogy and provenance and thus they provide the ideal test for the validity of chemostratigraphy as a stratigraphic tool. Reliable inorganic geochemical data have been acquired from geochemical analyses of core, sidewall core and cuttings samples, with 19 elements being determined. Stratigraphic variations in elemental concentrations are compared with known variations in the mineralogical data. The established lithostratigraphic units of the Duckmantian/Stephanian intervals can also be recognized from the geochemical data and by using these data can be subdivided further. This results in an independent chemostratigraphic correlation being established for the two boreholes, which has been assessed statistically by discriminant function analysis. From the geochemical and mineralogical data, distinct changes in provenance are identified within the Upper Carboniferous successions. The sediments of the Coal Measures were derived from a north westerly and westerly source (?Caledonian), whereas the Etruria Formation sediments came from the Wales Brabant Massif, the sediments having mixed Caledonian and Cadomian characteristics. Eventually these sediments were replaced by sediments from a southern Hercynian source (Halesowen and Salop Formations).","chemostratigraphy,Upper Carboniferous,correlation,provenance,"

Outlier detection strategy is used to efficiently explore the road network and remove irrelevant patterns and noise. The resulting graph is then implemented to train an extended graph convolutional neural network to estimate the traffic flow in the city. To accurately tune the hyperparameter values of the proposed framework, a new optimization technique is developed based on branch and bound.

The results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baseline solutions, especially when the number of nodes in the graph is large.","Forecasting,Deep learning,Graph convolution neural network,Smart roads,"
"global change and the measurement of absolute sea-level","1987","To quantify properly the long-term response of sea-level to climate change, land motions must be separated from the apparent or relative sea-level change recorded by conventional tide/sea-level gauges. Here we present a concept for global measurement of the true or “absolute” sea-level change, which combines recent advances in space-based geodetic techniques with plans for a global sea-level network under the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Data from initial feasibility tests show that land motion, due to global (plate tectonic), regional (glacial rebound), or local (fluid withdrawal) effects, can probably be measured to ±1cm (on a single measurement basis) by an innovative combination of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) tevhniques. By making repeated observations of position at a number of tide gauges using portable, economical GPS receivers in a differential mode relative to the fewer, more stable, but more expensive VLBI observatories, it will be possible to subtract land motion from the relative sea-level signal. Decadal to century scale trends at the 1–2mm y−1 level will be resolvable in the sea-level and vertical land motion time series within about a decade. Detection of subsidence or uplift at specific gauges will allow correction for land motion or deletion of bad data when computing regional or global, i.e. eustatic, sea-level changes. In addition to their applications in oceanography and climate studies, such data will test models by Peltier and other that relate mantle viscosity and deglaciation history to present rates of crustal subsidence or uplift. If the predicted crustal motions are confirmed, we can also have more confidence in the use of historical tide/sea-level gauge records in retrospective studies of sea-level change related to climate variability on decadal or longer time scales. It is concluded that as few as one-third (about 100) of the total number of tide/sea-level gauges (250–300) required for global climate research programmes (WYRTKI and PUGH, 1984) need to be upgraded to “sea-level observatory” status, in terms of sensors and geodetic control, to build a two tier sea-level network that will provide the data needed to solve many problems of both relative and absolute sea-level change. Such a network will provide basic information supporting research on a wide range of questions related to “global change”.",""
"variability and change in the west antarctic peninsula marine system: research priorities and opportunities","2019","The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","Primary production,Physical oceanography,Southern Ocean,Ecosystems,Sea ice,Nutrient and carbon cycling,Antarctica,Climate change,West Antarctic Peninsula,"
"a bayesian parametric statistical anomaly detection method for finding trends and patterns in criminal behavior","2013","In this paper we describe how Bayesian Principal Anomaly Detection (BPAD) can be used for detecting long and short term trends and anomalies in geographically tagged alarm data. We elaborate on how the detection of such deviations can be used for high-lighting suspected criminal behavior and activities. BPAD has previously been successively deployed and evaluated in several similar domains, including Maritime Domain Awareness, Train Fleet Maintenance, and Alarm filtering. Similar as for those applications, we argue in the paper that the deployment of BPAD in area of crime monitoring potentially can improve the situation awareness of criminal activities, by providing automatic detection of suspicious behaviors, and uncovering large scale patterns.","Anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Monitoring,Situation awareness,Data analysis,Image color analysis,behavioural sciences computing,geographically tagged alarm data,situation awareness improvement,Bayesian statistics,Bayesian parametric statistical anomaly detection method,criminal behavior trends,BPAD,Criminal behaviour,criminal behavior pattern,crime monitoring,suspected criminal behavior,suspicious behavior automatic detection,Market research,suspected criminal activities,Data collection,Data mining,police data processing,"
"integrating observational targets and instrumental data on rock coasts through snorkel surveys: a methodological approach","2020","This work deals with recent advances in scientific snorkel surveying, starting from the results of several case studies in the Mediterranean between 2012 and 2018, for a total survey length of 531.4 km, with the aim of illustrating the pros and cons. The snorkel survey method, described here, also called ‘Geoswim’, allows rough-and-ready surveys of long sectors of rocky coasts. In particular, it is able to collect time-lapse images perpendicularly to the coastline and observe long sectors of rocky coastline, with particular reference to the tidal zone. In addition to the photographic survey along the coast, rough measures, lateral variations in geomorphological, geological, biological, and ecological parameters and the collection of hydrological data are usually performed during the work. The expeditions also provide the opportunity to produce large databases of coastal landforms such as coastal sea caves and tidal notches. The data collected can be improved by additional on-the-spot observations. The evaluation of the methodology here proposed was based on the results of SWOT analysis starting from the results and the experience of previous expeditions. Geoswim is the first snorkel approach that allows the collection of large amount of multidisciplinary data along wide sectors of rocky coastline. At the moment, this approach is the best and probably the only technique for characterizing the tidal and nearshore zone, but also to collect observational data of prominent objects along rocky coasts. However, snorkel observations are affected by limitations similar to those of terrestrial field surveys. The ability to observe specific forms or phenomena increases through the practice of field observation and are strongly observer-influenced. Sheltered sea basins are better suited than ocean basins, where tides and wave energy are generally higher. Data collection is also affected by weather and sea conditions. The quality of time-lapse images and videos may be reduced as a result of breakers at the cliffs, producing images that cannot be used for subsequent analysis. As for external factors, some sectors of the coast may be closed due to local restrictions on field activities.","Mediterranean Sea,Sea caves,Geoswim,Coastal geomorphology,Tidal notches,Swim and snorkel surveys,"
"experimental verification of ecological interface prototype issued by an automated generation tool","2015","Vicente and Rasmussen have developed a method called Ecological Interface Design (EID) in the field of cognitive engineering .[1] In this context, we proposed a software tool named Anaxagore, that can assist the EID process for a rapid implementation of user interface prototypes. In a first stage, models based on standardized structure-functional diagram are computed .[2] In a second stage, these diagrams as inputs are transformed through a model-driven engineering process, involving a library of ecological graphical representations and an interface background. Then, an ecological interface prototype can be generated. Previously, Anaxagore was used to generate conventional synoptic representation .[3] To validate its EID extended version, an experimental protocol has been established. The experiment was conducted at the National Maritime College, with 14 naval officers randomly divided into two groups according to the used interface. After a preliminary training of participants to the use of the interfaces, four scenarios were simulated during the experiment. For each scenario, the performance was evaluated by a success score and by measuring the time to detect and understand failure. With the EID interface generated by Anaxagore, faster detection time and better diagnosis accuracy were observed. Anaxagore seems to constitute a response for assisting the rapid prototyping of ecological interface.","automatic generation,ecological interface design,protyping,design,"
"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"
"reconstructing holocene shore displacement and stone age palaeogeography from a foredune sequence on ruhnu island, gulf of riga, baltic sea","2018","Holocene shore displacement and the palaeogeography of Late Mesolithic and Late Neolithic settlements on Ruhnu Island, Gulf of Riga, were reconstructed using foredune sequence luminescence dating, sedimentological data supported by ground-penetrating radar analysis, and GIS-based landscape modelling. The foredune ridges consist of very well to well sorted fine- to medium-grained aeolian sand and are underlain by seaward dipping foreshore sediments. The studied sequence of 38 ridges was formed between 6.91±0.58ka and 2.54±0.19ka ago, and represents a period of falling relative sea level. Foredune plain progradation, with average rates of 0.3–0.6m per year, was controlled by isostatic land uplift, which caused a continuous withdrawal of shorelines to lower elevations. The dated foredune succession was used to reconstruct the coastal palaeogeography of the island. Palaeogeographical reconstructions show that during two phases of Late Mesolithic habitation, at ca. 7.2cal.ka BP and 6.2cal.ka BP, seal hunters settled the coastal zone of Ruhnu Island. Based on tool material and pottery type they could have originated from Saaremaa Island, which according to palaeoreconstruction of the Gulf of Riga, was located approximately 70km northwest of Ruhnu Island during the Late Mesolithic. Later signs of human occupation, radiocarbon dated to ca. 4.7cal.ka BP, were from the centre of the island, hundreds of metres away from the shore at about 8m above its contemporary sea level. This Late Neolithic habitation shows a clearly different pattern than earlier coastal settlement, and suggests a shift in subsistence strategy towards agriculture and animal husbandry.","Foredune,Stone Age settlement,Luminescence dating,Palaeogeography,Baltic Sea,Sea level changes,Beach ridges,"

"obstacle avoidance and target search of an autonomous surface vehicle for 2016 maritime robotx challenge","2017","This paper describes algorithms for Autonomous Surface Vehicle(ASV) obstacle avoidance and target search task. This work is primarily designed for task mission of 2016 Maritime RobotX competition. In this task, ASV must avoid obstacle buoys, while it is searching for totem-shaped buoy. To deal with such problem, algorithms for both perception and motion planning stage was designed. In perception stage, 2D scanning LIDAR and monocular vision sensor are used to detect any floating objects on the water. To recognize target (totem buoy), HSV color space information was used. Detected object (both obstacle and totem buoy) information is tracked by using Kalman filter. In action planning stage, both deliberative and reflexive action [2] planning are designed. In deliberative action planning stage, based on the Kalman filter tracked obstacle information, a grid map can be generated. Using the grid map and A* search algorithm, desired path for searching totem can be calculated. In reflexive action planning stage, once ASV accidently enters hazardous region, where it has high probability of getting collide, it is designed to reflexively escape the region by making pure sway motion.

"shelf-wide analyses of sand wave migration using gis: a case study on the netherlands continental shelf","2023","Shelf seas often display rhythmic bedforms, of which tidal sand waves are the most relevant to study from an engineering point of view due to their dimensions and dynamic nature. Environmental conditions such as water depth, flow velocities and grain size vary across entire shelf regions, consequently influencing the characteristics of tidal sand waves, including migration rates. However, as opposed to site-specific analyses, shelf sea-wide analyses on sand wave migration are scarce. Through the use of timeseries of bathymetric data, we investigate the spatial variability of sand wave migration on the scale of the Netherlands Continental Shelf (NCS). Two existing data-driven techniques, Pairs of Source and Target Points (PSTP) and Spatial Cross Correlation (SCC), were implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Through testing at four sites on the NCS, PSTP was deemed the preferred technique for a shelf-wide analysis and was hence used to quantify the NCS-wide migration rates and directions. To illustrate the spatial variability, the quantified migration rates and directions were averaged per km2. For the NCS in general, migration to the south-west or north-east at typical rates between 0 and 3 m/year was found. The south-western region of the NCS demonstrated migration rates below 0.5 m/year with migration directions alternating over short distances. The north-eastern region exhibited uniform migration to the north-east at rates which gradually increased when in closer proximity to the Wadden Islands. Typical rates in this region were found to be between 2 and 8 m/year. The highest migration rates were observed near coastal regions and on top of sandbanks. The presence of these sandbanks strongly deflects the migration directions of superimposed sand waves at a number of locations. The analysis performed within this study demonstrates valuable insights into methods that can be used to evaluate shelf-wide regions of interest. A deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of the North Sea bed assists in optimising hydrographic re-survey policies, critical infrastructure planning and subsequent monitoring. Furthermore, this study may offer a wider set of tools that could be used for correlating sand wave migration to its governing physical mechanisms and environmental parameters.","North Sea,Data analysis,Spatial variation,Tidal sand wave migration,GIS,Netherlands Continental Shelf,"

"jurassic-recent stratigraphy, structure, and hydrocarbon potential of the mesozoic-cenozoic rifted-passive margin of the tarfaya-dakhla basin of southern morocco","2022","We describe the structure, stratigraphy, and hydrocarbon potential of the 1000-km-long Tarfaya-Dakhla Basin (TDB) along the Atlantic rifted-passive margin of Morocco. Our dataset consists of a 4885-line km grid of depth-converted industry seismic data tied to three DSDP wells in the deepwater area and exploratory wells on the slope and shelf. Based on mapping of this seismic grid, the tectonostratigraphic events that have affected this margin include: 1) a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rift phase that separated the Moroccan margin from its conjugate margin in eastern Canada began during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic; 2) early passive margin sedimentation consists of Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous passive margin phase consisting of a massive, 14-km-thick, reefal-carbonate platform formed above the rifted margin during the Early Jurassic and was subsequently buried by the 6-km-thick, Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Boujdour deltaic complex. During this period continued high rates of clastic sedimentation resulted in margin steepening and gravitational collapse during the Valanginian and formed a 480-km-long and 68-km-wide passive margin fold belt characterized by a zone of updip normal faults of 480 km in length and 30 km in width and a zone of downdip folds and thrusts of 117 km in length and 15 km in width. Geochemical data from DSDP 397 and 369 wells and two pseudo-wells were used to evaluate source rock potential and hydrocarbon prospectivity of the Jurassic to Recent section. Basin modeling reveals that the Jurassic source rocks known from DSDP drilling are presently overmature in the study area with hydrocarbon generation beginning in the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous. The Lower Cretaceous source rocks are immature except for localized areas, and the Upper Cretaceous is immature across the study area.","Basin modeling,Shale detachment,Passive margin fold belt,Area-depth strain analysis,Offshore southern Morocco,Stratigraphy,Seismic interpretation,"
"assessing the range of radio maritime links in different waterbodies: effect of antenna height and band diversities","2021","In this paper, we analyze the weather information for 14 waterbodies from geographical areas with different meteorological characteristics. We estimate the sub-hourly instances of the evaporation duct height (EDH) throughout a period of 10 years. Then, considering the frequency range 1 to 6 GHz, based on the parabolic equation method, we analyze the quality for a presumed shore-to-ship link throughout 100 km range. We evaluate the maximum range that can be supported for different reliability requirements and we focus specifically on analyzing the gain that can be obtained when antenna height and/or band diversity are used. It was found that for high reliability requirements, the antenna height at the shore is the main factor on deciding the maximum communication range that can be maintained. On the other hand, for applications that tolerate delay and work seasonally on an opportunistic basis, the evaporation duct statistics is the main factor deciding the likelihood of increasing the link range and establishing over-the-horizon communications.","telecommunication network reliability,Antennas,evaporation duct height distributions,reliability requirements,Ducts,Delays,Conferences,microwave antennas,EDH,Reliability,Vehicular and wireless technologies,time 10.0 year,size 100.0 km,antenna height diversity,shore-to-ship communications,band diversities,Meteorology,band diversity,statistical analysis,maximum communication range,parabolic equation method,link range,frequency 1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz,meteorological characteristics,evaporation duct height,evaporation duct statistics,weather information,radio maritime links,over-the-horizon communications,shore-to-ship link,parabolic equations,marine communication,geographical areas,water bodies,antenna height,"

Its life span generally expands from a few days to weeks and the destruction caused by its combined effect of duration and size is incomparable to any other forms of atmospheric disturbances. In this sense, in order to assess its impact on infrastructure and properties, and to save innocent lives, remote sensing (RS) techniques, and platforms can be employed. In an operational basis, RS and geographical information system are mostly used for monitoring of TCs and early warning. In this chapter, an insight on the use of RS platforms is provided for TC research and forecasting along with the application to the study of their detection, radial, structural, meteorological, and ocean characteristic features. Furthermore, the impact of satellite RS on TC forecast with respect to reduction in track and forecast errors is discussed.

"brainstem calcification in möbius syndrome","2004","Möbius syndrome is characterized by congenital facial diplegia, and may be associated with limb or orofacial malformations. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis, including prenatal ischemia. We identified seven children with Möbius syndrome over the 10-year interval 1992-2001, all of whom manifested incomplete bilateral facial palsy. Associated limb and orofacial anomalies were observed in six cases. Computed tomographic scans were available in six children, and five of them manifested brainstem calcification which was most prominent in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The calcification was detected as early as 7 days of age and did not change with time, suggesting a static condition of prenatal onset. These observations support the hypothesis that the pathology in Möbius syndrome is secondary to prenatal brain ischemia.",""
"how maritime education and training (met) instructors address assessment protocol","2020","With the advent of more technologies being utilized on a modern Ships Navigational Bridge it is important to address all human elements that play a role in the safety of the vessel. Of these elements, the training of personal in the use of the ships modern equipment is imperative. To address this, the maritime industry both on the international and national levels implements a series of assessments to validate a potential officer's knowledge base. This study looks to identify the Maritime Bridge Simulators instructor's interpretation of the assessments done on a Navigation simulator. An Auto Ethnographic approach is utilized to highlight current and previous interactions with the former Mariners, who are now educators. These Maritime Education and Training (MET) instructors, who utilize a modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator, as they assess a navigational bridge team will be examined. The preliminary understanding and projected findings is that both the performance based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. However, the assessments themselves which are mandated, are vague and unsuccessful in properly assessing a future Maritime Officer. As Mariners have all experienced some subject matter experts who may have all of the qualifications needed to teach, yet are incapable of doing so. On the other hand, some may not have mastery of the subject but are able to pass on the knowledge needed for one to succeed sufficiently. In a worst-case scenario, there are those who â€œcan neither do nor teach.â€ How can we prevent these instances from offering? Is there something within mandated regulations that can be used to avoid this from occurring? Could there be a cultural or societal aspect that we can use as a preventative means? These questions are difficult to answer. There is a need to be judged on many levels, as well as discussed and debated. Instructors in the Maritime industry are no different than the Instructors in other fields. They have all been exposed to the subject that they are required to teach, how they prepare and interpret the lessons needed is not always the same as one would think. Simulation as an educational tool has been used across a broad spectrum of subjects and industries. How these simulations are integrated within the classroom differs depending on the simulator. One of the main objectives of simulation is Project-Based learning. Simulations that encompass the Project-Based Learning design can be defined as complex tasks based on difficult questions. These situations provoke the student to design, implement problem-solving, and decision making processes. The fact-finding activities embedded in the simulation can provide students with situations where they need to work independently over significant periods. At the end of the simulation, there is a concluding event that emulates realistic products or situations [1]. In addition to the â€œProjectâ€ associated with this theory, there are other defining factors; these factors include authentic content, authentic assessment, teacher facilitation, and clear educational goals[2]. All of these play a significant role within the realm of Maritime Simulation. For a successful Simulation of a Ships Navigational bridge to occur, the preliminary understanding and projected findings is that the performance-based assessment and the interactive assessments done on these simulators, inform teaching and enhance learning experiences. In order to accomplish this, many challenges are facing the educators that operate these simulated exercises. The first challenge is the Professional Development of the educators. Unlike most professional educators, the requirements to teach within this field are limited. The students that these instructors teach also differ in that they are an older student. This method is called Andragogy. The way the instructor approaches this must be different from the Petrological approach of young students. The final challenge addressed here is the instructor's interpretation of both international and national regulations. By utilizing Authentic Assessment, educators need to cultivate a better understanding of the concept or subject taught and focus less on the improved learning outcomes associated with them [3].","international regulations,interactive assessments,Project-Based Learning,human elements,project-based learning design,Regulation,Andragogy,assessment protocol,MET Instructors,Industries,Marine vehicles,modern ships navigational bridge,potential officer,maritime simulation,Bridges,Instructor Training,educational courses,preliminary understanding,Mariners,Maritime Simulation,ships,Authentic Assessment,navigational bridge team,marine engineering,clear educational goals,international levels,educational tool,Auto Ethnographic approach,computer based training,decision making,Professional Development,modern Full Mission Bridge Simulator,ships modern equipment,simulated exercises,teaching,Maritime Education and Training,performance-based assessment,MET,subject matter experts,Performance-based Assessment,future maritime officer,professional educators,maritime industry,Navigation,Task analysis,performance based assessment,Tools,authentic assessment,learning experiences,maritime education and training instructors,navigation simulator,maritime bridge simulators instructor,"

"regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge in ireland combining medium resolution satellite imagery and geochemical tracing techniques","2012","This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM+ TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of 222Rn (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.","Radon,Landsat ETM+,Submarine groundwater discharge,Salinity,Thermal remote sensing,Geochemical tracing,"

Data were collected at five contrasting stations within the Indonesian archipelago, found above energetic straits or in relatively quiescent large basins. Strong instabilities, inversions of the density profiles and a very strong water mass transformation were observed. A wide range of dissipation values were obtained (between [10−10, 10−4]Wkg−1) with spots of higher dissipation in the ocean interior correlated with a strong internal tide signal. Both the fine-scale and micro-scale methods allow us to identify very strong energy dissipation levels above the straits, ranging between [10−7, 10−4]Wkg−1, in contrast to lower values at stations further away from the generation sites. The dissipation for the station located in the center of the Halmahera Sea ([10−9, 10−8]Wkg−1) is stronger than for the Banda station ([10−11, 10−10]Wkg−1), which is even further away from the generation sites. The three approaches agree relatively well and provide vertical eddy diffusivities values ranging between 5×10−4 and 5×10−1m2s−1, except in the Banda Sea where values are similar to the ones found in the open ocean (10−6m2s−1). CTD and XCTD profilers (deployed between stations) give estimates of dissipation all along the transit. It is found that enhanced mixing occurs preferentially above rough topography, such as in the Ombai Strait, the Halmahera Sea’s northern entrance, the Buru strait and Sumba strait. Finestructure parameters are very sensitive to depth and dissipation, which differs between stations. We recommend more systematic microstructure measurement in order to tune these parameters. Surface mixing, at the base of the mixed layer is found to be very strong with values between [10−4, 10−3m2s−1]. These results confirm the modeling studies that suggest the occurrence of intensified subsurface mixing which cools the sea surface temperatures and thus strongly affects the mean and variability of the tropical climate. We conclude, therefore, that climate models need to take into account this intensified ocean mixing to properly represent the mean state of the atmosphere and its climate variability.","Vertical mixing,Microstructure,Internal tides,Natural radionuclides,Finestructure,Indonesian seas,"

Beginning with the first altimetry experiment in May 1973 that provided a general information on large-scale dynamics of the ocean, the advance in technology and processing in regional seas and near coasts has made possible detection and better characterization of mesoscale and small-scale features (e.g., eddies, boundary current, coastal upwelling, and sea-level rise).","Ocean dynamics,Asian shelf seas,Coastal altimetry,"
"timing of the neoglacial onset on the north-eastern antarctic peninsula based on lacustrine archive from lake anónima, vega island","2020","To understand the complexity of the climate patterns in the Holocene, it is necessary to build detailed chronologies that provide a holistic picture of the individual climate periods occurring in the polar regions. In this regard, here we present a completely new, 14C-dated and synchronised multi-proxy chronology from the Lake Anónima (Vega Island, north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula) that provides a unique insight into the Late Holocene environment. In particular, we aim to interpret the substantial environmental and climatic change between the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal and Neoglacial periods using various geochemical (total organic carbon, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy), petrophysical (magnetic susceptibility, laser granulometry) and biological (diatom biostratigraphy) proxies. The termination of the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal, characterised by overall warmer climate with favourable conditions for biogenic productivity, is followed by the regional-scale Neoglacial period, distinctive by the onset of climate deterioration, decreased siliciclastic input, suppressed biogenic (diatom) productivity and low organic content. Based on a principal component analysis, a multi-proxy record provides the precise timing of the Neoglacial onset in the Lake Anónima record at 2050 (2σ: 1990–2130) cal. yrs BP. Applying an adjacent and correlative ice-core (James Ross Island ice cap, r = 0.42), as well as a composite lake sediment (Beak Island, r = 0.49) chronologies, our research provides a refined timing of the Neoglacial onset for the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula, which is determined to be 2070 ± 50 yrs.

Moreover, the Neoglacial onset was compared with other studies from respective parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.","Multi-proxy,James Ross Archipelago,Mid-late Holocene hypsithermal,Neoglacial,Antarctic Peninsula,Lake record,"

"knowledge discovery using genetic algorithm for maritime situational awareness","2014","Due to the large volume of data related to vessels, to manually pore through and to analyze the information in a bid to identify potential maritime threat is tedious, if at all possible. This study aims to enhance maritime situational awareness through the use of computational intelligence techniques in detecting anomalies. A knowledge discovery system based on genetic algorithm termed as GeMASS was proposed and investigated in this research. In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels’ geographical and movement information. This study investigated a novel leverage of multiple data sources, including Automatic Identification System, classification societies, and port management and security systems for the enhancement of maritime security. A prototype of GeMASS was developed and employed as a vehicle to study and demonstrate the functions of the proposed methodology.","Defense,Maritime security,Genetic algorithm,Knowledge discovery,Decision support,Machine learning,"
"reconstructing the landscape evolution and the human occupation of the lower sagone river (western corsica, france) from the bronze age to the medieval period","2017","This paper aims to reconstruct the landscape evolution together with the vegetation history of the lower Sagone Valley, Western Corsica, which was occupied from the Bronze Age to the Medieval Period. Adopting a geoarchaeological approach, the combination of sedimentological, palynological, and geophysical data enables the reconstruction of various stages in the landscape evolution of the Lower Sagone River over the last 4000years, together with the history of human occupation. The methods consist of a palaeoenvironmental study of 9 boreholes drilled in the modern deltaic plain, at a maximum distance of 500m from the present-day shoreline. The laboratory analyses included mollusk identification and measurements of the grain-size distribution (by wet sieving). A series of 21 radiocarbon dates on charcoal, plant remains, wood fragments, and marine mollusk samples formed the basis for a chronostratigraphy. In order to reconstruct the vegetation history of the catchment, with particular attention to anthropogenic activity, pollen analysis was conducted on clay samples from the deepest borehole, and they revealed a semi-open forest during the Bronze Age and Late Iron Age with extensive pastoral activity and limited cereal cultivation. Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT) of 3 profiles across the alluvial plain was conducted in order to reveal the geometry of the sedimentary bodies. The salient features are the presence of a freshwater lake during the Mid- to Late Bronze Age (from 1500 to 1100cal. BCE), its transformation into an open marine bay from ca. 1100 until 500cal. BCE, and the formation of a confined lagoon from 500cal. BCE to 200cal. CE.",""
"cultural dynamics and ceramic resource use at late bronze age/early iron age troy, northwestern turkey","2013","Changes in resource use over time can provide insight into technological choice and the extent of long-term stability in cultural practices. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence for a marked demographic shift at the inception of the Early Iron Age at Troy by applying a robust macroscale analysis of changing ceramic resource use over the Late Bronze and Iron Age. We use a combination of new and legacy analytical datasets (NAA and XRF), from excavated ceramics, to evaluate the potential compositional range of local resources (based on comparisons with sediments from within a 10 km site radius). Results show a clear distinction between sediment-defined local and non-local ceramic compositional groups. Two discrete local ceramic resources have been previously identified and we confirm a third local resource for a major class of EIA handmade wares and cooking pots. This third source appears to derive from a residual resource on the Troy peninsula (rather than adjacent alluvial valleys). The presence of a group of large and heavy pithoi among the non-local groups raises questions about their regional or maritime origin.","Local production,Bottom-up sampling,Macro-analysis,Multivariate analysis,Neutron Activation Analysis,Statistical power relationships,Legacy datasets,"
"assessment of arctic snow stratigraphy and water equivalent using a portable frequency modulated continuous wave radar","2023","There is significant spatial variability in snow cover characteristics across the Arctic. Current physical or empirical approaches to simulate or measure snow state variables suffer from poor spatial and/or temporal resolutions. Our current understanding of the spatio-temporal variability in Arctic snow cover leads to uncertainties in existing snow property retrievals from space or in models, thus leading to a poor representation of the snow cover in various climate models and reanalysis products. In this paper, we developed a method to derive total snow depth from a ground-based radar as well as distinguishing the two main layers generally observed in Arctic snowpacks: Depth Hoar and Wind Slab. This algorithm was developed for a 24 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar. The novelty of our approach resides in the fact that no validation snow pits are required if previous data on snow conditions (snow depth and density) are known. The impact of the underlying ecotypes on the radar-derived snow stratigraphy was also investigated. The RMSE of the snow depth ranges from 3.5 to 25 cm, but mostly varies between 10 and 15 cm (< 25%). The RMSE is based on snow pit data that has a corresponding radar measurement.","Snow depth retrieval,Radar,Snow pit,Ecotype,Arctic snow,FMCW,"

"palaeomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy of carboniferous red beds from the maritime provinces of canada: evidence for shallow palaeomagnetic inclinations and implications for north american apparent polar wander","2010","A palaeomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy study was conducted on the lower-middle Carboniferous Maringouin and Shepody red bed formations of the Maritime Provinces of Canada to detect and correct inclination shallowing. Because of the shallow inclinations commonly observed in red beds and the strong dependence of North America's Palaeo-Mesozoic apparent polar wander (APW) on red beds, inclination shallowing may substantially affect large portions of North America's APW path. Hematite is the primary magnetic mineral carrier in these red beds, accompanied by secondary magnetite, maghemite, goethite and pigmentary hematite. Thermal and chemical demagnetization of the Shepody Fm. successfully isolated characteristic remanence directions of D= 177Â°, I= 20.4Â°, Î±95= 6.5Â°, N= 19 and D= 177.8Â°I= 17.7Â°, Î±95= 6.9Â°, N= 16, respectively. Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"
"simultaneous determination of four organotins in food packaging by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry","2015","A simple method based on high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of organotins—tri-n-butyltin chloride (TBT), triphenyltin chloride (TPT), dibutyltin dichloride (DBT), and diphenyltin dichloride (DPT)—in plastic food packaging. Samples were prepared by ultrasonic extraction with dichloromethane, followed by dissolution in acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, and purification by an MCX column. The extracts were analyzed by LC–MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring and positive modes with a C18 column; elution was carried out with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid. The limits of detection for TBT, TPT, DBT, and DPT were 0.1, 0.6, 0.8, and 0.3μgkg−1, respectively. The recovery of organotins in spiked samples ranged from 68% to 113% (relative standard deviation: 0.4–4.2%).

"maritime linked data for situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks","2021","Maritime heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN), which are widely used in support of marine monitoring, maritime security and safety applications, combine diversified sensing systems and platforms observing the state of environmental features of interest or the status of anthropogenic objects to achieve awareness on the situation. To model the information characteristics of HSN observations for maritime situational awareness (MSA), we developed the MSA-HSN ontology, an integrated semantic model for maritime linked data, specifically observations suiting the requirements of maritime information fusion systems. MSA-HSN integrates established ontologies and models for sensors, observations, measurements, quantities, and occurrents, tailored to MSA applications and requirements. To support the interoperability with existing maritime data models, MSA-HSN is aligned with the relevant aspects of the EUCISE/e-CISE (Common Information Sharing Environment) data models. As a validation use case, in this paper the MSA-HSN ontology is applied to model the information elements of the maritime surveillance system developed within the Interactive Extreme-Scale Analytics and Forecasting (INFORE) project, where different situational views offered by a variegate suite of sensors and platforms are fused using big data analytics to achieve maritime situational awareness for maritime security.

"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
"toward the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs for the maritime domain","2021","International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts, but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of, and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents.

"geochemistry and petrology of witwatersrand and dwyka diamictites from south africa: search for an extraterrestrial component","2001","Diamictites are poorly sorted sediments characteristically carrying coarse-grained clasts in a fine-grained matrix. They have generally been considered of glaciogenic or glaciomarine origin. Recently, however, it has been suggested that some massive tillite/diamictite layers could represent impact breccias. An earlier petrographic study of rock and mineral clasts from Dwyka Group diamictites revealed no evidence for shock metamorphism, such as planar deformation features. Detailed geochemical studies of diamictite samples from the Archean Witwatersrand Supergroup and the Dwyka Group of the Mesozoic Karoo Supergroup from South Africa are reported. We studied the contents of the siderophile elements in these breccias, as elevated abundances of such elements, especially iridium, could be indicative for an impact origin. By use of γ-γ coincidence spectrometry and other trace element analysis, geochemical tracers of extraterrestrial components were sought. However, no enrichments of indicator elements for extraterrestrial components, compared with ordinary continental crust, were found. Thus, neither geochemical nor petrographic evidence supports an impact origin of the diamictites from the Dwyka Group and the Witwatersrand Supergroup in South Africa.",""
"lake sediments from southern norway capture holocene variations in flood seasonality","2022","Owing to the combined impact of human encroachment and global climate change, river flood hazards have increased around the world. Over the past decades, rapid warming has augmented atmospheric moisture fluxes. The resulting intensification of the hydrological cycle, as evident from instrumental records, is linked to more frequent and severe flooding. However, this observational baseline is too short to adequately assess long-term flood variability under different climate conditions. Geological archives can fill this critical knowledge gap by providing long-term (millennia) empirical constraints on the magnitude and frequency of floods. To reconstruct the frequency of flood events over the last >8000 years, this study investigated the Holocene lacustrine sediments from Lake Lygne in southwestern Norway. The precipitation in this area is sourced from the North Atlantic Ocean and transported by the prevalent westerly winds. As such, reconstructions of flood frequency variability may shed light on past moisture flux and flood generating weather systems in this part of northwestern Europe. We applied a multiproxy approach to robustly fingerprint the flood sediment signatures using multiple independent lines of evidence. This approach included analysing the sediments using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), computed tomography (CT scanning), and magnetic susceptibility (MS). We identified two types of event beds that differed significantly from background sedimentation throughout the sedimentary archive, which we interpreted as river flood deposits: one type is minerogenic and coarse silt-dominated; the other is a composite of minerogenic sediments and macrofossils. By comparing the sediment record with instrumental water discharge data from the last 100 years, we argue that these differing flood signals represent two flood regimes: rainfall-triggered floods during autumn and snowmelt-triggered floods during spring. Conducting a rate of change (RoC) analysis, we found significant millennial- and centennial-scale variability in the frequency of flood events. Moreover, comparing our findings with palaeoclimate reconstructions in the North Atlantic region, we found that the warmer than present early-mid-Holocene was dominated by extreme precipitation-triggered floods, shifting towards more snowmelt-triggered floods in the late Holocene.","Floods,Lake sediments,North Atlantic,Palaeoclimatology,Holocene,"
"twelve years of geophysical research in the charlevoix seismic zone","1988","Various and extensive geophysical monitoring began in 1974 in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ). The historical record and a major earthquake in 1925 characterize this zone as the likely site of a future damaging earthquake (i.e. M = 5.5 or larger) and the aim of the monitoring was to develop the capability of predicting such earthquakes. The parameters studied included: microseismicity, seismic travel times, electrical impedance, vertical movement, horizontal movement, tilt, gravity change, and strain through water well level changes. Although no clear precursor was detected in the months before the largest seismic event that occurred during the observation period (M = 5.0), the multiparameter experiment provided new insights into the structure and the mechanics of this active region. Observations of several hundred well-located microearthquakes have permitted the delineation of ancient rift faults that are now being activated by high horizontal compression. The geographical extent of the zone is sharply defined by the microseismicity which occurs in an area of 35 km × 80 km straddling the St. Lawrence River. Observation of P-waves from accurately-timed explosions and S-waves from earthquakes support the hypothesis of Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy (EDA) involving saturated parallel cracks in the crust. The data have permitted an estimate of both crack density and the direction for the principal compressive stress in the region (N 30° E). Changes in electrical parameters with periods of months to years were detected at five of the six magnetotelluric stations installed in the region. Changes in the polarization angle of the earth's electrical (telluric) field correlated well (for seven years) with calculated groundwater accumulation levels at one site. Electric impedance changes showed no clear correlation from station to station, but changes at one station appear to correlate with a seismic P-wave travel time change anomaly and with the disappearance of a negative gravity anomaly at the time of an unusual number of earthquakes in the range M = 2 to 3 from mid 1976 to mid 1977. It is suggested that these correlated changes could be related to aseismic stress redistribution and fluid flow along one of the NE striking rift faults about two years before theM = 5.0 earthquake in 1979. Continuous monitoring of tilt (surface and borehole) and well-water levels was carried out at a single site (Charlevoix Geophysical Observatory). Although there were unexplained near-surface tilts of the order of the earth tide amplitude within two or three days before some earthquakes, they were either not spatially coherent or were related to small unexplained temperature changes in the tiltmeter vault. No intermediate-term (one week to one year) precursors were seen against a noise level of 1–3 μrad (RMS) for near-surface tilt observations and a noise level of 0.2–0.3 μrad (RMS) for borehole tilt measurements at a depth of 50–100 m. The threshold of detectable tidal tilt admittance changes for the borehole tiltmeters was lowered to 2% but no significant changes were seen. Four coseismic changes in the levels of water in boreholes were observed (all were drops in water level) which were much larger than expected on the basis of elastic dislocation theory. It is suggested that these could be explained either by the collapse of a dilatant zone around the respective hypocentres or by triggered aseisnuc movement on a nearby active fault. Borehole water level tides observed from 1980 to 1986 exhibit significant variations in amplitude and phase which are thought to be the result of time-varying elastic properties in a nearby structure. Some constraints can now be placed on the long-term deformation of the CSZ as a whole from tiltmeter, levelling and horizontal surveys. Data from a levelling array observed from 1976 to 1986 puts a limit of 0.54 μ rad/yr on the secular tilt rate at the observatory: a further limit of 0.1 μ rad/yr is provided by borehole tilt measurements over the period 1983–1986. A limit of 2 cm is placed on vertical movements northwest of the St. Lawrence River by levelling surveys in 1965, 1978, 1980 and 1982. No significant (90% confidence) deviatoric strain has been detected across the CSZ from horizontal control surveys carried out in 1912–1919, 1965, 1978 and 1983: the maximum allowable long-term strain rate across the CSZ from 1919 to 1983 is 0.16 μ strain/yr.",""
"variability of lightning activity in south/southeast asia during 1997–98 and 2002–03 el nino/la nina events","2012","Impacts of the 1997–98 and 2002–03 ENSOs on total number of flashes and number of flash days from the LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and on the average flash rate from the combined OTD (Optical Transient Detector) / LIS data are studied in South/Southeast Asia (8° –30°N, 60°–120°E) for the period 1998–2005. Also examined is the difference between the geographical distributions of these parameters in the El Nino period in 1998 and in the corresponding normal period in 1999. During the 1997–98 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 12% and 36%, respectively, during the El Nino period and during the La Nina period decrease by 22% and 5%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding normal periods. Similarly, during the 2002–2003 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 28% and 5% during the El Nino period in 2002 as compared to the corresponding normal period. The contrast in lightning activity between the El Nino and La Nina periods is more pronounced in Southeast Asia than in South Asia because of the southeastward shift in the convection activity during the ENSO events. In both regions, however, monthly variations of both total number of flashes and average flash rate are almost parallel to that of surface temperature. Although, the inverse relationship between the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and El Nino broke down in 1997–98, the relationship between the El Nino and lightning maintains its normal increasing trend, indicating that the lightning activity is more sensitive to the convective activity than to rainfall on seasonal time scale. The total number of flashes and aerosol loading increase in the break‐period regime as compared to the monsoonal regime. The number of flash days in both ENSO events is higher in the EL Nino phase and lower in the La Nina phase as compared to their normal values in the subsequent years.

"gipsyx/rtgx, a new tool set for space geodetic operations and research","2020","GipsyX/RTGx is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) next generation software package for positioning, navigation, timing, and Earth science using measurements from three geodetic techniques: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS); with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) under development. The software facilitates combined estimation of geodetic and geophysical parameters using a Kalman filter approach on real or simulated data in both post-processing and in real-time. The estimated parameters include station coordinates and velocities, satellite orbits and clocks, Earth orientation, ionospheric and tropospheric delays. The software is also capable of full realization of a dynamic terrestrial reference through analysis and combination of time series of ground station coordinates. Applying lessons learned from its predecessors, GIPSY-OASIS and Real Time GIPSY (RTG), GipsyX/RTGx was re-designed from the ground up to offer improved precision, accuracy, usability, and operational flexibility. We present some key aspects of its new architecture, and describe some of its major applications, including Real-time orbit determination and ephemeris predictions in the U.S. Air Force Next Generation GPS Operational Control Segment (OCX), as well as in JPL’s Global Differential GPS (GDGPS) System, supporting User Range Error (URE) of <5 cm RMS; precision post-processing GNSS orbit determination, including JPL’s contributions to the International GNSS Service (IGS) with URE in the 2 cm RMS range; Precise point positioning (PPP) with ambiguity resolution, both statically and kinematically, for geodetic applications with 2 mm horizontal, and 6.5 mm vertical repeatability for static positioning; Operational orbit and clock determination for Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites, such as NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission with GRACE relative clock alignment at the 20 ps level; calibration of radio occultation data from LEO satellites for weather forecasting and climate studies; Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) to GNSS and LEO satellites, DORIS-based and multi-technique orbit determination for LEO; production of terrestrial reference frames and Earth rotation parameters in support of JPL’s contribution to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).","Orbit determination and satellite clocks,Multi-technique space geodesy,GNSS,DORIS,SLR,Precise Point Positioning (PPP),"
"locating submerged prehistoric settlements: a new underwater survey method using water-jet coring and micro-geoarchaeological techniques","2021","In the past few decades the field of submerged prehistory has produced important data highlighting ancient coastal habitation across the globe. Most prehistoric underwater sites are discovered by chance (e.g., by industry, fishermen or recreational divers). New methods for detecting submerged prehistoric settlements have been developed using sophisticated remote sensing devices, yet with limited success. Simple, practical, and inexpensive methods for locating submerged settlements remain rare. Over 60 years of underwater archaeology and submerged prehistory in Israel, specifically along the Carmel coast, has led to a model for locating and studying submerged settlements, based on sand removal by storms. This study aimed to take this model a step further by developing a new, inexpensive method to identify, locate and characterize submerged sites. We collected undisturbed paleosol cores from exposed areas as well as under a few meters of sand, using a newly developed water-jet core sampling system. The cores were analyzed using micro-geoarchaeological techniques initially developed on terrestrial sites. The rationale behind this methodology is based on established knowledge that where human settlements occur, sediments are enriched by specific mineralogical signatures (e.g., heated clay minerals) and anthropogenic micro-remain assemblages (e.g., phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites). Additionally, micromorphology can assist in identifying micro-stratigraphic patterns typical of human settlements. We tested sediment cores in three underwater contexts: a) exposed prehistoric surfaces within two known Neolithic sites (Atlit-Yam and Neve Yam), b) exposed paleosols without visible archaeological remains (serving as a control), and c) as a blind test, a buried paleosol currently covered by 1–3 m of sand, where the existence of a site is unknown. In the cores taken from the exposed Neolithic settlements, the micro-geoarchaeological characterization showed clear anthropogenic signals (typical mineralogy, elevated micro-remain concentrations, micro-stratigraphy). In the paleosol control cores, there was an absence (or negligible presence) of anthropogenic signals. The ‘blind test’ at the sand-covered locality revealed sediments without anthropogenic enrichments (similar to the control paleosols), thus suggesting the absence of a submerged settlement in this specific location. The new method is time- and cost-effective and can easily be applied worldwide along the shallow continental shelf as well as in deep water. The new method will facilitate discovery of new underwater sites and provide selection criteria (e.g., where the highest anthropogenic signal exists) for investment in underwater excavations. Additionally, it can be used to check for anthropogenic signals in buried locations detected by remote sensing, and to understand the spatial organization of submerged sites.","Manual coring,Neolithic Carmel coast,Micro-geoarchaeology,Submerged prehistory,Underwater archaeology,Water-jet coring,"
"multiple oceanographic hf surface-wave radars applied to maritime surveillance","2014","In the context of maritime surveillance, low-power high-frequency surface-wave (HFSW) radars are attracting significant attention as cost-effective tools for long-range ship detection and tracking applications. In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to live-recorded data from a network of three oceanographic HFSW radars installed on the coast of the German Bight, in the North Sea. This campaign follows a previous one conducted in 2009, in which two HFSW radars were deployed on the coast of the Ligurian Sea, in the Mediterranean. Ship reports from the automatic identification system, recorded from a number of coastal stations, are exploited as ground truth information. A methodology is then applied to classify the fused tracks and to estimate single-sensor and data fusion performances. Both in situ and model data are used to investigate the capabilities of the systems according to the variations of the meteorological and oceanographic conditions.

Interactive visual analysis serves as an efficient complementary approach for the detection of various phenomena or patterns, and correlation exploring or comparing multiple variables in researchers daily work. Firstly, this paper presents a basic concept of the ocean data produced from numerous measurement devices or computer simulations. The characteristics of ocean data and the related data processing techniques are also described. Secondly, the main tasks of ocean data analysis are introduced. Based on the main analysis tasks in the field of oceanography, the survey emphasizes related interactive visualization techniques and tools from four aspects: visualization of multiple ocean environmental elements and multivariate analysis, ocean phenomena identification and tracking, patterns or correlation discovery, ensembles and uncertainties exploration.

"mid-cretaceous sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary cyclicity in the western paris basin","1992","Cenomanian and Turonian depositional patterns of the western Paris Basin are interpreted in terms of sequence stratigraphy. A system tract analysis of the epicontinental “Normandie Basin”, with pelagic chalks, and of the “Maine Platform” covered by clastics, provides evidence for relative changes in coastal onlap; various minor uncomformities are related to these changes of sea level. The four global cycles (UZA or ZC-2.2/2.5) of Haq et al. (1987, 1988) are recognised while an additional one is proposed for the Geslinianum Zone. In addition, periodic rhythmic cycles are commonly registered within the chalk, expressed by the repitition of various facies enhanced both by biosedimentary processes and diagenetic alteration. These elementary climatic cycles allow accurate lithostratigraphic correlations. During this period when the sea level peaked on the tectonically passive border of the Armorican block, the Paris Basin appears to record a detailed set of events which can be correlated with those in the Atlantic, Boreal and Tethyan provinces.

"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"

"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"remote sensing satellite technology to determine the center of the maritime defense logistics route for securing the indonesian capital city (ikn)","2022","Displacement of the capital of Indonesia has been provided for in Law Number 3 of 2022, namely the IKN Nusantara which is one of the centers of gravity or the center of national strategic strength so that security for the area is very much needed. In order to secure the IKN from all possible enemy attacks, a military defense base is needed that functions as a Logistics support center to support all military operations. The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines.

"magnetic detection of archaeological hearths in alaska: a tool for investigating the full span of human presence at the gateway to north america","2019","Magnetic survey methods have recently shown tremendous potential for the detection of archaeological hearths in Eastern Beringia, ranging from intermittent open-air camp fires to larger heat intensive activity areas. Here we present an overview of the method along with eight supporting case studies from seven U.S. National Park Service units in the U.S. state of Alaska, covering diverse geographic settings and time-periods. Together, these case studies demonstrate the capabilities of magnetic detection instruments in various modes of operation for finding datable archaeological deposits that span the breadth of known human occupation of this region. The examples range from the simplest use of the magnetometer as a single sensor reconnaissance instrument in a “search mode”, to use as a gradiometer in conjunction with other geophysical methods such as ground-penetrating radar, to record precise measurements and inform nuanced interpretations. Examples presented here range from the terminal Pleistocene to historic periods, spanning 12,000 years of human activity in Eastern Beringia, and encompassing the arrival, emergence, and expansion of multiple human groups or cultural traditions in the New World.","Arctic,Pleistocene,Denbigh,Bering land bridge,Magnetometer,Hearth,Arctic small tool,Paleoarctic,Northern Archaic,Thule,Ocean Bay,Alaska,Inupiat,Beringia,Birnirk,Norton,"
"annual ice volume changes 1976–2008 for the new zealand southern alps","2012","New Zealand has a long, continuous record of annual end-of-summer-snowline measurements for a set of Southern Alps ‘index glaciers’ from 1977 to present. These index glaciers are used to estimate annual mass balance and volume water equivalent changes for the over 3000 glaciers on the Southern Alps. Two methods are employed to monitor ice volume changes. Method I deals with the rapid to normal response time glaciers, which tend to be small to medium in size. It uses mass balance gradients and glacier areas to convert changes in snowlines to changes in ice volume water equivalent. Ice volume changes for the period 1976–2008 are calculated for each index glacier, and then extrapolated to most other glaciers of the Southern Alps, using the New Zealand glacier inventory. Method II deals with 12 protracted response glaciers, which tend to be large in size. These have been slow in reacting to a long-term regional warming trend. Instead they still largely retain the ablation areas of a century ago and are in a state of disequilibrium with the present climate. These valley glaciers have recently sustained substantial ice losses that are not able to be detected using Method I. Mass balance deficits and ablation from the 12 large protracted response glaciers are estimated using a geodetic approach based on topographic and lake changes determined from repeated surveys. Results show that estimated ice volume (in water equivalents) for the Southern Alps has decreased from 54.5km3 in 1976 to 46.1km3 by 2008. This equates to a rate of −0.3km3a−1 over the last three decades, but this is considerably less than the rate of ice volume loss estimated for the previous 100years. More than 3000 small and medium-size glaciers account for just 29% of the overall ice volume loss from the Southern Alps, while 71% of the loss occurs from the 12 large protracted response glaciers. Terminus calving contributes 0.8km3 and down-wasting of ice tongues in the ablation zone contributes 5.2km3. Some preliminary results show that ice volume changes are related to changes in circulation over the New Zealand region.","End-of-summer snowline,Ice volume,Glacier mass balance,Proglacial lake,Climate connections,ELA,"
"what is going on within google earth engine? a systematic review and meta-analysis","2023","Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a geospatial processing platform based on geo-information applications in the ‘cloud’. This platform provides free access to huge volumes of satellite data for computing, and offers support tools to monitor and analyse environmental features on a large scale. Such facilities have been widely used in numerous studies about land management and planning. Considering the current lack of relevant overviews, it may be useful to evaluate the utilization paths of GEE and its impact on the scientific community. For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted using the PRISMA methodology based on 343 articles published from 2020 to 2022 in high-impact scientific journals, selected from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After an overview of the publishing context, an analysis of the frequency of satellite features, processing methods, applications are carried out, and a special attention is given to the COVID-19 studies. Finally, the geographical distribution of the reviewed articles is evaluated, and the citation impact metrics is analysed. On a bibliometric approach, 90 journals published articles on GEE in the reference period (January 2020 to April 2022), and this large number of journals reveals the multidisciplinary application of GEE platform as well as the interest of publishers towards this topic of relevance for the international scientific community. The results of the meta-analysis following the systematic review showed that: (i) the Landsat 8 was the most widely-used satellite (25%); (i) the non-parametric classification methods, mainly Random Forest, were the most recurrent algorithms (31%); and (iii) the water resources assessment and prediction were the most common methodological applications (22%). A low number of articles about COVID-19, in spite of the planetary importance of the pandemic effects. The reviewed articles were geographically distributed among 86 countries, China, United States, and India accounting for the large number. ‘Remote Sensing’ and ‘Remote Sensing of Environment’ were the leading journals in the citation impact metrics, while the Random Forest method and the agriculture-related applications being the mostly cited. It is expected that these results might change over the mid to long term, due to fast progress in environmental and spatial information technologies, although currently our findings may be worthwhile and useful for assessing the current global deployment of GEE platform.","Geo-big data,Cloud computing,Remote sensing,Global monitoring,Environmental spatial analysis,"
"satellite radar altimetry water elevations performance over a 200m wide river: evaluation over the garonne river","2017","For at least 20 years, nadir altimetry satellite missions have been successfully used to first monitor the surface elevation of oceans and, shortly after, of large rivers and lakes. For the last 5–10 years, few studies have demonstrated the possibility to also observe smaller water bodies than previously thought feasible (river smaller than 500m wide and lake below 10km2). The present study aims at quantifying the nadir altimetry performance over a medium river (200m or lower wide) with a pluvio-nival regime in a temperate climate (the Garonne River, France). Three altimetry missions have been considered: ENVISAT (from 2002 to 2010), Jason-2 (from 2008 to 2014) and SARAL (from 2013 to 2014). Compared to nearby in situ gages, ENVISAT and Jason-2 observations over the lower Garonne River mainstream (110 km upstream of the estuary) have the smallest errors, with water elevation anomalies root mean square errors (RMSE) around 50cm and 20cm, respectively. The few ENVISAT upstream measurements have RMSE ranging from 80cm to 160cm. Over the estuary, ENVISAT and SARAL water elevation anomalies RMSE are around 30cm and 10cm, respectively. The most recent altimetry mission, SARAL, does not provide river elevation measurements for most satellite overflights of the river mainstream. The altimeter remains “locked” on the top of surrounding hilly areas and does not observe the steep-sided river valley, which could be 50–100m lower. This phenomenon is also observed, for fewer dates, on Jason-2 and ENVISAT measurements. In these cases, the measurement is not “erroneous”, it just does not correspond to water elevation of the river that is covered by the satellite. ENVISAT is less prone to get ‘locked’ on the top of the topography due to some differences in the instrument measurement parameters, trading lower accuracy for more useful measurements. Such problems are specific to continental surfaces (or near the coasts), but are not observed over the open oceans, which are flatter. To overcome this issue, an experimental instrument operating mode, called the DIODE/DEM tracking mode, has been developed by CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) and has been tested during few Jason-2 cycles and during the first SARAL/AltiKA cycle. This tracking mode “forces” the instrument to observe a target of interest, i.e. water bodies. The example of the Garonne River shows, for one SARAL ground track, the benefit of the DIODE/DEM tracking mode for a steep-sided river reach, which is not detected using the nominal instrument operating mode. Yet, this mode relies on ancillary datasets (a priori global DEM and global land/water mask), which are critical to obtain river valley observation. The ultimately computed elevations along the satellite tracks, loaded on board, should have an absolute vertical accuracy around 10m (or better). This case also shows, when the instrument is correctly observing the river valley, that the altimeter can detect water bodies narrower than 100m (like an artificial canal). In agreement with recent studies, this work shows that altimeter missions can provide useful water elevation measurements over a 200m wide river with RMSE as low as 50cm and 20cm, for ENVISAT and Jason-2 respectively. The seasonal cycle can be observed with the temporal sampling of these missions (35 days and 10 days, respectively), but short term events, like flood events, are most of the time not observed. It also illustrates that altimeter capability to observe a river is highly dependent of the surrounding topography, the observation configuration, previous measurements and the instrument design. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize at global scale the minimum river width that could be seen by altimeters. This study analyzes, for the first time, the potential of the experimental DIODE/DEM tracking mode to observe steep-sided narrow river valleys, which are frequently missed with nominal tracking mode. For such case, using the DIODE/DEM mode could provide water elevation measurements, as long as the on board DEM is accurate enough. This mode should provide many more valid measurements over steep-sided rivers than currently observed.","SARAL,Garonne River,DIODE/DEM mode,Satellite altimetry,ENVISAT,Jason-2,"

"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""
"dem analyses and morphotectonic interpretation: the plio-quaternary evolution of the eastern ligurian alps, italy","2012","The Ligurian Alps (Italy) straddle a complex and ill-defined tectonic transition that accommodates Eurasia–Adria shortening driving concurrent growth of the western Alps and northern Apennines. We focus on the Plio-Quaternary landscape evolution of the eastern part of the Ligurian Alps with the goal of defining the active tectonics through an analysis of topography, drainage networks, and river long profiles. The Ligurian Alps have a steep, seaward-facing escarpment with topographic features reminiscent of the geomorphic markers preserved on both actively-uplifting coastlines and passive margins. For example, there are seaward-facing benches that are thought to be uplifted marine terraces common to active margins; but the drainage divide of the seaward escarpment shows clear evidence of recent northward migration into the Po foreland, a process consistent with escarpment retreat characteristic of passive or subsiding margins. This study explores the active tectonics consistent with these diverse landscape evolution pathways. Our analysis reveals that rock-type strongly throttles the development of topographic relief, drainage networks, and northward migration of the drainage divide. However, we also identify segments of the escarpment that indicate recent base level falls through an analysis of modeled channel steepness and comparison with mean hillslope gradient. The base level falls are consistent with numerous barbed tributaries that are best explained as recent stream captures. No significant correlation among the stream captures at the drainage divide, suspected marine terraces at the coast, Ligurian Sea bathymetry, and active seismicity indicates that the escarpment is the footwall of a segmented normal fault. This normal fault is embedded in a regionally subsiding margin where actively uplifting segments lead to a straightened, pinned drainage divide, whereas, relatively inactive segments permit divide migration into the footwall block. These results are broadly consistent with rock uplift increasing eastward toward Genova across the long-suspected Alps–Apennine Sestri–Voltaggio fault zone. They highlight the respective roles of legacy structures, rock-type, and localized rock uplift in constructing a landscape in an otherwise extending and subsiding crustal retrowedge of an active subduction plate boundary.","Tectonic geomorphology,DEM analysis,Ligurian Alps,River longitudinal profile,"
"multi-scale collision risk estimation for maritime traffic in complex port waters","2023","Ship collision risk estimation is an essential component of intelligent maritime surveillance systems. Traditional risk estimation approaches, which can only analyze traffic risk in one specific scale, reveal a significant challenge in quantifying the collision risk of a traffic scenario from different spatial scales. This is detrimental to understanding the traffic situations and supporting effective anti-collision decision-making, particularly as maritime traffic complexity grows and autonomous ships emerge. In this study, a systematic multi-scale collision risk estimation approach is newly developed to capture traffic conflict patterns under different spatial scales. It extends the application of the complex network theory and a node deletion method to quantify the interactions and dependencies among multiple ships within encounter scenarios, enabling collision risk to be evaluated at any spatial scale. Meanwhile, an advanced graph-based clustering framework is introduced to search for the optimal spatial scales for risk evaluation. Extensive numerical experiments based on AIS data in Ningbo_Zhoushan Port are implemented to evaluate the model performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can strengthen maritime situational awareness, identify high-risk areas and support strategic maritime safety management. This work therefore sheds light on improving the intelligent levels of maritime surveillance and promoting maritime traffic automation.","Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Multi-scale collision risk,Graph clustering,Network theory,"
"hybrid electrochemical sensor platform for capsaicin determination using coarsely stepped cyclic squarewave voltammetry","2019","A small, standalone electrochemical hybrid sensor platform, combining flexible electronics and screen-printed electrodes, is demonstrated in the determination of capsaicin through adsorptive stripping voltammetry. The sensing scheme was simplified to be compatible with a low-cost device. The simplification involved eliminating the need for additional modification of the electrode and employing a coarsely stepped squarewave voltammetry, a technique which is applicable with less sophisticated instrumentation. This architecture was found to be suitable for concentrations up to at least 5000 µM with a detection limit of 1.98 µM. The screen-printed carbon graphite electrodes were made reusable through an ethanol rinsing protocol. The effect of ethanol/buffer volumetric ratio in the test sample was shown to ﻿greatly influence the analytical data, and a fixed 10% (v/v) was chosen as a compromise between signal-to-noise ratio and not exceeding the solubility limit of the desired upper range.","Hybrid electronics,Screen-printed electrodes,Capsaicin,Electrochemical biosensors,Chili hotness,"
"context-aware dynamic asset allocation for maritime interdiction operations","2020","This paper validates two approximate dynamic programming approaches on a maritime interdiction problem involving the allocation of multiple heterogeneous assets over a large area of responsibility to interdict multiple drug smugglers using heterogeneous types of transportation on the sea with varying contraband weights.

We validate the proposed architectural and algorithmic concepts via several realistic mission scenarios. We conduct sensitivity analyses to quantify the robustness and proactivity of our approach, as well as to measure the value of information used in the allocation process.

"relations between climate change and mass movement: perspectives from the canadian cordillera and the european alps","2021","Earth's climate is warming and will continue to warm as the century progresses. High mountains and high latitudes are experiencing the greatest warming of all regions on Earth and also are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, in part because ecosystems and natural processes in these areas are intimately linked to the cryosphere. Evidence is mounting that warming will further reduce permafrost and snow and ice cover in high mountains, which in turn will destabilize many slopes, alter sediment delivery to streams, and change subalpine and alpine ecosystems. This paper contributes to the continuing discussion of impacts of climate change on mountain environments by comparing and discussing processes and trends in the mountains of western Canada and the European Alps. We highlight the effects of physiography and climate on physical processes occurring in the two regions. Processes of interest include landslides and debris flows induced by glacier debuttressing, alpine permafrost thaw, changes in rainfall regime, formation and sudden drainage of glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes, ice avalanches, glacier surges, and large-scale sediment transfers due to rapid deglacierization. Our analysis points out the value of integrating observations and data from different areas of the world to better understand these processes and their impacts.","Cryosphere,Mass movement,European Alps,Canadian Cordillera,Climate change,"
"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"
"a strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","2012","Derelict fishing gear (DFG) is a highly persistent form of marine pollution known to cause environmental and economic damage. At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","Remote sensing,Marine debris,Derelict fishing gear,"
"interregional trade at hala sultan tekke, cyprus: analysis and chronology of imports","2023","This paper presents the results from extensive and intensive field work at Hala Sultan Tekke, Cyprus, supported by scientific analyses.

Although the results from older excavations suggested the city’s engagement in interregional trade, these preliminary conclusions were based on chronologically and geographically restricted material and only a few scientific analyses, which have since been complemented and partly revised. It is now clear that long-distance exchange, based on the large-scale intra-urban production and distribution of copper, involved regional and more distant suppliers of coveted goods, and resulted in the transition of the settlement from a late 17th century B.C. village to a trade hub with a minimum extent of 25 ha.","Sardinia,Mycenae,Crete,Mesopotamia,Levant,Cyprus,Fauna,Georadar,Fish remains,Late Bronze Age,Copper production,FTIR,Magnetometers,Egypt,NAA,Interregional trade,Petrography,"
"triton: high-speed maritime wireless mesh network","2013","This article presents the TRI-media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) project, which aims to develop a high-speed and low-cost maritime communication system. The article includes information pertaining to background studies, high-level architecture, network feasibility, maritime communication environment, technology developments, prototype implementations and link performance measurements. The motivation for this project stems from the fact that there is an increasing need for low-cost and high-speed maritime communication, with demands mainly coming from regulatory and crew welfare needs. The system described in this article is a wireless mesh network based on the IEEE 802.16. An analysis of the node connectivity based on real ship traffic data shows that the network is feasible in shipping lanes with a high density of ships. The system also considers the use of an intelligent middleware to allow communications to switch back to a satellite link in cases where neighboring ships are sparse or at locations far away from mesh base stations. Protocol enhancements to both the Medium Access Control (MAC) and networking layers and a hardware design that features multiple transceivers and the implementation of antenna switching to counter sea wave reflection and rocking problems are presented.

"life history of an anticyclonic eddy in the algerian basin from altimetry data, tracking algorithm and in situ observations.","2020","Frequently-forming long-life mesoscale eddies are observed in the Algerian Basin that influence the circulation of the wider Western Mediterranean Sea. Most of these structures store and transport water masses including associated physical and biological properties throughout the entire basin. In order to study the evolution of a long-life anticyclonic eddy, we use a multiplatform approach based on remote sensing data analysis and in situ measurements. We present a case study of an anticyclonic eddy that persisted for 17 months within the basin. The feature was identified through a hybrid method of eddy detection and tracking applied to altimetry data, and sampled twice during two different oceanographic cruises in autumn 2004 and late spring 2005. Transect observations of potential temperature, salinity, density and the dissolved oxygen concentration were utilised to infer water mass properties and eddy characteristics. In situ data show that water of Atlantic origin, initially trapped by the eddy during its formation, was modified during the eddy lifetime. The time evolution of radius, kinetic energy and vorticity suggests dividing the eddy lifetime into three phases: the eddy formation, an intermediate period of high variability and a final, lower energy phase. The track followed by the eddy confirms the hypothesis of an interaction with the North Balearic Front and a consequent change of the eddy's physical properties. Decomposing the eddy's kinetic energy into mean and fluctuating terms allows us to describe its interaction with the mean circulation of the basin. In particular during formation, the southern part of the eddy absorbs energy from the mean circulation, while it provides energy to the mean flow in its northern part. In the second phase, when the eddy is far from the coast, it receives energy from the mean flow. Combining in situ data analysis with the results of the satellite-imagery-based detection and tracking method has proven to be a very useful method in assessing the evolution of a mesoscale structure in the Algerian Basin and its interaction with the large scale ocean dynamics of the Western Mediterranean Sea.",""
"the geochemistry of gem opals as evidence of their origin","2008","Seventy-seven gem opals from ten countries were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) through a dilution process, in order to establish the nature of the impurities. The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (Ba>110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Ba<110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, and to a lesser extent that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to common opals, indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to “chocolate brown”). This element inhibits luminescence for concentrations above 1000 ppm, whereas already a low content in U (≤1 ppm) induces a green luminescence.","Opal,Trace element analysis,Chemical composition,Genesis,ICP-MS,"

"temporal-spatio evolution of maritime accidents","2023","As an important passage connecting China with Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East, the South China Sea has an important geopolitical and economic strategic position.

The resulting directed graph ultimately leads to the detection and statistical characterization of recurrent maritime traffic patterns.

"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally.

"detection of signals linked to climate change, land-cover change and climate oscillators in tropical montane cloud forests","2021","Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) form biodiverse communities that are characterized by frequent occurrence of low-level clouds from which they capture a substantial proportion of their precipitation — here referred to as occult precipitation. TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 106 km2 ± 0.5 × 106 km2). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.","IOD,ENSO,TRMM,Tropical Montane Cloud Forests,Reanalysis,MODIS,Climate change,Cloud-base height,"
"building defect detection: external versus internal thermography","2016","Many buildings suffer from defects in the building envelope, such as missing insulation, thermal bridging, cracks and moisture problems. Thermography is one technology that can help to identify such defects. However, there are different approaches towards assessing the building envelope. Pass-by thermography is an emerging method, which is used to capture single thermal images of external building elevations. Compared with traditional walk-through thermography, it is much quicker and cheaper to perform. Yet it is currently unclear how successful this methodology is at detecting building defects. This paper qualitatively compares pass-by thermography and walk-through thermography. A set of 122 residential dwellings in South West England was inspected using the both methodologies. Results show that substantially more defects were detected using walk-through thermography, with internal inspections yielding the greatest number of detected defects. Significant constraints with walk-past thermography were identified, such as unknown occupancy behaviour, transient climatic conditions, fixed viewing angles and spatial resolution limitations, which were all found to have a greater impact on image results than during walk-through thermography. Although trends in conductivity defects were found from target comparison analysis between similar dwellings, viewing single external elevations under walk-past thermography was found to miss many different defect types, which would have normally been discovered during traditional walk-through thermography.","Defect detection,Walk-past,Thermography,Walk-through,"
"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"
"variability and propagation of labrador sea water in the southern subpolar north atlantic","2009","The variability of two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) (upper and deep Labrador Sea Water) and their respective spreading in the interior North Atlantic Ocean are investigated by means of repeated ship surveys carried out along the zonal WOCE line A2/AR19 located at 43–48°N (1993–2007) and along the GOOS line at about 48–51°N (1997–2002). Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC. It acts as an important supplier for the interior North Atlantic, distributing older and recently formed LSW modes southward along the MAR.","Water mass spreading,Subpolar North Atlantic,Mid-Atlantic Ridge,Ocean circulation,Labrador Sea Water,"
"response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across croatian biogeographic regions inferred from fapar remote sensing data","2014","Croatia is positioned in the transitional zone of South-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, a region with frequent occurrence of severe droughts and dry spells, which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events.

In this work, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are applied to live-recorded data from a network of oceanographic HFSW radars installed in the German Bight (North Sea). This experimentation closely follows the one conducted in the Ligurian Sea (Mediterranean Sea) by NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) during the Battlespace Preparation 2009 (BP09) campaign. Ship reports from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), recorded from both coastal and satellite-based stations, are exploited as ground truth information and a methodology is applied to classify the fused tracks and to estimate system performances.

"integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ert and limited drillings at the hepu han tombs, in coastal area of southern china","2019","The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds. The results have shown a general consistency between the geophysical work and traditional archaeological drilling explorations, improving our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allowing detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.","Burial mounds,Hepu Han Tombs,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),Drillings,"
"building resilience through foresight: the case of maritime container shipping firms","2022","Maritime container shipping (MCS) firms represent the backbone of worldwide supply chains. Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firmsâ€™ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firmsâ€™ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario â€œpicking the low-hanging fruit,â€ other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario â€œexperiencing an era of dichotomy.â€ In the long-term scenario â€œovercoming the obstacles of the generational shift,â€ MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the expertsâ€™ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.","Pandemics,freight transportation,maritime,Uncertainty,scenarios,technology foresight,Delphi,Containers,COVID-19,judgmental forecasting,Bibliographies,Industries,Planning,Supply chains,"
"chapter 2 fasciola, lymnaeids and human fascioliasis, with a global overview on disease transmission, epidemiology, evolutionary genetics, molecular epidemiology and control","2009","Fascioliasis, caused by liver fluke species of the genus Fasciola, has always been well recognized because of its high veterinary impact but it has been among the most neglected diseases for decades with regard to human infection. However, the increasing importance of human fascioliasis worldwide has re‐launched interest in fascioliasis. From the 1990s, many new concepts have been developed regarding human fascioliasis and these have furnished a new baseline for the human disease that is very different to a simple extrapolation from fascioliasis in livestock. Studies have shown that human fascioliasis presents marked heterogeneity, including different epidemiological situations and transmission patterns in different endemic areas. This heterogeneity, added to the present emergence/re‐emergence of the disease both in humans and animals in many regions, confirms a worrying global scenario. The huge negative impact of fascioliasis on human communities demands rapid action. When analyzing how better to define control measures for endemic areas differing at such a level, it would be useful to have genetic markers that could distinguish each type of transmission pattern and epidemiological situation. Accordingly, this chapter covers aspects of aetiology, geographical distribution, epidemiology, transmission and control in order to obtain a solid baseline for the interpretation of future results. The origins and geographical spread of F. hepatica and F. gigantica in both the ruminant pre‐domestication times and the livestock post‐domestication period are analyzed. Paleontological, archaeological and historical records, as well as genetic data on recent dispersal of livestock species, are taken into account to establish an evolutionary framework for the two fasciolids across all continents. Emphasis is given to the distributional overlap of both species and the roles of transportation, transhumance and trade in the different overlap situations. Areas with only one Fasciola spp. are distinguished from local and zonal overlaps in areas where both fasciolids co‐exist. Genetic techniques applied to liver flukes in recent years that are useful to elucidate the genetic characteristics of the two fasciolids are reviewed. The intra‐specific and inter‐specific variabilities of ‘pure’ F. hepatica and ‘pure’ F. gigantica were ascertained by means of complete sequences of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS)‐2 and ITS‐1 and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) cox1 and nad1 from areas with only one fasciolid species. Fasciolid sequences of the same markers scattered in the literature are reviewed. The definitive haplotypes established appear to fit the proposed global evolutionary scenario. Problems posed by fasciolid cross‐breeding, introgression and hybridization in overlap areas are analyzed. Nuclear rDNA appears to correlate with adult fluke characteristics and fasciolid/lymnaeid specificity, whereas mtDNA does not. However, flukes sometimes appear so intermediate that they cannot be ascribed to either F. hepatica‐like or F. gigantica‐like forms and snail specificity may be opposite to the one deduced from the adult morphotype. The phenotypic characteristics of adults and eggs of ‘pure’ F. hepatica and F. gigantica, as well as of intermediate forms in overlap areas, are compared, with emphasis on the definitive host influence on egg size in humans. Knowledge is sufficient to support F. hepatica and F. gigantica as two valid species, which recently diverged by adaptation to different pecoran and lymnaeid hosts in areas with differing environmental characteristics. Their phenotypic differences and ancient pre‐domestication origins involve a broad geographical area that largely exceeds the typical, more local scenarios known for sub‐species units. Phenomena such as abnormal ploidy and aspermic parthenogenesis in hybrids suggest that their separate evolution in pre‐domestication times allowed them to achieve almost total genetic isolation. Recent sequencing results suggest that present assumptions on fasciolid‐lymnaeid specificity might be wrong. The crucial role of lymnaeids in fascioliasis transmission, epidemiology and control was the reason for launching a worldwide lymnaeid molecular characterization initiative. This initiative has already furnished useful results on several continents. A standardized methodology for fasciolids and lymnaeids is proposed herein in order that future work is undertaken on a comparable basis. A complete understanding of molecular epidemiology is expected to help greatly in designing global actions and local interventions for control of fascioliasis.",""

"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%. With the proposed computational framework, AIS data can be utilized for maritime predictions, supporting more complex marine applications and covering more expansive geographic areas.","Vessel trajectory prediction,Automatic Identification System,Vessel origin–destination analysis,Vessel destination prediction,"

"resilience assessment of maritime container shipping networks â€“ a case of the maritime silk road","2019","This paper presents a framework for the resilience assessment of maritime shipping networks by quantifying its recovery performance under natural hazards. The vulnerability of the maritime shipping network is measured according to the variation of network efficiency and the relative size of the largest connected subgraph in the face of the disruption of transportation systems (shutdown of ports). The service performance of the maritime shipping network is indicated by the global network efficiency, and the resilience of maritime shipping network is associated to the network performance loss triangle considering the whole process from a partial disruption to full recovery. The proposed resilience assessment method is applied to a container shipping network of the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) under the storm risks. Two recovery strategies, which are random recovery strategy and multi-centrality based recovery strategy, are adopted respectively, and the recovery performance of the container shipping network under different strategies are comparatively analyzed. The research results can be used to not only support the identification of the weak points of the maritime transportation network along the MSR through vulnerability analysis but also provide a reference for the effective risk management of maritime transportation, so as to improve the safety and reliability of the whole system.","Transportation,Risk management,storm risks,Safety,transportation,Resilience,subgraph,maritime container shipping networks,maritime risk,ships,Containers,marine safety,natural hazards,risk management,storms,maritime transportation network,sea ports,graph theory,network performance loss triangle,global network efficiency,maritime shipping network,Indexes,resilience assessment,Container shipping network,hazards,multi-centrality,Loss measurement,transportation resilience,multicentrality based recovery strategy,transportation systems,random recovery strategy,maritime silk road,"
"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"
"an overview of cawses-india program with emphasis to equatorial atmospheric coupling processes","2012","This paper presents an overview of CAWSES—India program, highlighting some of the Indian coordinated efforts to understand the Sun−Earth system as a whole, with special emphasis to the equatorial and low latitude phenomena. Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"

In order to standardize and simplify generation of Bayesian Identification Networks for new operational scenarios, a generic Bayesian Network for identification is proposed. This generic model defines adequate and necessary node types, well suited for modeling of identification and assessment tasks. In addition, the model provides a dependency structure by subgraphs, which simplifies provision of more complex cause-effect relations in Bayesian Identification Networks. Nevertheless, the generic model is flexible enough to cover various application scenarios with manifold operational demands.

"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability. In this paper a methodology based on the perturbation analysis developed by the authors is presented. The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences. Moreover, a map of the buoys helped locating this typology of targets. The results showed impressive accuracy, with detection of all the vessels seen during the ground truth.","Clutter,Classification algorithms,Vectors,Scattering,Marine vehicles,Detectors,Feature extraction,"
"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","Underwater glider,Variational autoencoder,Marine autonomous system,Anomaly detection,Long short-term memory network,"
"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"
"mesoscale modeling of smoke transport over the southeast asian maritime continent: interplay of sea breeze, trade wind, typhoon, and topography","2013","The online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRFchem) is used to simulate the transport of smoke particles over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent during September–October 2006. In this period, dry conditions associated with the moderate El Niño event caused the largest regional biomass burning outbreak since 1997. Smoke emission in WRFchem is specified according to the Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) database derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. The modeled smoke transport pathway is found to be consistent with the MODIS true color images and measured mass concentration of surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10μm). The interplay of sea/land breezes, typhoons and storms over the subtropical western Pacific Ocean, trade winds, and topographic effects, can be clearly seen in the model simulation. The most severe smoke events in 1–5 October 2006 are found to be associated with the meteorological responses to the typhoon Xangsane (#18) over the western subtropical Pacific Ocean, which moved smoke from Sumatra eastward in the lower troposphere (below 700hPa), forming smoke layers mixed with and above the boundary layer clouds over Borneo. In contrast, the second largest week-long smoke transport event of 15–18 October 2006 was associated with the seasonal monsoonal transition period, during which smoke plumes were wide spread over the 5°S–5°N zone as a result of (a) the near surface divergence coupled with the 700hPa bifurcation of wind (flowing both to the west and to the east), and (b) the near-surface southeasterly and easterly winds along the equator transporting smoke from Borneo to Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Analysis of data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) shows that smoke particles in October 2006 were primarily located within 3.5km above the surface. Smoke particles contributed roughly half of the total aerosol extinction retrieved by CALIOP. Results suggest that the smoke injection height in the model should be set lower than the 2–5km commonly used in transport simulations; smoke release at ~0.8km instead of 2km above surface gives a consistently better match to CALIOP observations. Numerical experiments further show that the Titiwangsa Mountains in Malaysia Peninsula and Tama Abu Mountains in Borneo have significant impacts on smoke transport and the surface air quality in the vicinity.","Sea breeze,Trade wind,Typhoon,Southeast Asian Maritime Continent,Smoke particles,"
"fault diagnosis of regenerative thermal oxidizer system via dynamic uncertain causality graph integrated with early anomaly detection","2023","Regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTO) serve as pivotal equipment for the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, a diversity of faults of the RTO system may threaten personnel safety and lead to unscheduled downtime. In this work, we develop a traceability inference method based on dynamic uncertain causality graph (DUCG) to identify root fault cause of RTO at early anomaly alarm. A general expert knowledge base for the fault diagnosis of RTO system is constructed. And the anomaly alarm thresholds are modified according to historical data with n-sigma rules to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Results on different cases show advantages in both triggering early anomaly alarms and avoiding invalid alarms, which is crucial to improve the fault inference accuracy. By applying our method to 35 fault cases of a real RTO for pharmaceutical VOCs treatment, the fault detection rate reaches 94.29%, and the fault inference accuracy is 82.86%. The two scores are 3% and 21% higher than those with the conventional DUCG (with fixed alarms), respectively. This remarkable improvement underlines the significance of our proposed method for RTO maintenance, and it is expected to assure the system’s operational stability and reliability.","Anomaly detection,Regenerative thermal oxidizer,Dynamic uncertain causality graph,Fault diagnosis,"
"deployment strategies of mobile networks for internet-of-things in smart maritime ports","2022","It is estimated that 80% of world trade is transported via maritime logistic. The maritime trade networks can be seen as a graph with links and nodes. For an optimal network, the links representing the maritime routes must be short (with minimal cost) and secure. The nodes of the network represents the maritime ports, which are hub sending, receiving or switching the goods (in form of containers). The ports has passed from analog to digital ports to make use of IT tools to speed up the process, especially the administrative part. Nowadays, we talk about smart ports that uses data to further speed up the process administratively but also use a full automation to accelerate/optimize the processing of the goods/containers in terminals/quay. Terminal Operation System (TOS) is the main components in these operations. Therefore, the use of Internet-of-Thing (IoT) in TOS a decisive step towards smart ports.

"a prototype gui for unmanned air vehicle mission planning and execution","2014","This paper describes the development of a graphical user interface which provides unique mission control services to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators. The software has two modes of operation, Planning Mode and Execution Mode. In Planning Mode an operator can readily simulate a desired flight plan to determine mission feasibility. Key features of this mode include integration of forecast weather data and interactive trajectory planning. Harsh North Atlantic weather can jeopardize a mission, so running a simulation with predicted wind conditions may greatly reduce the risk of a UAV loss. In Execution Mode the operator can deploy an autonomous vehicle, change the route “on the fly”, hold the aircraft over a point of interest, and return the UAV to home base whenever necessary. In both modes the predicted and actual weather conditions are the key to mission success. All weather data required for these functions is automatically downloaded via the internet. Operation of the software, including interactive trajectory planning, weather observation, mission planning and execution, is achieved through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Simulation results, flight trajectories, and weather data can be saved for further analysis. Comparing missions with and without weather information, it was determined that meteorological information can have a very significant impact on the mission success or failure. In a typical example mission discussed here, including forecast weather conditions increased the UAV's fuel consumption by 18% and mission time by 26%.","airborne surveillance,autonomous vehicles,maritime security,UAV mission planning,graphical user interface,UAV mission control,Unmanned aerial vehicle control,"
"observation needs for climate information, prediction and application: capabilities of existing and future observing systems","2010","The demand for long-term, sustained, reliable data and derived information on climate and its changes has never been greater than today. Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","GEOSS,climate observations,GEO,ECV,GAW,GTOS,GOOS,essential climate variables,GCOS,"
"improved visualization of large temporal series for the evaluation of good environmental status","2019","Passive acoustic monitoring of underwater sounds is an emerging discipline that can be used to guarantee that anthropogenic noise meets acceptable limits, to detect the presence of cetacean species, and to ensure sustainable exploitation of our oceans and seas.

Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events. We propose a framework for the creation of such visualization techniques and analyze the different stages involved: data reduction, color encoding, and signal processing on graphs.

"spatiotemporal variability in bio-optical characteristics of the southwestern tropical indian ocean during boreal summer: biophysical influences","2022","The bio-optical characteristics of the surface ocean play a pivotal role in radiative transfer and photosynthetic carbon fixation. To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photoacclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by integrating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant relationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO. The in situ Chl-a, aph(443), adg(443), Kd(490) and C¯ pd were used to validate the various empirical algorithms available as well as the satellite-retrieved data. The MODIS and VIIRS data correlated moderately. This study would help towards improving regional optimized algorithms for OAS and provide a baseline understanding of the scale of variability of primary production and carbon flux from space. In addition, this would contribute valuable bio-optical data from an under-sampled geographical area.","Subsurface stratification,Light absorption,Tropical Indian Ocean,Particulate backscattering,Deep chlorophyll maxima,Phytoplankton pigments,"
"bio-inspired topology control mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicles used in maritime surveillance","2013","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in maritime applications to acquire underwater information. With the guidance of intelligent topology control algorithms, AUVs adjust their positions efficiently such that they achieve desired underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) configurations. A suitable application can be using AUVs in surveillance tasks, where they uniformly spread throughout a harbor entry or around a large civilian or military maritime vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier) to detect any hostile or unexpected underwater intrusions. Since geographical characteristics are different for each port (shape, depth, etc.) and underwater currents constantly change, manually controlling underwater vehicles for these tasks is not feasible. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based topology control mechanism, called 3D-PSO, for AUVs operating in unknown 3D underwater spaces. 3D-PSO uses limited information collected from an AUV's neighborhood to make movement decisions over an unknown 3D space. Each AUV, using our 3D-PSO, is able to adjust its movement speed and direction to achieve a better location towards obtaining a uniform distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, despite the significant variance of topographies of harbor entrances and the undersides of ships, 3D-PSO is an efficient tool to guide AUVs in creating a protection area for a harbor or a maritime vessel.","surveillance,topology control,bio-inspired topology control mechanism,harbor entrances,underwater information,civilian vessel,bio-inspired algorithms,particle swarm optimisation,3D-PSO,underwater wireless sensor networks,protection area,Network topology,wireless sensor networks,Topology,maritime surveillance,self-organizing networks,particle swarm optimization,autonomous underwater vehicles,Underwater vehicles,unknown 3D underwater spaces,harbor entry,surveillance tasks,military maritime vessel,Nickel,UWSN configurations,marine vehicles,intelligent topology control algorithms,underwater wireless sensor network configuration,AUVs,security,unexpected underwater intrusion detection,Mobile nodes,geographical characteristics,"
"changes in water properties around north pacific intermediate water between the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s","2010","We detected temperature (salinity) decreases on the neutral density surfaces above the salinity minimum and increases below throughout the western North Pacific subtropical gyre (25∘N–40∘N, west of 170∘W) by comparing World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic sections from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The temperature (salinity) changes around the salinity minimum were associated with an apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) increase, and could not be explained by an increase of the subpolar input. These property changes were due to a density decrease of the salinity minimum. Furthermore, similar changes in temperature (salinity) were detected along 165∘E as a 12-year trend from 1996 to 2007. This suggests that the changes evident in the comparison of the WOCE sections are the representative of changes at the intermediate depths in the last decade. This pattern was not detected in the eastern subtropical gyre (25∘N–40∘N, east of 170∘W) and along 47∘N, where the AOU increase due to ventilation reduction has been reported. Along 47∘N, changes in temperature, salinity and AOU from 1999 to 2007 were opposite to those from 1985 to 1999.","Apparent oxygen utilization,Decadal change,NPIW,WHP,"
"natural and anthropogenic submarine morphologies revealed by high resolution acoustic data in the gulf of izmir, western turkey","2016","This study includes the interpretation of submarine morphological structures using the multibeam echo sounder bathymetry and CHIRP high resolution seismic in the Gulf of Izmir. The faults as the indicator of active tectonics, submarine channels, gas seeps, active and inactive pockmarks are the main natural morphological features in the gulf. Additionally, man-made (anthropogenic) structures like navigation channels, excavation debrises and ships wrecks are also observed. Geomorphological development of the gulf is controlled by the active faults in the Neotectonic period. Therefore, detection of active faults is very critical for the morphology of the gulf where many faults with different orientations have been interpreted on the seismic data. In the central-outer part of the gulf to the W NW, there are some normal faults trending in the N NW and S SE direction, and in the eastern and southern part of the gulf, E–W trending normal faults are evident in the seabed topography. The water depth increases from the eastern (inner) to the outer section of the gulf in the W NW direction. The N NE margin and the coastal area are very shallow (<25 m) because of the Quaternary deltaic sediment influx from the Gediz River. There are several biogenic, shallow gas accumulations in and around the delta of this river. In addition, many active and inactive pockmarks and gas seeps are also observed in the delta sediments and near the active faults as evidence of hydrocarbon generation and seepage.","Gulf of Izmir,Gediz Delta,Uzunada Fault Zone,Chirp,Multibeam echo sounder,"
"long-term trends in daily extreme air temperature indices in ireland from 1885 to 2018","2022","Long-term instrumental series are crucial to analyse extreme air temperature indices and to examine modern climate warming within a historical context. This research provides the first assessment in Ireland of the frequency, duration, intensity and geographical distribution of the daily extreme air temperature indices recommended by the ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) and based on long-term rescued, quality-controlled and homogenised data. Prior analysis of air temperature indices in Ireland had focused on the period since the second half of the 20th century, where digital data were readily available. Earlier estimations of long-term air temperature trends in Ireland focused on non-homogenised data from a small network of stations. For this research, 11 long-term (1885–2018) maximum and minimum air temperature series were analysed to assess seasonal and annual trends and construct extreme air temperature indices in Ireland. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was employed to test the statistical significance of the maximum and minimum air temperatures and indices trends (p < 0.05). Significant increasing trends were assessed in the seasonal and annual maximum and minimum air temperature series in Ireland, with greater increases in the spring and autumn seasons. Significant increasing trends were determined in the warm days (+6.8 days), warm nights (+7.5 nights), warm spell duration index (+3.9 days), growing season length (+22 days), coldest night (+2.7 °C) and coldest day (+1.5 °C) in the period 1885–2018 in Ireland. In the same period, significant decreasing trends were identified in the cold days (−9.3 days), cold nights (−7 nights), frost days (−13.7 days), cold spell duration index (−6.9 days) and diurnal air temperature range (−0.1 °C) in Ireland. The results follow global patterns presented in the Six Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The findings of this research will be crucial to assist stakeholders and policymakers in defining climate action, adaptation and mitigation plans in response to shifting trends in air temperature extremes.","Air temperature trends,Historical weather extremes,Ireland,Extreme air temperature indices,Climate change,"
"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of â€œrisksâ€ as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","Markov processes,decision support systems,hidden Markov models,statistical distributions,tokenization,Risk management,attacked vessel incident,human intuition,Hidden Markov models,maritime geographical locations,conditional Markov models,maritime domain awareness,maritime command-and-control centers,Feature extraction,natural language processing,chased vessel incident,entity extraction,variable-length risk span extraction,maritime incident reports,maritime situational awareness,sequence classification algorithms,conditional random fields,robbed vessel incident,electronic sensors,United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository,maritime situational awareness operation,fired vessel incident,marine safety,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,marine engineering,boarded vessel incident,feature annotation,machine learning,semiautomated decision support systems,cameras,part-of-speech tagging,risk management,NLP/ML-based system,Classification algorithms,probability distributions,risks types,risk classification performance,textual risk mining system,weekly textual reports,auxiliary ML,auxiliary machine learning,hijacked vessel incident,command and control systems,vessels,human perception,vessel types,MSA operation,kidnapped vessel incident,risk associates,risk detection,NGA,text analysis,boarding attempted vessel incident,approached vessel incident,Data mining,learning (artificial intelligence),sequence-based classifiers,"
"vulnerability and resilience of transportation systems: a recent literature review","2021","With the development of integrated and intelligent transportation systems, the stability and security of system performance are highly emphasized. Resilience and vulnerability are representative indicators in the performance analysis of transportation systems. A large number of related studies have emerged in recent years. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress in the study of vulnerability and resilience. Specific definitions of resilience and vulnerability are first given from the perspective of transportation system’s supply and demand. Other related concepts of transportation system performance (TSP) are also discussed including reliability, robustness, survivability and risk. The existing studies can be divided into two aspects, i.e., the traditional topological structure and system structure analysis. The study of topology structure mainly revolves around graph theory, which is also the cornerstone of TSP research. In recent years, advances in data analysis and model simulation technology have led to an increasing number of studies considering the overall transportation system structure. The related metrics and research methods are carefully analyzed and summarized from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Research challenges are discussed, and future directions are presented.","Resilience,Network performance,Transportation system,Vulnerability,"
"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container intrusion, either door or side panel intrusion.","accelerometers,container tracking,container intrusion,FM broadcast,Monitoring,Global Positioning System,maritime containers,object tracking,Containers,Noise,IEEE 892.15.4 wireless,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Active RFID,sea ports,USA Councils,containers,GPS,Logic gates,radiofrequency identification,Receivers,Maritime container traceability,tracking system,"
"multiple ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck processes for maritime traffic graph representation","2018","We propose an unsupervised procedure to automatically extract a graph-based model of commercial maritime traffic routes from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. In the proposed representation, the main elements of maritime traffic patterns, such as maneuvering regions and sea-lanes, are represented, respectively, with graph vertices and edges. Vessel motion dynamics are defined by multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with different long-run mean parameters, which in our approach can be estimated with a change detection procedure based on Page's test, aimed to reveal the spatial points representative of velocity changes. A density-based clustering algorithm is then applied to aggregate the detected changes into groups of similar elements and reject outliers. To validate the proposed graph-based representation of the maritime traffic, two performance criteria are tested against a real-world trajectory dataset collected off the Iberian Coast and the English Channel. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is suitable to be integrated at any level of a JDL system.","automatic identification system data,unsupervised learning,density-based clustering algorithm,Marine vehicles,maritime traffic routes,Mathematical model,JDL system,maritime traffic patterns,Pages Test OU Process,maneuvering regions,Stochastic processes,Electronic mail,Maritime Surveillance Awareness (MSA),DBSCAN,ships,vessel motion dynamics,marine engineering,spatial points representative,Page's test,Data models,unsupervised procedure,maritime traffic graph representation,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,English Channel,graph theory,Trajectory,multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,trajectory dataset,sea-lanes,long-run mean parameters,Iberian Coast,collision avoidance,AIS data,Graph-based Maritime Traffic Representation,change detection procedure,"
"colregs-compliant unmanned surface vehicles collision avoidance based on improved differential evolution algorithm","2024","Unmanned surface vessel (USV) has a wide range of applications in oceanographic research, resource development, environment detection, and security rescue due to its advantages of maneuverability, flexibility, fast response, and intelligence. The ability of USVs to autonomously and effectively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic and uncertain marine environments is a prerequisite for the successful completion of their tasks. Therefore, in this article, a USV collision avoidance based on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and the Collision Risk Model with the Improved Differential Evolution Algorithm (CRI-DE) has been considered. Based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) and common practices of seafarers, an improved ship collision risk model is proposed. Specifically, the model is innovatively combined with the differential evolution algorithm (DE) as a constraint condition to further realize path planning in complex situations. Moreover, chaotic multi-population parallel optimization, parameter adaptive adjustment strategy, and the construction of fitness function based on individual path points are added to the DE. In this way, the ability to escape from local optima and enrich population diversity can be guaranteed. Finally, experiments based on the proposed CRI-DE are conducted and the results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Collision risk model,Path planning,Multi-ship collision avoidance,Improved differential evolution algorithm,"
"material discrimination using scattering and stopping of cosmic ray muons and electrons: differentiating heavier from lighter metals as well as low-atomic weight materials","2015","Reported is a new method to apply cosmic-ray tomography in a manner that can detect and characterize not only dense assemblages of heavy nuclei (like Special Nuclear Materials, SNM) but also assemblages of medium- and light-atomic-mass materials (such as metal parts, conventional explosives, and organic materials). Characterization may enable discrimination between permitted contents in commerce and contraband (explosives, illegal drugs, and the like). Our Multi-Mode Passive Detection System (MMPDS) relies primarily on the muon component of cosmic rays to interrogate Volumes of Interest (VOI). Muons, highly energetic and massive, pass essentially un-scattered through materials of light atomic mass and are only weakly scattered by conventional metals used in industry. Substantial scattering and absorption only occur when muons encounter sufficient thicknesses of heavy elements characteristic of lead and SNM. Electrons are appreciably scattered by light elements and stopped by sufficient thicknesses of materials containing medium-atomic-mass elements (mostly metals). Data include simulations based upon GEANT and measurements in the HMT (Half Muon Tracker) detector in Poway, CA and a package scanner in both Poway and Socorro NM. A key aspect of the present work is development of a useful parameter, designated the “stopping power” of a sample. The low-density regime, comprising organic materials up to aluminum, is characterized using very little scattering but a strong variation in stopping power. The medium-to-high density regime shows a larger variation in scattering than in stopping power. The detection of emitted gamma rays is another useful signature of some materials.","Material properties,Contraband,Radiation length,Homeland security,Cosmic rays,Highly enriched uranium,"
"reversals of the geomagnetic field, magnetostratigraphy, and relative magnitude of paleosecular variation in the phanerozoic","1976","The percentage of normal and reversed magnetization in land-based paleomagnetic studies of Phanerozoic rocks (0 to − 570 m.y.) have been compiled in order to determine the long-term variation in polarity bias of the geomagnetic field. Where possible the results are compared with the record from marine magnetic anomalies. Only rarely is there an even balance between normal and reversed polarity. During the past 350 m.y. two quiet intervals can be recognized when few reversals occurred, the Cretaceous (KN about − 81 to − 110 m.y.) and Permo-Carboniferous (PCR about − 227 to − 313 m.y.). Less firmly established are two other quiet intervals, one in the Jurassic (JN about − 145 to − 165 m.y.), and one in the Triassic (TRN about − 205 to − 220 m.y.). Between these quiet intervals there are disturbed intervals when reversals were comparatively frequent. From − 680 to − 350 m.y. the paleomagnetic record is inadequate to delineate a succession of quiet and disturbed intervals although one is probably present. Maximum entropy spectral analysis reveals three periodicities, a dominant one at about 300 m.y. and others, less well-defined, at 113 and 57 m.y. The variations in polarity bias are compared with the paleosecular variation, and it is shown that the magnitude of the paleosecular variation is greater in disturbed than in quiet intervals. This indicates that the magnitude of paleosecular variation and polarity bias are governed by variations in the balance between non-dipole and dipole components of the field, and that these variations probably had their origin in processes near the core—mantle interface. The correspondence between the dominant periods of 300 m.y. and plate tectonics is noted and a causal relationship suggested.",""
"north american vegetation dynamics observed with multi-resolution satellite data","2008","We investigated normalized difference vegetation index data from the NOAA series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers and found regions in North America that experienced marked increases in annual photosynthetic capacity at various times from 1982 to 2005. Inspection of these anomalous areas with multi-resolution data from Landsat, Ikonos, aerial photography, and ancillary data revealed a range of causes for the NDVI increases: climatic influences; severe drought and subsequent recovery; irrigated agriculture expansion; insect outbreaks followed by logging and subsequent regeneration; and forest fires with subsequent regeneration. Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions. The local variability of drivers of change demonstrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in NDVI and indicates the complex nature of changes in the carbon cycle within North America. Coarse scale analysis of changes could well fail to identify the important local scale drivers controlling the carbon cycle and to identify the relative roles of disturbance and climate change. Our results document regional land cover land use change and climatic influences that have altered continental scale vegetation dynamics in North America.","Landsat,NDVI,Climate,Land cover,Vegetation dynamics,AVHRR,"

"non-satellite broadband maritime communications for e-navigation services","2021","The development of broadband network access technologies available to users on land has triggered a rapid expansion of a diverse range of services provided by terrestrial networks. However, due to limitations of digital communication technologies in the off-shore area, the maritime ICT systems evolution so far has not followed that trend. Despite the e-navigation initiative defining the set of Maritime Services, the progress in the maritime ICT systems evolution has been slow. Only a few systems, including the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES), or the TRI-Media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) have been proposed to extend the basic set of services offered by classical radio-communication solutions. However, all those systems have significant limitations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the netBaltic system designed as a fully heterogeneous system for modern maritime communications. Its unique feature is the capability to transparently use different communication technologies to efficiently support maritime ICT services, as well as openness for the incorporation of future communication technologies. The paper presents an overview of VDES, TRITON and netBaltic systems and analysis showing their expected strengths and weaknesses. The systems are then compared in simulated environments, illustrating real-world usage scenarios based on real maritime traffic information and performance measurements obtained during off-shore measurement campaigns. Results indicate that netBaltic seems to be the most versatile one and is capable of offering access to all services defined by International Maritime Organization, due to its ability to use different communication technologies simultaneously and functionality offered by its Delay Tolerant Networking component.","international maritime organization,Safety,wireless mesh networks,broadband network access technologies,wireless communication,Organizations,Communication systems,Wireless communication,VHF data exchange system,maritime ICT services,future communication technologies,maritime ICT systems evolution,different communication technologies,satellite communication,data communication,performance measurements,terrestrial networks,Broadband communication,digital communication technologies,TRI media telematic oceanographic network,modern maritime communications,netBaltic system,maritime services,maritime traffic information,telecommunication traffic,fully heterogeneous system,marine technology,classical radio communication solution,nonsatellite broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,computer networks,marine communication,e-navigation Services,network topology,mobile communication,Navigation,Task analysis,Information and communication technology,"

"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"a merchant ship thermo-salinograph network in the pacific ocean","1996","The need for better knowledge of sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) distribution in the tropical oceans was brought to light during the 10 years of the TOGA programme (1985–1994). In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.",""
"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance.

However, the same system may not be adapted to maritime communication due to the geographically restricted nature of the sea, and therefore, MF/HF modems, capable of long-distance transmission, with low data-rate are frequently employed in maritime communication. Maritime satellite communication through Inmarsat is conventionally used to compensate for the low data-rate transmission of MF/HF modems, but its high cost still remains as a main drawback. In order to enhance the transmission speed with a fairly low price, in general, a network whose architecture is similar to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), that allows peer-to-peer communications without base stations, i.e., ad-hoc network, is crucial. Herein, we propose an ad-hoc network for nautical environment, which is named as Nautical Ad-hoc Network (NANET). In this paper, scenarios toward NANET development are described and analysis of multiple access and duplexing schemes for corresponding NANET scenarios is discussed. A guideline for further research and developmental strategies on NANET is also suggested.","Wireless communication,NANET,Peer to peer computing,ad hoc networks,Underwater communication,Marine safety,IP networks,mobile communication,Ad hoc networks,Modems,Costs,Satellite communication,marine vehicles,Base stations,peer-to-peer communications,Marine vehicles,maritime communications,nautical ad-hoc network,"

"adaptive detection of spatial point event outliers using multilevel constrained delaunay triangulation","2016","Spatial outlier detection is a research hot spot in the field of spatial data mining. Because of the lack of specific research on spatial point events, this study presents an adaptive approach for spatial point events outlier detection (SPEOD) using multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation. First, the spatial proximity relationships between spatial point events are roughly captured by Delaunay triangulation. Then, three-level constraints are described and used to refine spatial proximity relationships with the consideration of statistical characteristics. Finally, those spatial point events connected by remaining edges are gathered to form a series of subgraphs. Those subgraphs containing very few point events are regarded as spatial outliers. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world spatial data sets are used to show that the proposed SPEOD algorithm can detect various types of spatial point event outliers with high efficiency. Moreover, there is no need to input any parameter in SPEOD.","Spatial point events,Multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation,Spatial outliers,"
"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above âˆ’5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets. Compared with the popular used CNN method, e.g., LeNet, the proposed method can achieve higher detection probability with the same given false alarm rate.","marine radar,deep learning (artificial intelligence),signal processing,radar detection,graph data processing,radar clutter,graph convolutional network,conventional statistical theory-based methods,radar signals,Feature extraction,sea clutter,signal sampling,Manganese,deep learning,radar target detection,temporal-spatial domain correlation information,object detection,radar signal graph data,convolutional neural networks-based target detection methods,Radar,graph theory,Convolution,radar signal processing,convolutional neural nets,graph structure data,Graph convolutional network (GCN),higher detection probability,graph data,temporal information,CNN method,marine targets,maritime target detection method,Clutter,Object detection,signal-to-noise ratio,radar graph data,maritime target,Radar detection,spatial information,"

"a history of vegetation, sediment and nutrient dynamics at tivoli north bay, hudson estuary, new york","2012","We conduct a stratigraphic paleoecological investigation at a Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HRNERR) site, Tivoli Bays, spanning the past 1100 years. Marsh sediment cores were analyzed for ecosystem changes using multiple proxies, including pollen, spores, macrofossils, charcoal, sediment bulk chemistry, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. The results reveal climatic shifts such as the warm and dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) followed by the cooler Little Ice Age (LIA), along with significant anthropogenic influence on the watershed ecosystem. A five-fold expansion of invasive species, including Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis, is documented along with marked changes in sediment composition and nutrient input. During the last century, a ten-fold sedimentation rate increase due to land-use changes is observed. The large magnitude of shifts in vegetation, sedimentation, and nutrients during the last few centuries suggest that human activities have made the greatest impact to the marshes of the Hudson Estuary during the last millennium. Climate variability and ecosystem changes similar to those observed at other marshes in northeastern and mid-Atlantic estuaries, attest to the widespread regional signature recorded at Tivoli Bays.","nitrogen cycle,tidal marshes,invasive species,New York,Little Ice Age,Medieval Warm period,paleoecology,stable isotopes,climate change,European settlement,palynology,"
"a machine learning-based accuracy enhancement on eumetsat h-saf h35 effective snow-covered area product","2022","Snow is a major element of the cryosphere with significant impact on the Earth's water cycle and global energy budget. Acquiring consistent and long time series data on the spatial extent of snow cover doubtlessly plays a key role in our understanding and modeling of the current and future environmental dynamics. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for continuous retrieval of snow cover information by utilizing snow's contrasting reflectance characteristics at optical wavelengths. The pre-operational H35 covers the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the successor of the operational Pan-European H12 daily fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) product at ~1 km. Both products are developed through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of EUMETSAT by exploiting AVHRR channels. This study is focused on developing an alternative fully data-driven H35 product with improved accuracy using a machine learning (ML)-based approach. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithm is trained by using AVHRR reflectance data as well as the well-known snow and vegetation indices (i.e., NDSI and NDVI) to generate the new version of H35 fSCA product. The reference fSCA maps required for the training of MARS models are obtained from the higher resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The MARS-based fSCA models are validated against an initial test dataset composed of 15 Sentinel 2 scenes over European Alps, Tatra Mountain Range, and Turkey. The final MARS-H35 product is then rigorously assessed over the whole Northern Hemisphere within a temporal domain spanning from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019. The quantitative testing process involves the use of reference data in both continuous and dichotomous scales: i) Sentinel 2 derived reference fSCA maps, ii) ERA5-Land snow depth data, iii) MODIS MOD10A1 NDSI snow cover data, and finally iv) in-situ snow depth data. Additionally, qualitative assessment is also performed by visually comparing MARS-H35/MODIS false-color and MARS-H35/Sentinel 2-derived reference fSCA image pairs over various geographic regions. The overall results indicate that: i) the proposed MARS-H35 fSCA product overperforms the original H35, and ii) it has higher capability in detecting the fine variations in the extent of snow cover, especially across the fringes of the slopes in complex mountainous terrains.","Multivariate adaptive regression splines,Sentinel 2,ERA5-Land,Remote sensing of the cryosphere,Fractional snow cover mapping,AVHRR,MODIS,"
"traffic pattern detection using the hough transformation for anomaly detection to improve maritime domain awareness","2014","Techniques for extracting traffic patterns from ship position data to generate atlases of expected ocean travel are developed in this paper. An archive of historical data is used to develop a traffic density grid. The Hough transformation is used to extract linear patterns of elevated density from the traffic density grid, which can be considered the â€œhighwaysâ€ of the oceans. These highways collectively create an atlas that is used to define geographical regions of expected ship locations. The atlas generation techniques are demonstrated using automated information system (AIS) ship position data to detect highways in both open-ocean and coastal areas. Additionally, the atlas generation techniques are used to explore variability in ship traffic as a result of extreme weather. The development of an automatic atlas generation technique that can be used to develop a definition of normal maritime behavior is a significant result of this research.","Traffic control,historical data archive,highway detection,Pattern Extraction,geographical regions,automatic atlas generation technique,cartography,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,traffic density grid,geography,AIS ship position data,Meteorology,Hough transformation,normal maritime behavior,ships,Maritime Domain Awareness,marine engineering,Hough Transformation,Hough transforms,Oceans,traffic information systems,traffic pattern extraction,coastal area,automated information system ship position data,linear pattern extraction,traffic pattern detection,Road transportation,Market research,ship traffic,image processing,Data mining,ocean travel,open-ocean area,Automated Information System,"

"classification of daily heavy precipitation patterns and associated synoptic types in the campania region (southern italy)","2023","Using a 20-year (2002−2021) dataset of daily precipitation collected by 107 rain gauges in the period from October to May, this study introduces a classification of the main heavy precipitation spatial patterns for the Campania Region (southern Italy). To pursue this aim, we apply a cluster analysis on the most relevant principal modes extracted from a principal component analysis of the between-day correlation matrix. The characteristics of the identified patterns, as well as their interannual and monthly distribution, are presented and discussed. Moreover, using global and regional reanalysis products, we have determined the large-scale and mesoscale atmospheric circulation types associated with heavy precipitation patterns. The heavy precipitation episodes are generally triggered by an upper level trough approaching the southern Italy from west and promoting a very moist southwesterly flow. They have been clustered into six different patterns. The first four exhibit a rainfall amount distribution strongly connected with the orography of the investigated region. In such scenarios, the orographic lifting, the low-level wind convergence induced by the orography and the transport of moisture from local sources (the western and the southern Mediterranean) and from distant regions (the Atlantic and the Africa tropical areas) can be regarded as the primary forcing of heavy rainfall. In the other two patterns, the highest precipitation is generally observed in the coastal areas (Gulfs of Naples and Salerno) and in the northwestern side of the region (Caserta district), respectively. In such circumstances, the abundant precipitation is closely linked to convective activity over the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is sustained by a low-level convergence and, in the sixth pattern, by a moisture plume coming from the tropics. The results of this study provide new insights about the links between torrential precipitation spatial distribution and atmospheric circulation schemes in the southern Italy and promise to add a useful contribution for civil protection activities related to the management of environmental risks.","Rainfall spatial patterns,Atmospheric circulation types,Heavy precipitation events,Cluster analysis,"
"security of federated learning with iot systems: issues, limitations, challenges, and solutions","2023","Federated Learning (FL, or Collaborative Learning (CL)) has surely gained a reputation for not only building Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on distributed datasets, but also for starting to play a key role in security and privacy solutions to protect sensitive data and information from a variety of ML-related attacks. This made it an ideal choice for emerging networks such as Internet of Things (IoT) systems, especially with its state-of-the-art algorithms that focus on their practical use over IoT networks, despite the presence of resource-constrained devices. However, the heterogeneous nature of the current devices and models in complex IoT networks has seriously hindered the FL training process's ability to perform well. Thus, rendering it almost unsuitable for direct deployment over IoT networks despite ongoing efforts to tackle this issue and overcome this challenging obstacle. As a result, the main characteristics of FL in the IoT from both security and privacy aspects are presented in this study. We broaden our research to investigate and analyze cutting-edge FL algorithms, models, and protocols, with a focus on their efficacy and practical application across IoT networks and systems alike. This is followed by a comparative analysis of the recently available protection solutions for FL that can be based on cryptographic and non-cryptographic solutions over heterogeneous, dynamic IoT networks. Moreover, the proposed work provides a list of suggestions and recommendations that can be applied to enhance the effectiveness of the adoption of FL and to achieve higher robustness against attacks, especially in heterogeneous dynamic IoT networks and in the presence of resource-constrained devices.",""
"spatial relationship between phytophthora ramorum and roads or streams in oregon tanoak forests","2014","The pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of sudden oak death (SOD) of oaks and tanoaks, continues to expand its range within Oregon despite an effort to eradicate it from native forests. With its early detection and prompt removal of infected hosts, the Oregon SOD eradication program has produced a landscape distribution of disease resulting predominantly from the long distance (100m to 4km) dispersal of inoculum between sites. Using a regionally restricted randomization test reflecting the south to north intensification of the SOD epidemic in Oregon, we assessed if the movement of P. ramorum between sites was spatially dependant upon roads and streams, topographic features associated with the landscape-scale movement of soil and water borne inoculum of related Phytophthora spp. Dissimilar to other forest Phytophthora spp. we found no association between SOD sites and the road network. We did, however, determine that SOD sites are occurring closer to streams than would be expected by chance, especially in regions with microclimates less conducive to establishment. Environmental conditions and/or dispersal mechanisms associated with streams may contribute to the distribution of SOD in Oregon tanoak forests. Monitoring and management should therefore concentrate on susceptible forests in close proximity to streams, especially in stands further inland from a coastal climate.","Sudden oak death,Spatial spread,Invasive pathogen,Forest pathology,Restricted randomization,"
"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","medical signal processing,surveillance,Electroencephalography,Electroencephalography (EEG),Internet of Things (IoT),ship detection,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,maritime image scenes,Feature extraction,smart ocean applications,IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems,maritime object detection,automated maritime object detection,ships,electroencephalography-based maritime object detection algorithm,Oceans,object detection,feature extraction,intelligent surveillance systems,IoT-driven marine surveillance systems,IoT devices,image sensors,smart ocean,Object detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),electroencephalography,"
"fatigue life prediction of corrosion-damaged high-strength steel using an equivalent stress riser (esr) model: part i: test development and results","2009","The fatigue life of metallic aircraft structural components can be significantly reduced by environmentally induced corrosion. As part of a NAVAIR High Strength Steel Corrosion–Fatigue Assessment Program, methods were studied to predict the impact that corrosion-induced surface roughness has on the fatigue life of high-strength steel aircraft components. In order to adequately capture the corrosion damage features that cause fatigue cracking, a representative set of well-characterized corrosion–fatigue test results were generated to be used for model development. The test specimens fabricated for this program consisted of bare, unnotched AF1410 steel flat plates with a 25.4mm diameter corrosion patch on one side. Two sets of test specimens were fabricated and tested, with one set abrasive blasted after heat treatment, and the other set hand polished after heat treatment. A method of growing corrosion in the laboratory was developed that consisted of filter paper soaked in a 3.5% NaCl solution and placed at the center of the test plate gage section, with a voltage applied across the filter paper to accelerate corrosion growth. High-resolution 3D surface topography data was collected from the corroded region on each test plate prior to fatigue testing using a commercial white-light interference microscope. Constant-amplitude fatigue tests were performed on corroded and uncorroded test plates at several different stress levels, for three different corrosion exposure levels. Post-test fractographic analysis of the corroded specimens indicate that all of the critical cracks originated from small corrosion notches on the order of 10–200μm in width, 10–120μm in height and 2–100μm in depth. These notches were not considered to be pits in that the depth dimension was less than the surface dimensions. The repeatability of the fatigue initiating mechanism for corrosion damaged surfaces in this material indicates that it should be possible to develop a single modeling approach that reasonably captures the effects of corrosion notches in reducing fatigue life.","Corrosion fatigue,Life prediction,Notches,Probabilistic analysis,Fatigue initiation,"
"changes in the supply of eastern mediterranean glasses to visigothic spain","2019","This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of glass compositions from Visigothic Spain using high resolution laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Major, minor and trace element patterns of 169 well-dated samples from three rural Iberian sites (Congosto, Gózquez and El Pelícano) have brought to light major chronological developments in the production, circulation and use of glass between the fifth and the eighth century CE. The data identify four distinct compositional groups of Egyptian and Levantine origin. Egyptian Foy 2.1, Foy 2.1 high Fe and so-called Magby alongside Apollonia-type Levantine I were the main glass types of the Visigothic period. Due to the tight dating of the majority of the samples, we were able to reveal fundamental changes in the geographical scope of glass supplies to the Iberian Peninsula, and to refine the chronological range of the known primary production groups. The glass group commonly known as série 2.1 or Foy 2.1 started being produced already during the second half of the fifth century. The appearance of Foy 2.1 high Fe can likewise be moved forward to the first half of the sixth century. A plant-ash group referred to as Magby was introduced around the middle of the sixth century. Egypt was undeniably the main supplier of raw glasses to the Iberian Peninsula up to the mid-sixth century CE, after which the Levantine I group became the prime glass type among the analysed assemblages. In the final stages of the Visigothic Kingdom and the early years of Islamic dominion, there is a noticeable drop in the absolute quantity of glass available, together with an increase in recycling. The implications of these transformations in the supply of glass for the organisation of Mediterranean trade are discussed.","Levantine I,Foy 2.1,Recycling,Foy 2.1 high Fe,Magby,Foy 2.2,LA-ICP-MS,"

The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed. The result shows that the deviation of distance location is less than 200 meters, and the deviation of azimuth is less than 6'. The error is reasonable for real application.

"gas - escape features along the trzebiatów fault offshore poland: evidence for a leaking petroleum system","2023","New 2D high-resolution seismic and hydro-acoustic data demonstrate the presence of methane in the shallow sediments and its origin in the Pomeranian Bight, south of the Baltic Sea area. Various shallow gas features including chimneys, bright spots, acoustic blanking, pockmarks, and polarity reversal were identified in the Gryfice block, along the inverted Trzebiatów fault zone. Structural and stratigraphic interpretation with support of seismic attributes shows the potential of fluid migration pathways from the Upper Triassic formation reservoirs to shallow sediments below the seafloor. It also helps in the explanation of how this natural gas escapes to the sea bottom. Amplitude-vs-offset (AVO) analysis proved free gas existence in the potential Upper Triassic reservoir, and helped locate free gas deposits within sediments. Hydro-acoustic data illustrated the gas chimneys’ anomalies and the corresponding free gas accumulation in Pleistocene to Quaternary successions. Leaking of gas to the seafloor was also proved by the exposure of pockmarks on multibeam (bathymetry) data at the seafloor. We combine seismic, hydro-acoustic data, and information on petroleum system from previous studies to explain the signatures of free gas and its migration from lower reservoirs to shallow sediments.","Hydro-acoustics,Petroleum system,Shallow gas,Reflection seismic,Fluid escape,"
"incorporating discrete unmanned maritime system data collections into ncei synthesized data products","2020","In recent years, Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) have become widely used in hydrographic surveys and oceanographic studies, especially in coastal regions. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has received an increased amount of data collected by UMS in the past 10 years. A variety of different types of data are typically collected simultaneously by UMS, which raises questions about the best practices for UMS data management. In this manuscript, we discuss enhancing the value of UMS data through integration into NCEI synthesized products. These products range from data-type specific databases like the Surface Underway Marine Database, and the World Ocean Database to analyses (value-added) products such as climatological mean fields and ocean time series of variables such as ocean heat and oxygen content.

The integration of data from Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) systems - such as gliders - into the World Ocean Database is also described. Data management procedures and quality controls are discussed. The application of standardized methods adds long-term value to the original UMS, and improves the quality and reliability of the synthesized products.

"potential of stochastic methods for improving convection-permitting ensemble forecasts of extreme events over the western mediterranean","2021","The design of convection-permitting ensemble prediction systems capable of producing accurate forecasts of disruptive events is an extraordinarily challenging effort. The difficulties associated with the detection of extreme events found at these scales motivates the research of methodologies that efficiently sample relevant uncertainties. This study investigates the potential of multiple techniques to account for model uncertainty. The performance of various stochastic schemes is assessed for an exceptional heavy precipitation episode which occurred in eastern Spain. In particular, the stochastic strategies are compared to a multiphysics approach in terms of both spread and skill. The analyzed techniques include stochastic parameterization perturbation tendency and perturbations to influential parameters within the microphysics scheme. The introduction of stochastic perturbations to the microphysics processes results in a larger ensemble spread throughout the entire simulation. Conversely, modifications to microphysics parameters generate small-scale perturbations that rapidly grow over areas with high convective instability, in contrast to the other methods, which produce more widespread perturbations. A conclusion of specific interest for the western Mediterranean, where deep moist convection and local orography play an important role, is that stochastic methods are shown to outperform a multiphysics-based ensemble for this case, indicating the potential positive impact of stochastic parameterizations for the forecast of extreme events in the region.","Microphysics,Ensemble prediction systems,Stochastic parameterization,Western Mediterranean,Heavy precipitation episodes,"

Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) requires the trainees to be assessed and deemed competent in maritime mathematics, a New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) Level 3 course with 15 credits is to assess for competency in maritime mathematics in the following six topics: Algebra, Mensuration, Graphs, Calculus, Geometry, Trigonometry. Until end of 2021, the program specific regulations allow open entry for domestic students and no mathematics access criteria for international students. This means that the students start their maritime mathematics class at varying levels of proficiency. However, all learning outcomes in six maritime mathematics topics must be achieved for a student to be deemed competent by completion of their training programs. A study is conducted to identify the gaps caused by the open entry policy, based on observation of interaction of teaching and learning with results in course final exam, to analyze the weakness of the current teaching contents and start Maritime Mathematics course renovation in maritime training programs in New Zealand. This study has contributions to Programme Change Application, which has been approved by NZQA at end of 2021, that Applicants must meet the following criteria for admission into the programme Applicants with no seagoing experience: 14 credits in either Mathematics (calculus, algebra or equivalent) and/or Physics. As the programme Applicants with seagoing experience still have no mathematics access criteria, this study has led to the production of a new Industry-oriented teaching strategy to the course development in 2022. And a formative test at the time of student enrolment to identify this group of students. thus, a pre-course session will be offered to the group of students who are lack of Mathematics foundation.

"spectral anomaly methods for aerial detection using kut nuisance rejection","2015","This work discusses the application and optimization of a spectral anomaly method for the real-time detection of gamma radiation sources from an aerial helicopter platform. Aerial detection presents several key challenges over ground-based detection. For one, larger and more rapid background fluctuations are typical due to higher speeds, larger field of view, and geographically induced background changes. As well, the possible large altitude or stand-off distance variations cause significant steps in background count rate as well as spectral changes due to increased gamma-ray scatter with detection at higher altitudes. The work here details the adaptation and optimization of the PNNL-developed algorithm Nuisance-Rejecting Spectral Comparison Ratios for Anomaly Detection (NSCRAD), a spectral anomaly method previously developed for ground-based applications, for an aerial platform. The algorithm has been optimized for two multi-detector systems; a NaI(Tl)-detector-based system and a CsI detector array. The optimization here details the adaptation of the spectral windows for a particular set of target sources to aerial detection and the tailoring for the specific detectors. As well, the methodology and results for background rejection methods optimized for the aerial gamma-ray detection using Potassium, Uranium and Thorium (KUT) nuisance rejection are shown. Results indicate that use of a realistic KUT nuisance rejection may eliminate metric rises due to background magnitude and spectral steps encountered in aerial detection due to altitude changes and geographically induced steps such as at land–water interfaces.","Aerial detection,Radiation detection,KUT nuisance rejection,Spectral anomaly detection,Aerial search,"
"lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean marine protected area design","2017","Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.",""
"observing and understanding the southeast asian aerosol system by remote sensing: an initial review and analysis for the seven southeast asian studies (7seas) program","2013","Southeast Asia (SEA) hosts one of the most complex aerosol systems in the world, with convoluted meteorological scales, sharp geographic and socioeconomic features, high biological productivity, mixtures of a wide range of atmospheric pollutants, and likely a significant susceptibility to global climate change. This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems. The paper ends with a discussion of how the community can approach this complex and important environment.","Southeast Asia,Air Pollution,Biomass Burning,Aerosol,Meteorology,Remote Sensing,Maritime Continent,"
"gis-based identification of spatial variables enhancing heat and poor air quality in urban areas","2012","Due to anthropogenic climate change heat waves are expected to occur more frequently in the future, which might cause adverse health effects for urban population. Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist. In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000). Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic. A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites. The results of the chemical analyses support the results obtained from geo-statistical modeling. It reveals high concentrations of health relevant airborne species like metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the zone of enhanced risk for the coincidence of temperature stress and PM pollution.","Heat,Air pollution,Health,Particulate matter,Climate change,GIS,"
"multi-scale analysis reveals changing distribution patterns and the influence of social structure on the habitat use of an endangered marine predator, the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus in the western mediterranean sea","2020","The habitat use of marine megafauna emerges from the complex interplay between access to patchy and variable food resources and several intrinsic biological factors, such as the interaction with conspecifics and offspring care, resulting in dynamic distribution patterns. Quantifying species' relationships with the underlying environment is further complicated by the scale-dependent nature of these processes. Multi-scale analyses that incorporate aspects of a species' biology and build on large datasets are therefore required to understand long-term distribution and inform appropriate management measures. In this study, we use monitoring data collected over two study periods (2003–2008 and 2012–2018) to assess the habitat use, trend in local occurrence, and change in distribution of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, around the Balearic Islands (Spain), one of the few recognised breeding and feeding grounds for the ‘Endangered’ population in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we investigate the differences in the habitat use of single animals and groups, to explore intra-specific niche partitioning in this highly social but behaviourally dimorphic species. Results suggest that overall the occurrence of sperm whales in the area has been increasing over time. Animals were found to associate with distinct bathymetric features, but the mechanisms generating these relationships, and the underlying oceanographic processes within this habitat, remained uncertain. Sperm whale distribution also underwent a significant shift between the two study periods, with an increased occurrence in the Mallorca channel and north of Menorca, which further points towards a dynamic use of the broader bathymetric range preferred around the archipelago. Finally, our analyses highlighted that single animals and groups used areas with different characteristics, with groups preferring deeper, warmer waters characterised by lower sea level anomaly, which resulted in some fine-scale spatial segregation. The results of this study shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the biogeography and complex social system of the species, and support the design of targeted conservation measures in this important breeding and feeding ground.","Mediterranean sea,Distribution shift,Balearic archipelago,Sperm whale,Long-term monitoring,Habitat modeling,"

"modelling fire perimeter formation in the canadian rocky mountains","2022","Wildfires produce a mosaic of burned and unburned patches across varying temporal and spatial scales and provide a range of essential ecosystem services. Fire perimeters mark the separation between the burned and unburned matrix of a fire. Analysis of fire perimeters in the United States, Australia, and Alberta, have identified several key factors that influence the formation of a fire boundary, including fire environment variables, such as fuel, weather, and topographic conditions, as well as anthropogenic factors. We used matched case-control conditional logistic regression to assess the fire environment's influence on the formation of fire boundaries on the 2017 Verdant Creek Fire in the western Canadian Rocky Mountain region. Results indicated that fire boundary formation was strongly influenced by non-fuels, alpine and subalpine vegetation, wetland areas, and low and sparse shrub assemblages generally associated with avalanche paths. Fire cessation was more likely near waterways; however, the fire weather conditions that characterized most burning periods likely overrode other topographic influences. Fire cessation was most likely to occur one day following precipitation events when Vapour Pressure Deficit and Fire Weather Index values decreased. To explore the potential influence of spatial data resolution and fire mapping limitations on our results, we varied the distance between matched sample points selected on each side of the mapped fire perimeter during statistical modelling. Results demonstrated matched pairs of burned and unburned sample points were effective at representing discrete states when separated by at least 100 m and that insufficient or excessive separation between matched pairs confounds results, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analysis for determining the appropriate separation distance to represent burned and unburned states. We demonstrate a practical application of the model to predict spread potential, enabling rapid visual assessment of landscape locations most likely to limit fire spread.","Spatial analysis,Rocky Mountain forests,Wildland fire,Risk analysis,Fire extinguishment,Matched case-control conditional logistic regression,"
"research on the construction of maritime legal knowledge graph","2022","As the marine industry booms, the maritime legal documents are of great importance to the maneuver on the sea.

To mine knowledge from unstructured maritime laws and regulations, this paper proposes a method to build the maritime legal knowledge graph. To extract information from unstructured texts, BERT+BiLSTM+CRF is used for named entity recognition. DeepKE toolkit is used for relation extraction.

"estimation of the contributions of the sources driving pm2.5 levels in a central mediterranean coastal town","2018","Receptor modelling techniques are widely used in order to identify the main natural and anthropogenic processes driving aerosol levels at a receptor. In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Furthermore, we have isolated a factor exclusive to Malta: the fireworks component, which is responsible for 2.9% of the PM2.5 and which has health implications due to its chemical composition. The results of this work should also serve to guide the policy makers in achieving the necessary emission reductions in order to achieve the WHO guideline for PM2.5 by 2020.","PM,Positive matrix factorization,Natural aerosol sources,Anthropogenic aerosol sources,Source apportionment,Central mediterranean,"
"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","Length,Reproduction,Anchovy,Environment,Northern Chile,Humboldt Current System,"
"holocene surface hydroclimate changes in the indo-pacific warm pool","2018","The Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) is an area hosting key tropical climate processes such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The tropical climate processes, via various feedback mechanisms, control the surface ocean climate in the Indian Ocean and its surrounding continents on annual to inter-annual timescales. However, little has been known about how the tropical processes are effective forcing climate mechanism over longer timescales. Here we presented a reconstruction of the spatiotemporal pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) with inferred hydroclimate changes since the early Holocene (∼11ka), using proxies of planktonic foraminifer shell Mg/Ca, organic biomarker (TEX86), foraminifer oxygen isotopes, and a terrigenous BIT index measured from a 220 cm long Core BS24 (2.724041°N, 97.010943°E, 1015 m water depth) which was taken offshore of northwest Sumatra in the eastern Indian Ocean. With an age model of 13 AMS 14C dating by the uses of planktonic foraminiferal shells from the core, the TEX86H temperatures of BS24 show as summer-weighted, and reflect integrated thermal effects from the surface to thermocline water, while the Mg/Ca temperature of BS24 better reflects mean annual SST. Our results, along with a regional synthesis of published SST records from the IPWP, suggest that the IPWP has migrated eastwardly since the mid-Holocene (∼5ka). In phase with this eastward migration, the IPWP SSTs have decreased, but the upwelling in the eastern Indian Ocean appears to have been a persistent feature since the mid-Holocene. Our Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the compiled IPWP SST records indicates two dominant modes of spatio-temporal variability of surface hydrographes in the IPWP that are attributed to a combined effect of orbital and solar forcing, with expressions analogous to the Indian ocean basin-wide mode (IOBM) and the Indian Ocean dipole model (IOD).","SST,Quaternary,Indo-Pacific warm pool,Mg/Ca,Organic biomarker,TEX,Surface circulation,Monsoon,"

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"

"time series analyses of tree ring chronologies from pacific north america: evidence for sub-century climate oscillations","1999","Tree ring-width chronologies from the west coast of North America were obtained from on-line data archives, maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data covered the period 1650–1983, for trees sampled at 43 sites between Dawson Creek, British Columbia (55°N) and Yosemite Park, CA (37°N). These time series were analyzed using Fourier transformation methods. Spyglass Transform software allowed the resulting power spectra to be stacked and compared, based on characteristics such as topography and continentality, latitude and species ecological niche. Results suggested that several regular or quasi-regular cycles are occurring over various time periods. There are some similarities, though not an exact match, with El Niño periodicities noted by earlier authors. These patterns appear to be widespread, affecting trees at various elevations and distances from the coast, and from different species. A separate analysis of the oldest trees revealed sub-century cycles. In particular, the longer fluctuations at 50–65 years are consistent with recent findings on north Pacific climate by other authors. A Euclidean cluster analysis of individual years identified unusual year groupings between 1924–1946, a period associated with positive temperature anomalies and generally higher precipitation. These findings appear to be consistent with other basin-scale climate cycles, like the Southern Oscillation, and the recently-proposed Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation (PDO).","Power spectra,El Niño,Pacific basin,Dendrochronology,Tree rings,Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation,Climate oscillations,"

These two frameworks combine unsupervised deep learning and clustering, taking into account both temporal factors and spatial factors. Firstly, the traffic flow time series data is encoded by graph attention auto-encoder, with graph structure and content considered. Secondly, the normalized cut method is used to partition the transportation network into several homogeneous sub-networks. DeepCut encodes the input data by a simple encoder, and the normalized cut method is used to partition the transportation network. The proposed methods are verified by a numerical example, which demonstrates the rationality and effectiveness of GATC and DeepCut for transportation network partition.","Auto-encoder,Transportation network partition,Graph attention,Clustering,"

In this paper, we investigate a novel federated deep learning approach to urban traffic flow forecasting that graph learning, and trusted authority mechanism. The road network is first pre-processed to eliminate the noise from the traffic data. Next, detecting anomalous features is performed to prune irrelevant edges and patterns. The generated graph is then utilized to learn a graph convolutional neural network for calculating the future city’s traffic flow. We extensive evaluate our federated learning-based framework, where a case study on predicting the future traffic flows has been carried out using multiple datasets. We examine it with different baseline techniques as well. The findings show that the suggested framework greatly outperforms the baseline methods, particularly when the graph has a lot of nodes. Importantly, our approach is the first one that integrates trusted authority principle in federated learning and, by doing so, it is able to efficiently secure model data.

"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces.

"mkcl: medical knowledge with contrastive learning model for radiology report generation","2023","Automatic radiology report generation has the potential to alert inexperienced radiologists to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses and improve healthcare delivery efficiency by reducing the documentation workload of radiologists. Motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. However, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. Additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge with Contrastive Learning model (MKCL) to enhance radiology report generation. The proposed model MKCL uses IU Medical Knowledge Graph (IU-MKG) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. In particular, we design Knowledge Enhanced Attention (KEA), which integrates the IU-MKG and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias.

"mediterranean tropical-like cyclones: impacts and composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic patterns","2018","In the Mediterranean region, a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by gale winds, severe precipitation, and low pressure center, accompanied with a spiral pattern of thunderstorms, is occasionally observed. These tropical-like cyclones (TLC), known as Medicanes or Mediterranean ‘hurricanes’, have similar characteristics with hurricanes and a significant amount of research has been done in recent years to investigate their atmospheric characteristics and impacts. The Laboratory of Climatology and Atmospheric Environment (LACAE), National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, has established a systematic effort since 2009, to document the impact of severe atmospheric phenomena (e.g. medicanes, cyclones, tornadoes, waterspouts), especially over the eastern Mediterranean region. The objective of this study is to discuss on one hand, the intra annual and inter annual distribution of medicanes along with the composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic conditions and instability indices at the middle and lower troposphere, sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) as well, during medicane days, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data sets. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of medicane impacts over Mediterranean region with respect to period from 1969 to 2014, is illustrated by utilizing the Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The findings shed light on the high activity of medicanes during autumn and winter with maxima in September, decreasing thereafter with a long tail extending in spring and minimizing in summer. The average number of the selected medicanes is 1.4±1.3 events per year while their inter-annual variability is remarkable, although there is not any statistically significant trend (95% confidence level) within the examined period. We found from the analysis of the composite daily anomalies of the synoptic conditions that medicanes initiate and further develop in Mediterranean regions where cold air intrusions appear in the upper atmosphere associated with warm sea waters. Last but not least, the impacts of medicanes over coastal areas, including infrastructure damage and casualties due to associated strong winds, heavy rainfall, and in rare cases, tornadoes, are well presented, indicating the high concern of such extreme atmospheric phenomena should be given by stake holders towards resilience of the society.","Tropical-like cyclones,Medicanes,Mediterranean,NCEP-NCAR reanalysis,Composite means and anomalies,Impacts,"
"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"
"assessment of tree and crown heights of a maritime pine forest at plot level using a fullwaveform ultraviolet lidar prototype","2010","This study aims to determine the potential of a new lidar prototype with an ultraviolet laser and a medium footprint for retrieving forest parameters. The lidar is embedded on an ultra-light aircraft. The choice of the Landes forest in southwestern France as study area was made regarding the flat topography of the area and the stand height consistency. We chose three plots from different stands (different height characteristics) and compared the lidar derived metries to field measurements. To derive metries from lidar data, we summed the lidar waveforms within a plot and calculated derived reflectance profiles to correct the lidar signal from the occlusion effect. We then retrieve plot mean total and mean crown base heights measurement from reflectance profiles. We obtain a good consistency of the lidar measurements compared to field measurements, even if we noticed the existence of a 5 to 10% bias probably linked to the lidar sampling strategy.","crown height,vegetation mapping,maritime pine forest,sampling methods,topography (Earth),signal analysis,Landes forest,ultralight aircraft,tree height,lidar,optical radar,lidar data,Decision support systems,height measurement,southwestern France,forestry,remote sensing by radar,topography,aerosols,fullwaveform ultraviolet lidar prototype,"
"on the seasonal variability and the spatial distribution of lightning activity over the broader greek area and their connection to atmospheric circulation","2018","The spatio-temporal regime of lightning strokes over the broader Greek area is studied using 15-day ZEUS cloud-to-ground lightning data for a 10-year period (2005–14). The multivariate statistical method Factor Analysis (S-mode and T-mode) is applied on the mean intra-annual variation of lightning in order to reveal: i) the main modes of intra-annual variation of lighting activity that correspond to specific sub-regions of the Greek area and ii) the main characteristic patterns of strokes prevailing during specific periods of the year (“seasons”). According to the results there are three main modes of intra-annual variation: a) the continental one with maximum lightning activity in early summer, b) the Ionian Sea one with maximum in early autumn and c) the Aegean Sea one with maxima in middle autumn and late May. Also, according to the patterns of strokes, three main “seasons” are found: a) the summer one (early May–middle August) with highest lightning activity over the continental regions of the country due to the atmospheric instability associated with the intense land heating and the persistence of cool upper air masses, b) the winter one (middle December–middle February) with the maximum of lightning activity over the sea where instability is high due to the frequent prevalence of cold air masses over the warm sea-surface and the associated passages of Mediterranean depressions and c) the autumn one (early September–middle October) with maximum over northwestern Greece associated with the early cold season low pressure systems, the warm sea body of Ionian Sea and the essential role of topography.",""
"quantitative analysis of thermographic data through different algorithms","2018","Pulsed thermography is commonly used as non-destructive technique for evaluating defects within materials and components. However, raw thermal imaging data are usually not suitable for quantitative evaluation of defects. It was necessary to process the raw thermal data acquired to obtain a series of satisfactory results for a correct and quantitative material evaluation. In the last years, many data processing algorithms have been developed and each of them provide enhanced detection and sizing of flaws. In this work, starting from the same brief pulsed thermographic test carried out on an aluminium specimen with twenty flat bottom holes of known nominal size, different algorithms have been compared. The algorithms used have been: Pulsed Phase Thermography (PPT), Slope, Correlation Coefficient (R2), Thermal Signal Reconstruction (TSR), Principal Component Analysis (PCT). By analysing the results obtained using different approaches, it was possible to focus on the advantages, disadvantages and sensitivity of the various thermographic algorithms implemented.","Algorithm,PCT,Slope,Pulsed thermography,PPT,TSR,R,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"
"potential hot spots contaminated with exogenous, rare earth elements originating from e-waste dismantling and recycling","2022","Dismantling and recycling e-waste has been recognized as a potential emission source of rare earth elements (REEs). However, the presence of REEs in typical regional soils has yet to be studied. Given the potential health implications of such soil contamination, it is vital to study the characteristics, spatial distribution, and pollution level of REEs caused by e-waste dismantling as well as determine the influencing mechanism. This study focused on Guiyu Town as an example site, which is a typical e-waste dismantling base. From the site, 39 topsoil samples of different types were collected according to grid distribution points. Soil profiles were also collected in the dismantling and non-dismantling areas. The REE characteristic parameters showed that the REE distribution was abnormal and was affected by multiple factors. The results of the integrated pollution index showed that approximately 61.5% of soil samples were considered to be lightly polluted. Spatial distribution and correlation analysis showed that hot spots of REE-polluted soil coincided with known, main pollution sources. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation (p ≤0.05) between the REE concentration and the distance from the pollution source. E-waste disassembly and recycling greatly affect the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding soil as well as downward migration areas. In the disassembly area, REE accumulated more easily in the surface layer (0–20 cm). Geographical detector results showed that distance factor was the main contribution factor for both light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth element (HREE) (q = 34.59% and 53.33%, respectively). REE distribution in soil was nonlinear enhanced by different factors. Taken together, these results showed that e-waste disassembling and recycling not only directly affected the spatial distribution of REEs, but that their distribution was also affected by land use type and soil properties.","Influencing mechanism,Hot spot,E-waste,Anthropogenic REE,Factor contribution,"
"research on oil transportation network of maritime silk road based on big data","2020","With the increasing demand for oil in various countries, the study of the spatial pattern of maritime oil transportation become the new focus. Based on the AIS trajectory data of 2014, this paper constructs the oil transportation network of the MSR and analyzes the topological structure and spatial pattern of the oil transportation network of the MSR by applying the complex network theory. The study finds: The oil transportation network of the MSR exhibits the characteristics of the small-world and scale-free as a whole; The space difference of degree and degree distribution is large, and the network centrality shows a trend of decreasing scale and stratification; In the oil transport network, the ports who have the three largest centralities are all the Jurong Port, which has the highest overall centrality and is in the absolute core position; The top 10 ports of the three centralities are basically similar, with only a slight difference in the position order.

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in european seas","2011","Society’s needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.",""

"comparison of new technologies for data exchange in the maritime hf frequency band","2013","Recently, the use of HF radiotelex on ships, as the only terrestrial communication system for data exchange has been kept to a minimum, and the need for alternative systems, which would use the existing HF communication channels to exchange data between ships and end users on land, arose. Satellite communication systems represent the main aid for the exchange of large amounts of data with high transmission rates, but at high costs of equipment and services. Hence, there is the need to explore new, simpler and cheaper technologies for data exchange, which could be an alternative or a substitute for the existing radiotelex system. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the two systems, which could easily replace the existing maritime NBDP (Narrow-Band Direct Printing) telegraphy, has been done. One of the systems is based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) protocol, while the other, on the PACTOR-III protocol.

"passive microwave remote and in situ measurements of artic and subarctic snow covers in alaska","1991","Between 11 and 19 March 1988, airborne and satellite passive microwave measurements were acquired simultaneously with ground measurements of depth, density and stratigraphy of the snow in central and northern Alaska. Five aircraft flights were flown along a north-south transect between about 147 ° W and 152 ° W, and extending from about 63° N (south of Fairbanks, Alaska) to the Arctic Ocean coastline, with an Aircraft Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) on-board operating at 92 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, and 18 GHz. Passive microwave data from the satellite-borne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), operating at 85.5 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, 18 GHz, and 10 GHz, were obtained concurrently. A good correspondence in brightness temperature (TB) trends between the aircraft and satellite data was found. However, an expected inverse correlation between depth hoar thickness and TB was not found to be strong. A persistent TB minimum in both the aircraft and the satellite data was detected along the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. In an area located at about 68° 50'N, 149° 20'W, the TB as recorded from the aircraft microwave sensor dropped by 55 K. Satellite microwave measurements showed a TB decrease of up to 45 K at approximately the same location. Snow pit measurements did not reveal notable differences in snow characteristics or depth in this location. An examination of passive microwave satellite data from 1978 to 1987 revealed that similar low latewinter TB values were found in approximately the same locations as those observed in March 1988. According to the satellite data, the zone of low TB develops as the snow deepens, and reaches the lowest values in March or April each year. The cause of this TB minimum is unknown but thought to be related to snow stratigraphy. The observed difficulty in relating the ground measurements to data collected using aircraft and satellite passive microwave sensors is attributed to the fact that the snow depth and character are highly variable in central and northern Alaska. This variability is exemplified in the field measurements as well as in the passive microwave measurements.",""

"long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using landsat images and deep learning","2023","Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.","Landsat,WST,Surface thermal plume,Deep learning,Thermal infrared remote sensing,Nuclear power plants,"
"soil anomaly mapping using a caesium magnetometer: limits in the low magnetic amplitude case","2006","Caesium magnetometers are new tools for soil property mapping with a decimetric resolution [Mathé, V., Lévêque, F., 2003. High resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 212 (1–2), 241–251]. However, when the magnetic anomalies are only a few nanoteslas (nT), the geologic and pedogenic signal must first be isolated from magnetic disturbances for this method to be useful. This paper investigates the instrumental artifacts and environmental disturbances to adapt the survey protocol to slightly magnetic soils. Among the possible instrumental sources of disturbances listed and quantified, the most significant are: 1) The battery effect upon sensors 2 m away (classic protocol, about ±0.15 nT) while increasing this distance up to 10 m cancelled it; 2) The noise level of magnetometers and sensors, which, according to tests on two magnetometers and three sensors, rarely and randomly exceeds 0.1 nT, but seems to increase with the electronic component age. Among the environmental disturbances, temporal variations such as diurnal variation or fluctuations linked to the moving of metallic masses play a major role, although the pseudogradient or base-station methods have commonly cancelled them. The efficiency of the latter is strongly dependent on the source nature. However, the ground currents and electromagnetic fields propagating in soils cause more problems. As a first step to better understand such disturbance sources, uncommon magnetic signal variations supposedly due to electromagnetic wave conversions and likely linked to the railway traffic are presented. Based on previous results, an adapted protocol using one magnetometer and two caesium sensors (0.3 and 1.6 m above the surface) is proposed to increase the signal/noise ratio. At first, to maintain an accurate horizontal and vertical location of the sensors, the latter are affixed to a wooden handcart running on plastic rails. Rails adapt to micro-topography, thereby decreasing strongly the soil–sensors distance variations. Anomalies due to topography rarely exceed 0.1 nT. Finally, a method to remove diurnal variations from high-resolution magnetic maps is proposed. Parallel profiles performed successively are adjusted by a cross-profile. Assuming that the temporal variations during each profile are negligible (less than 0.05 nT), this technique, contrary to the pseudogradient, preserves both the decimetric and the metric anomalies (gain of more than 1 nT).","Marshland soils,Survey protocol,Caesium magnetometer,High-resolution magnetic survey,Seismomagnetic wave conversions,"
"insights into deglaciation of the largest ice-free area in the south shetland islands (antarctica) from quantitative analysis of the drainage system","2014","A quantitative geomorphic analysis of the drainage system on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, has been carried out in order to study the relief evolution, glacial history and possible neotectonic influence on the largest ice-free area of the South Shetlands archipelago. Aerial photographs, SAR data from RADARSAT-2 satellite, field work, a digital elevation model and GIS spatial analysis have been used to identify, map and study the existing drainage basins. A series of morphometric parameters have been studied in 30 selected basins in order to characterize their shape as well as the drainage network. Results in morphometric parameters reveal elongation trends in the shape of basins and a limited hierarchical network, common of a youthful stage of landscape evolution models. Several morphometric indexes (hypsometric integral, hypsometric curves, SL index, transverse topographical drainage basin asymmetry-T-Factor) have been used to study possible controls on drainage development. Results have been discussed in relation to relief and drainage evolution linked to the spatial distribution of lithological units and structural framework. T-Factor shows an apparently disorganized pattern and absence of tectonic influence. However, there are local values of second order basin asymmetry directions and magnitudes, which could reflect a succession of master rills through time, related to the changes in water supply during the deglaciation history of Byers Peninsula. Hypsometric values and curves of basins are also mainly related to a young stage of landscape evolution. Analysis of hypsometric integrals together with T-Factor index has allowed us to establish a possible deglaciation model on Byers Peninsula, which successfully explains the results. Areas of different landscape evolution stage are linked in space and support the hypothesis of local glacial centers during the ice cover retreat process. SL index results do not show the same pattern in results, which could be due to differences between incision and lateral shifting ratios. Quantitative geomorphic analysis indicates that during the deglaciation of Byers Peninsula, at least three areas acted as local glacial centers (NW, central and Rotch Dome area). Changes in index results clearly show a different behavior between two areas; distal areas and proximal areas close to the glacial centers. Morphometric indexes have demonstrated their being useful tools to provide information on the glacial history in recently deglaciated Antarctic areas.","Byers Peninsula,Quaternary,Glacial geomorphology,Fluvial,Permafrost,Relief evolution,"
"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of european oak (quercus robur) in n-poland","2016","Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions form a substantial part of the international proxy data base used to examine and model global climate variations of the last Millennium. However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","Temperature reconstruction,Poland,Temperate lowlands,Wood anatomy,Dendroclimatology,Earlywood vessel parameter,"
"gis-based simulation methodology for evaluating ship encounters probability to improve maritime traffic safety","2019","Evaluating ship encounters probability efficiently is significant for maritime transportation risk analysis as well as improving maritime traffic safety. In practice, ship encounters probability estimate by using traditional observation or field experiments is nearly impossible due to the expensive cost. In this paper, we propose a methodology framework for evaluating ship encounters probability based on an agent-based simulation paradigm. Individual shipâ€™s navigation behavior is modeled as an agent, and their encounters are detected by an innovative geographic information system (GIS)-based intelligent algorithm. We then design and implement a prototype simulator based on the methodology framework and apply it in the mid-western waters of Bohai Sea of China to demonstrate its functionalities and utility. The findings show that the framework proposed in this paper has potential to provide decision support for guiding future marine transportation planning. This paper offers new insights and valuable demonstration on promoting maritime traffic safety management with the integration of GIS and emerging complex system simulation technology.","decision support systems,road safety,digital simulation,Transportation,Safety,transportation,Marine vehicles,Agent-based simulation,GIS-based simulation methodology,geographic information system-based intelligent algorithm,complex system simulation technology,Bohai Sea of China,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Accidents,maritime transportation risk analysis,geographic information systems,ship encounters probability,risk analysis,Object oriented modeling,prototype simulator,probability,decision support,maritime traffic safety,ship encounters probability evaluation,geographic information system (GIS),maritime traffic safety management,Geographic information systems,multi-agent systems,shipsâ€™ routeing planning,Analytical models,agent-based simulation paradigm,"
"green, grey and black: a comparative study of sierra de las navajas (mexico) and lipari (italy) obsidians","2018","Sierra de Las Navajas (State of Hidalgo, Mexico) and Lipari (Aeolian Islands, Italy) were among the most important sources for obsidian trade in Mesoamerica and in the Mediterranean during the Stone Age. In this paper obsidians from these two localities were compared in terms of their aspect, chemical composition, microcrystallinity and microvesiculation. In Sierra de las Navajas, the typical deep green obsidian with a golden hue has been analyzed together with a less common dark grey, porphyritic variety. Lipari obsidian is commonly black, but a light grey variety also occurs. Obsidian of both varieties was analyzed for this paper. Microvesicularity was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation, microporosimetry and, for Sierra de las Navajas green obsidian, through a preliminary X-ray computed microtomographic study. Crystallinity and micro- or nano-crystallinity were investigated through X-Ray Powder Diffraction and EDS (Energy Dispersion System) microanalyses. Finally, the chemical composition in terms of major and trace elements, including rare earth elements, was determined using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The comparison of samples of different colors suggests that the characteristic green color of Sierra de las Navajas obsidians could be related to their relatively high iron content, and to the occurrence of many elongated and iso-oriented vesicles which may also be responsible for the obsidian's golden hue. Low iron and an absence of vesicles give Lipari obsidian its “normal” black color. The light grey obsidian from Lipari probably owes its color and imperfect conchoidal fracture to numerous bubbles of less than 1 μm in size and to nano-crystallinity. Sierra de las Navajas obsidians show a significant chemical variability in terms of trace elements, that can be explained by common evolutionary processes in the magma chamber. However, this variability is also internal to a single volcanic complex and this makes the trace element contents unsuitable to differentiating between the different sub-sources of the same area. On Lipari, our data do not allow us to distinguish between the two sub-sources of Vallone del Gabellotto and Canneto Dentro on the basis of major and trace elements. On the whole, our study suggests that caution should be used for both Lipari and Sierra de las Navajas when identifying obsidian sub-sources on the basis of trace element contents.","Sierra de las Navajas (Mexico),XRF and ICP-MS analyses,Obsidian source analyses,Lipari (Aeolian Islands),Obsidian color,Microvesiculation,Microtexture,"
"ontology-based construction and application of knowledge graph of maritime dangerous goods","2019","The wide range of Maritime Dangerous Goods (MDG) usually have complex attributes and take high risks when transporting. In order to secure the transport, MDG must be strictly packed, segregated and stowed according to the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code).

Firstly, analyzes the MDG ontology and then describe the concepts, individuals, properties, the relationship between concepts and individuals of MDG in detail based on ontology. Furthermore, a method and model for constructing the knowledge graph of maritime dangerous goods (KGMDG) are proposed. Finally, its possible application is explored in this paper. The KGMDG is able to work out the correlation between goods, and provides technical support for intelligent inquiry of MDG knowledge and automatic judgment of stowage and segregation.

"chapter 10 - wine laws, authentication, and geography","2020","Wine production, like that of any modern product, is regulated by a variety of statutes designed largely to protect the consumer but also the producer. This is especially so relative to wine. Because these dictates vary considerably from country to country, only the basic concepts associated with appellation control laws are described, in terms of their relevance to terroir protection. Details are provided for several major wine regions. As laws are effective only to the degree to which they are enforced and compliance can be verified, the methods by which wine provenance can be validated, and compliance with other statutes detected, are examined. This leads into a discussion of the climatic, soil, varietal, viticultural, and enologic features that distinguish European, African, Asian, Oceanian, and South and North American wine-producing regions.","Wine fraud detection and wine regions,Appellation control laws,"

The solutions focus on persistent surveillance by detecting, tracking, and classifying small vessels, and address the risk posed by these vessels. In a series of experiments conducted in the Hudson River, we collected and analyzed data from various sensors and evaluated several potential technology solutions for detecting these security threats. The threats are addressed across multiple scenarios, ranging from man-made threats to coastal hazards, using assets including radars; acoustic and infrared sensors; vessels and vehicles; and oceanographic and meteorologic prediction tools focused on the water surface, underwater, and urban environments. The results of our experiments show that the combination of sensors provides a valuable means to identify small vessels that may pose a threat in a busy harbor.","Satellites,security threats,New York/New Jersey maritime domain,urban security,radar detection,acoustic sensors,maritime security,infrared sensors,underwater,radars,small vessel detection,security risks,Hudson river,Rivers,marine safety,small vessel tracking,man-made threats,small vessel threats,persistent surveillance,busy urban maritime domain,small vessel classification,Radar tracking,port security,coastal hazards,Acoustics,oceanographic prediction tools,water surface,urban environments,radar tracking,multiple scenarios,infrared detectors,Sensors,threat mitigation,acoustic transducers,Security,meteorologic prediction tools,"
"trial results of a new low-cost and covert technology to trace the path of maritime containers worldwide","2008","There are approximately 7 million maritime style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the USA. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low cost, low power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than 10$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2009) of such a low cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Maritime container traceability,Costs,Inspection,low-cost covert technology,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,ships,Containers,alternative man-made signal,high DC power,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Article traceability,Globalization,market globalization,maritime containers path,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Power generation economics,Security,"

"detection and mapping of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments","2015","The paper discusses the detection of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments using a Chirp sub-bottom profiler. From a methodological-historical perspective it presents four examples of recent chirp recordings of verified shipwrecks embedded in different types of sediment environments, from different geographical and geological areas and from different periods. The effects of shallow water depths, different sediment types, recording speed and different (2D and 3D) sub-bottom profiler systems are briefly discussed. It is concluded that Chirps are well suited for survey purposes, producing high quality 2D profiles of good resolution and satisfactory penetration depth. Furthermore, the equipment is easy to handle from a small boat and allows flexible sailing. This type of 2D data is cheaper and faster to acquire and is easier to interpret and apparently also provides better resolution and detail than present 3D systems. Chirp data are therefore of great value in identifying and outlining shipwrecks hidden in the sea floor in survey situations where larger areas must be covered. The overall conclusion is that there are grounds for optimism with regard to this method of detection of maritime archaeological targets.","Subbottom seismics,Shallow water,Hard sediments,Akko,Mapping,Shipwreck,Detection,Maritime archaeology,"
"chapter 5 - time series analysis methods","2014","This chapter covers all aspects of time series analysis. In this latest edition, the material has been reorganized so that it now starts with basic concepts regarding stochastic processes and introduces correlation functions as the first step toward defining spectral analysis. We examine the application of spectral analysis to stochastic series and discrete series, and provide a thorough treatment of traditional spectral methods. The chi-squared property of spectral estimates is introduced and discussed as a means of evaluating the statistical significance of spectral estimates. Spectral methods for vector series are briefly discussed, as are rotary spectral estimation methods. The effects of temporal or spatial sampling on the resultant spectral estimates are explored and the resultant aliasing is introduced and discussed, as are the implications for frequency resolution. The smoothing of spectral estimates, or windowing, is described and the implications of window selection on the significance of spectral estimates are examined. Simple band averaging is discussed as a smoothing method and the resultant confidence intervals for the spectrum are introduced. The concepts of spectral fidelity and stability are discussed as outcomes of smoothing decisions. The needs for zero padding and prewhitening are then introduced. Next the spectral analysis of unevenly spaced series is a unique topic of this chapter. It also provides a summary of the standard spectral analysis approach. The discussion then shifts to parametric methods of spectral analysis starting with autoregressive power spectral estimation. The maximum entropy spectral method is then introduced along with maximum likelihood spectral estimation. Next is cross-spectral analysis, where we no longer have strict power spectra but must deal with coherence and phase. The Fourier transform method is introduced and the practical applications of this method are detailed. Phase and cross-amplitude functions are discussed along with co- and quadrature spectra. The unique aspects of confidence levels to cross-spectra are then introduced. The frequency response of a linear system is described, along with rotary cross-spectra. Wavelet analysis is subsequently introduced as an alternative to standard spectral methods. Various wavelet algorithms are examined relative to their advantages and disadvantages. Oceanographic examples are presented to show how wavelet analysis can be used. In addition to wavelets the S-transform is discussed along with the multiple filter technique developed by geophysicists. Basic Fourier spectral analysis is then introduced to take advantage of the popular Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) now possible with digital computing facilities. FFT applications to both discrete and continuous time/space series are discussed and detailed. A least-squares FFT method is introduced again as a way of handling gappy time/space series. Computational examples are included with all of these procedures. A discussion of the harmonic analysis as applied to tidal time series is then presented. In earlier editions of this text harmonic analysis was presented before the discussion of spectral methods but the authors now consider harmonic analysis as a subset of the larger spectral analysis and hence it comes later. Computational tidal examples are included here. Special time series methods such as “regime shift detection” (including “sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts,” “adaptive Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filters,” and “cumulative upwelling index”) are introduced and discussed. Vector regression is also suggested as a time series analysis method. Fractals are suggested as another technique to decompose a time series.","Regime shift detection,Spectral windows,Wavelet analysis,Cross-spectral analysis,Fourier analysis,Tidal analysis,Spectral filters,Aliasing,Spectral smoothing,Vector regression,FFT,Fractals,Co- and quadrature spectra,Band averaging,Least-squares spectral analysis,Spectral analysis,Harmonic analysis,"

"a story about estimation of a random field of boulders from incomplete seismic measurements","2005","This paper reports on the statistical interpretation of seismic diffraction measurements of boulder locations. The measurements are made in a corridor along the planned tunnel line for the later realized bored tunnel through the till deposits under the East Channel of the Great Belt in Denmark. The investigation was made in 1987–1988 on the initiative of A/S Storebæltsforbindelsen in order to prepare its tendering for the bored tunnel. The purpose was to make a prediction of the density of boulders of maximal dimension above any specified length. The properties of the seismic measuring device and its graphical registrations on seismograms do not make a proper interpretation possible without detailed knowledge about the joint distribution of the primary dimensions of the boulders. Therefore, separate measurements were made of the dimensions of boulders deposited visibly on the cliff beaches of the Great Belt. The surprisingly simple results from the analysis of the data from this separate measuring program are reported in a companion paper. Based on the revealed geographical universality of the joint dimension distribution it is anticipated that the same distribution is applicable for the till deposits along the tunnel line. By use of this important distribution information and of the observed homogeneity of the seismic point source field together with the physical properties of diffraction it became possible to make the wanted prediction. During the excavation, the found boulders were counted and measured. These direct observations on site confirmed that the prediction was quite good.","Probabilistic models,Field investigations,Predictions,Statistical inference,Diffraction,Glacier till,Boulders,Tunnel boring,Seismic surveys,"
"data-driven assessment of the survivability and maintainability of offshore renewable energy devices in irelandâ€™s harsh maritime climate","2023","Unobstructed across the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Irish maritime area encompasses some of the worldâ€™s most energy-intensive waves.

Extreme Value Analysis calculates the expected wave heights and wind speeds for extreme events (1-year, 10-year, 50-year and 100-year return periods).

"gross and microscopic pathology of lesions in pocillopora spp. from the subtropical eastern pacific","2014","Coral reefs are threatened by a variety of factors including diseases that have caused significant damage in some regions such as in the Caribbean. At present, no data are available on coral diseases in the Mexican Pacific where Pocillopora spp. is a dominant component of coral communities. Here, we describe gross and microscopic morphology of lesions found in pocilloporids at four sites in the Mexican Pacific. Corals were identified and their lesions photographed and quantified in the field. Tissue samples were collected from healthy and affected colonies for histopathology. We recorded seven species of pocilloporids at the study sites with Isla Isabel being the location with the highest coral diversity (H′=1.27). Lesions were present in 42% of the colonies and included discoloration (32%), predation-induced tissue loss (30%), unexplained tissue loss (3%) and overgrowth by sponges or algae (35%). The most affected species, P. damicornis (50%), was also one of the most common in the region. No species was more prone to a particular lesion, but there was a significant association between location and the presence of lesions. Northern Islas Marietas (61%) and Isla Isabel (41%) had the highest prevalence of lesions, followed by Manzanillo (37%) and Bahías de Huatulco (23%). Histological changes included atrophy of the surface body wall with depletion of zooxanthellae (91%) in corals with discoloration (bleaching). Ablation of tissue from mesoglea (18%) was also observed. Colonies with unexplained tissue loss showed atrophy and thinning of the epidermis (89%), characterized by cuboidal instead of pseudocolumnar cells normally found in healthy pseudocolumnar ciliated epithelium. Bacterial aggregates between the mesoglea and gastrodermis (11%) were very conspicuous in healthy and diseased corals. Lesions produced by fish bites and gastropods were associated with tissue atrophy (40%) and, in some cases, algal overgrowth near the lesion (20%). No infectious agents associated with cell pathology were detected microscopically. Bleaching and overgrowth by algae and sponges, as well as unexplained tissue loss, are common in Pocillopora. These lesions and anatomical changes warrant further study since their incidence is potentially indicative of reef degradation.","Histopathology,Eastern Pacific,Lesions,Coral diseases,"
"26 - applications of ai and possibilities for process control","2022","Multiphase flows occur in the oil and gas industries, e.g., gas/oil/water/sand (g/o/w/s) in all possible combinations, drilling mud with cuttings and g/o/w/s, in the storage and transport of wet or dry particulates, e.g., fluidized beds, slurries and sedimentation, e.g., as in dredging, in the nuclear power industries, e.g., entrained air, and steam at supercritical temperatures in cooling water in pressurized water reactors. Most of these processes have different flow regimes with varying distributions of the different materials/phases, flowing at different speeds and spread over the cross-section of the conduit supporting the flow, an important topic in CFD studies and software development. These processes are monitored with a plethora of sensors, continuously gathering vast amount of valuable data from various locations with many control loops distributed in the processes with a dedicated overall process control using different strategies, which recently have AI and machine learning techniques in their portfolio. The data from the sensors are valuable in data fusion not only for deterministic mechanistic modeling but also for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a growing branch of AI-based industrial machine learning. Data from process tomography/tomometry using nonintrusive and noninvasive sensing provide big data in real time, useful in identifying various flow phenomena, such as flow regimes, tunneling flow in silos, infiltration of sand in pipes, unusually high presence of gas bubbles in cooling water, etc. In this chapter, some applications of ECT and EIT in the above three process industries are presented. This chapter focuses on the sensor arrays and protocols used along with excitation and sensing methods used in the ECT/EIT modules and then presents some results from EDA as applied in the growing field of industrial machine learning.

"interannual variability of the physical characteristics of north thermaikos gulf (nw aegean sea)","2012","Thermaikos Gulf is a marine ecosystem of major importance, not only environmental, but also due to the various socioeconomic activities associated with the area. The physical characteristics of the gulf's waters were studied, analyzing in situ measurements of oceanographic parameters, collected during 5 oceanographic surveys from 1994 to 2007, on the same grid of 26 sampling stations. Aim of this paper is the detection and description of the main changes (seasonal and interannual) in the water masses' characteristics that are related to the seawater quality of the North Thermaikos. The connection between the main forcing factors and the major circulation patterns is also under investigation. The interannual analysis of the collected data revealed the existence of strong seasonal fluctuations that present significant deviations from a mean seasonal pattern in specific periods. A general decreasing trend of the salinities of the domain is observed during the study period. At the same time, a strong relation between open Aegean Sea waters and riverine freshwater fluxes is identified, factors that significantly influence stratification, circulation and renewal of the gulf. Based on the thermohaline properties, two dense water formation events (February 2000 and 2005), not previously reported, are detected and analyzed for the first time.","Hydrodynamic circulation,Dense water formation,Physical oceanography,Thermaikos Gulf,Stratification,Freshwater fluxes,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"

The breadth of activities in the maritime domain makes it very difficult to achieve an acceptable level of understanding and control. This leaves decision makers to deal with a multi-national challenge that is very much connected to the aerospace, land and cyberspace domains. In order for the decision makers responsible for the Maritime Security and Defense of North America to effectively execute their missions, they require both an understanding of their current capabilities and gaps, and a means to determine the capability requirements to close any identified gaps. This paper presents the Maritime Timeline Analysis and Requirements Toolset (M-TART) as a modeling and simulation solution to address this problem. The M-TART is a deterministic, scenario-based model that accounts for the various states of the maritime event timeline and provides decision makers with statistical and graphical information regarding current capabilities and gaps.","computer graphics,maritime defense,cyberspace domain,Maritime Security of North America,aerospace domain,Monitoring,maritime security,military computing,graphical information,Force,Availability,Oceans,land domain,maritime timeline and analysis requirements toolset,Probability,Security,statistical information,maritime event timeline,Analytical models,statistics,"
"a wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient covid-19 diagnosis via ct slices","2022","The quick diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is vital to prevent its propagation and improve therapeutic outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CT scan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studies employed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3D multiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatial information of the original CT images to train their models, though, using spectral–temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. This article proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV. Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels to train three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral–temporal information of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, it investigates whether the combination of spatial information with spectral–temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral–temporal features from such ResNets using transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes a feature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features and use them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark dataset called SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet have demonstrated that using the spectral–temporal information of the DWT heatmap images to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information of the original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral–temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOV and SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify the outstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus, CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Convolutional neural networks,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,Computed tomography (CT),COVID-19,ResNet,"
"climatic variability in humid africa along the gulf of guinea part ii: an integrated regional approach","1997","The analysis presented here deals with the annual precipitation levels and the number of rainy days a year as observed in several countries located along the Gulf of Guinea (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Bénin, Nigeria) during the decades from the 1950s to the 1980s. The study is based on a set of methods used both for the interpolation and the cartographic representation of the results as well as on statistical methods for the detection of breaks in the time series. It is possible through them to underscore a climatic variability at the regional level at the end of the 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s, with, however, an important variability in space of the intensity of the phenomenon. The conclusions drawn previously from the study conducted on Côte d'Ivoire do not constitute a unique case. Generally speaking, it can be asserted that the whole region of humid west Africa was affected by a climatic accident that is comparable and in line with what was observed further to the north, in the Sahelian region.",""
"a method for maritime target tracking based on kernelized spectral filter","2022","Maritime target tracking can be applied in the fields of intelligent marine transportation and resource protection. The spectral filter tracking method focuses on the adaptability of the local appearance changes of targets, with the graph representation. Considering the complexity and diversity of the marine environment, we propose a maritime target tracking algorithm based on kernelized spectral filter. The spectral filtering is modeled as a tracking framework based on kernel regression. According to graph signal processing and spectral graph theory, based on the description of kernel regression on graph signals, we deduce and discuss the construction of the filter, the calculation of kernel matrix, the solution of kernel regression model, and the prediction of tracking position. With the help of a nonlinear model, it can effectively improve the precision under complex tracking conditions. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially when the target tracking is affected by waves or wakes.","graph representation,graph signal processing,matrix algebra,Feature extraction,intelligent transportation systems,kernel regression,Predictive models,regression analysis,kernel matrix,Filtering algorithms,Filtering,target tracking,position tracking,Target tracking,spectral filter tracking method,particle filtering (numerical methods),kernelized spectral filter,Signal processing,graph theory,kernel regression model,spectral graph theory,resource protection,spectral filtering,Signal processing algorithms,maritime target tracking,intelligent marine transportation,"
