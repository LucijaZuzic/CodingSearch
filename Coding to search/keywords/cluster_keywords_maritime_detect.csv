"vessel track information mining using ais data","2014","In recent years, vessel traffic and maritime situation awareness become more and more important for countries across the world. AIS data contains much information about vessel motion and reflects traffic characteristics. In this paper, data mining is introduced to discover motion patterns of vessel movements. Firstly, we do statistical analysis for large scale of AIS data. Secondly, we use association rules to analyze the frequent moving status of vessels. We extend the dimensions of data features, improve the algorithm in efficiency and import the concept of time scale in the algorithm based on the previous relative work. Thirdly, we introduce Markov model to make supplement for the association rules. The prediction results in the Markov process are further used to do the anomaly detection. The method in this paper provides novel idea for the research in AIS data and the management of maritime traffic.","Markov processes,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Association rules,vessel movements,Hidden Markov models,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Markov model,vessel traffic,maritime traffic management,statistical analysis,motion patterns,association rules,Data models,Markov,traffic information systems,vessel track information mining,traffic characteristics,maritime situation awareness,frequent moving status,vessel motion,marine vehicles,AIS data,"
"generating bunkering statistics from ais data: a machine learning approach","2021","In shipping, the optimization of the bunkering location is dependent on price, deviation from the planned route and the cost of delays incurred by the bunkering operation itself. Despite their potential importance, detailed statistics for bunkering operations at the individual port call level (e.g. waiting times, barge capacity, location - anchorage or terminal) are not available. I develop a new method, based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, that can a) identify tanker vessels used as bunkering tankers, b) detect stationary ocean-going vessels at anchorage or alongside terminals and c) automatically recognize bunkering operations as a rendezvous between an ocean-going vessel and a bunkering barge. I find that the high time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm in this setting can be compensated by adjusting the algorithm to distributed computer settings. In the empirical study, I use the output to describe the relative importance of Mediterranean ports for bunkering and provide statistics on waiting and servicing times. The empirical findings are important for the optimization of the bunkering location decision in shipping and studies on regional port competitiveness.","Bunkering operations,Bunkering statistics,DBSCAN,Machine learning,Spatial recognition,"
"vessel sailing route extraction and analysis from satellite-based ais data using density clustering and probability algorithms","2023","The vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected by satellites have the features of large coverage area and large data volume, and they are instantaneous discrete data rather than time-continuous data, so the data has large dispersion with many noise points. This poses a challenge for vessel sailing route extraction. This paper proposes a vessel sailing route extraction method which consists of the fast Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and the Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF) noise reduction algorithm. The method in this paper firstly improves the clustering discrimination method in the DBSCAN algorithm to separate trajectories in different directions. Secondly, this paper extracts a fast clustering algorithm based on the density clustering algorithm to reduce its computing time overhead with satellite big data. Finally, this paper proposes the KDE-based OF processing algorithm, which calculates the outlier probability distribution value of the trajectory points through the algorithm to eliminate the edge trajectory points with low probability distribution. Based on the actual satellite vessel AIS data, this paper conducts multi-method comparisons and performance analysis experiments. Experiments show that the proposed method has the best stability and advancement.","Vessel sailing route extraction,Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF),Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN),Automatic Identification System (AIS),"

"motion primitives learning of ship-ship interaction patterns in encounter situations","2022","Understanding the ship encounter situations is a tough task, since the uncertain motions of encountering ships and the long-lasting frequent interactions make the encounter processes dynamic and stochastic. If we can decompose these complex encounter processes into motion primitives, which represent the elementary interaction patterns, an encounter can be more easily understood and identified. In this study, we propose a two-stream Long Short-Term Memory-based autoencoder (LSTM-based AE) approach to extract motion primitives from multi-dimensional encounter data without specific rules and prior knowledge. This approach leverages the sequential representation ability of LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies of each encountering ship motion. Then, we developed a fusion gate named dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) to fuse the outputs of two LSTMs and generated the high-level representation needed to capture the spatiotemporal relationships of the interactions. After that, through a clustering method, the motion primitives were automatically extracted to describe various interaction patterns. The effectiveness of this approach was validated by naturalistic encounter data. The low reconstruction errors of the LSTM-based AE demonstrated that high-level representations captured the relationships of the interactions in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Case studies demonstrated that the utilization of motion primitives provided a semantically interpretable technique to analyze the interaction patterns and encounter process, which is conducive to situation awareness and decision-making for developing intelligent ships.","Motion primitives,Representation learning,Encounter situation,Two-stream LSTM,Ship-ship interaction,"
"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"
"behavioral detection in the maritime domain","2015","The maritime domain is important to the security, prosperity and vital interests of the global community. In order to protect these interests, governments require capabilities that provide situational awareness of the maritime domain. In [11] a spatiotemporal analysis approach is proposed that autonomously analyzes and classifies ship movement and possible intent at sea. The analysis focuses on detection of vessels of interest that exhibit one behavior, paralleling or following behavior. In this paper, we extend this approach by proposing a generalized semantic method that enables consideration of other behaviors of interest. Additionally we conduct a series of simulations using simulated and real AIS data to assess the performance of the algorithm to variation in behavior thresholds.","Semantics,spatiotemporal clustering algorithm,ship movement classification,Clustering algorithms,sensor fusion,Spatiotemporal phenomena,high-level data fusion,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,automated identification system,Modeling,signal classification,High-level data fusion,spatiotemporal analysis approach,ships,spatiotemporal analysis,real AIS data,maritime domain,behavior detection,pattern clustering,situational awareness,vessel detection,Measurement,clustering,signal detection,behavioral detection,generalized semantic method,pattern detection,marine control,activity-based intelligence,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"
"remote sensing annual dynamics of rapid permafrost thaw disturbances with landtrendr","2022","Permafrost is warming globally which leads to widespread permafrost thaw. Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1×106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very high-resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at large-scale for 2001–2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158ha, 2001–2019: 66,699ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatio-temporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.","Landsat,Sentinel-2,Time series,Permafrost thaw,Multi-spectral analysis,Thermo-erosion,Retrogressive thaw slumps,"
"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"

"new frontiers in the risk assessment of ship collision","2023","Navigation is becoming more and more complex over the years. The increase in maritime traffic and vessel size is inducing a global escalation of ship collision accidents, with consequent losses of human lives and economic assets worth billions. This is particularly true for port basins, with maritime authorities struggling worldwide to keep up with the ever-increasing ship traffic. In this respect, the demand for advanced methods to assess and mitigate ship collision risk has never been higher. The interdependency between physical failures, weather conditions, logistics, governance and human factors requires sophisticated frameworks to effectively assist maritime authorities and navigators in decision-making. The present work reviews the most recent advancements in the risk assessment of ship collision. The article focuses on new, rising technologies, identifying the current main trends and discussing future perspectives and challenges. The review revealed a wide and diversified range of methods, including machine learning, clustering techniques, swarm intelligence algorithms and others. To frame the methods in the current literature and compare them with previous efforts, they are categorized according to literature classifications. Advancements of well-established approaches and new promising tools are discussed, considering methods that allow the inclusion of quantitative and qualitative variables in the assessment. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of a database of maritime accidents in port areas is carried out to investigate prevailing trends in both worldwide and Mediterranean Sea contexts. Results indicate that ship collision accidents constitute the majority compared with other types of accidents, especially in the Mediterranean.","Collision avoidance,Swarm intelligence,Neural network,Bayesian network,Maritime safety,Navigation risk,"

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"

Through the point density analysis method, combined with the data information of maritime traffic accidents in East Asia, the characteristics of time-space variability are studied. The results show that the density centers in East Asia are near the eastern coast of China and the Malay Archipelago, which shows that the eastern coastal waters of China and the Malacca Strait are always hot spots for accidents in East Asia. The density analysis results of Southeast Asia in different periods show the changing trend of the density of maritime accidents in East Asia.

"graph-based ship traffic partitioning for intelligent maritime surveillance in complex port waters","2023","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.","Graph partitioning,Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Maritime knowledge extraction,AIS data,"

"a real-time data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery","2022","While maritime transportation is the primary means of long-haul transportation of goods to and from the EU, it continues to present a significant number of casualties and fatalities owing to damage to ship equipment; damage attributed to machinery failures during daily ship operations. Therefore, the implementation of state-of-the-art inspection and maintenance activities are of paramount importance to adequately ensure the proper functioning of systems. Accordingly, Internet of Ships paradigm has emerged to guarantee the interconnectivity of maritime objects. Such technology is still in its infancy, and thus several challenges need to be addressed. An example of which is data preparation, critical to ensure data quality while avoiding biased results in further analysis to enhance transportation operations. As part of developing a real-time intelligent system to assist with instant decision-making strategies that enhance ship and systems availability, operability, and profitability, a data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery based on image generation and connected component analysis is proposed. The identification of such states is of preeminent importance, as non-operational states may adversely alter the results outlined. A case study of three diesel generators of a tanker ship is introduced to validate the developed framework. Results of this study demonstrated the outperformance of the proposed model in relation to the widely implemented clustering models k-means and GMMs with EM algorithm. As such, the proposed framework can adequately identify steady states appropriately to guarantee the detection of such states in real-time, whilst ensuring computational efficiency and model effectiveness.","Marine machinery,Maritime transportation,Connected component analysis,Smart maintenance,Markov chains,Steady states identification,"
"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"
"historical ais data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction of directional maritime traffic networks","2020","Vessel experience route analysis can provide empirical support for maritime traffic management. Recently, the application of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data about voyages and vessels. However, traditional route extraction methods do not take into account information such as the vessel traffic pattern and the density distribution in the channel. The experience routes obtained is not accurate enough. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for extracting vessel experience routes from historical AIS data. The method consists of three parts: vessel traffic pattern extraction, channel boundary extraction, channel triangle network construction and hottest route extraction. The method comprehensively considers the spatiotemporal information and density distribution of the vessel trajectories, and constructs a directional maritime traffic network which can effectively convert historical data into information supporting decision-making.","Traffic control,vessel experience route analysis,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Kernel,empirical support,historical data,unsupervised method,Feature extraction,historical AIS data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction,Directional Maritime Traffic Network,maritime traffic management,vessel traffic pattern extraction,information supporting decision-making,channel triangle network construction,multidimensional data,density distribution,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,Traffic Pattern,channel boundary extraction,pattern clustering,decision making,Artificial intelligence,vessel trajectories,Trajectory,Triangular Network,traffic engineering computing,directional maritime traffic network,Data mining,voyages,vessel experience routes,"
"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay.

Second, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a famous clustering analysis method, is characterized by poor self-adaption, which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets. These issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis. To address these problems, a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories. The proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories. Furthermore, the Parzen window (a non-parametric estimation method) and the multivariate Gaussian distribution are employed to generate self-adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm for a given sample set. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved DBSCAN algorithm. The clustering analysis results obtained with the proposed method could provide insights towards better monitoring and navigation advice to help improve marine managerial effectiveness and avoid maritime accidents.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Self-adaption,Multi-attribute trajectory characteristics,DBSCAN,"
"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"

"maritime pattern extraction from ais data using a genetic algorithm","2016","The long term prediction of maritime vessels' destinations and arrival times is essential for making an effective logistics planning. As ships are influenced by various factors over a long period of time, the solution cannot be achieved by analyzing sailing patterns of each entity separately. Instead, an approach is required, that can extract maritime patterns for the area in question and represent it in a form suitable for querying all possible routes any vessel in that region can take. To tackle this problem we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to cluster vessel position data obtained from the publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS). The resulting clusters are treated as route waypoints (WP), and by connecting them we get nodes and edges of a directed graph depicting maritime patterns. Since standard clustering algorithms have difficulties in handling data with varying density, and genetic algorithms are slow when handling large data volumes, in this paper we investigate how to enhance the genetic algorithm to allow fast and accurate waypoint identification. We also include a quad tree structure to preprocess data and reduce the input for the GA. When the route graph is created, we add post processing to remove inconsistencies caused by noise in the AIS data. Finally, we validate the results produced by the GA by comparing resulting patterns with known inland water routes for two Dutch provinces.","data mining,Clustering algorithms,Genetic algorithms,vessel position data cluster,marine navigation,directed graph,maritime pattern extraction,sailing pattern analysis,quadtrees,Biological cells,genetic algorithms,genetic algorithm,ships,Genetic Algorithms,automatic identification system,inland water routes,Dutch provinces,logistics planning,Automatic Identification System,quad tree structure,Data Mining,directed graphs,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,route querying,maritime vessel destination prediction,Pattern Recognition,Logistics,Synchromodal Logistics,long term prediction,route waypoints,Boats,logistics data processing,Data mining,AIS data,arrival time prediction,data handling,"

"research on detection mechanism of vessel abnormal behavior based on immune genetic spectral clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime transport accounts for over 90% of global trade, and maritime safety has been confirmed as a vital issue of maritime transport. Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate, it facilitates the intelligent and automatic management of vessels by the VTS system.","Immune genetic,Abnormal behavior detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Spectral clustering,Duplicato-degree measurement,Intelligent vessel supervision,"
"nonambiguous sar image formation of maritime targets using weighted sparse approach","2018","For a single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR), finite-pulse repetition frequency and nonideal antenna pattern cause azimuth ambiguities, i.e., ghosts in image domain. In this paper, a novel algorithm of locating processing weighted group lasso SAR image formation for maritime targets is proposed to effectively mitigate the ambiguities, which can work on a single-look complex SAR image. In the scheme, the ambiguous signal model using the conventional SAR focusing processor is first explicitly derived, showing the analytical expression of SAR image formulation. The weighted sparse group lasso algorithm is then employed to group-sparsely reconstruct the subimages of nonambiguous and ambiguous Doppler components. In particular, we introduce adaptively weighted sparsity constraint, obtained from a priori azimuth antenna pattern, and clutter clustering during sparse imaging. It should be emphasized that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the azimuth resolution by coherently integrating the ambiguous signal components, which greatly helps the target detection and recognition in maritime surveillance.

"aligning value creation and sme competitiveness in the export of maritime services: empirical evidence from trinidad and tobago","2023","The multifaceted composition and preponderance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in the services sector create unique challenges for specialization, productivity, and innovation, particularly in the export of maritime services. Three issues distilled from the literature are (i) servitization of SMEs, (ii) diversification during periods of uncertainty, and (iii) value creation cluster initiatives as a stimulus for enhancing SME competitiveness, in a circular economy. Aligning value creation and SME competitiveness could drive maritime services export. This paper examines whether SME service-providers could improve competitiveness through value creation and cluster initiatives in the export of maritime services in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T). A survey was conducted in the Leisure Marine Services Cluster.

"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
"maritime surveillance with undersampled sar","2017","According to the minimum antenna area constraint, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems require a low-pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to image the wide swaths in ocean surface monitoring scenarios. However, the low PRF that is lower than the Doppler bandwidth will cause azimuth ambiguities. This letter proposes a novel method of mitigating azimuth ambiguities when using an undersampled SAR system for ship detection over the open sea. In this letter, the concept of range subspectra is adopted to misregister the azimuth ambiguity signals. In addition, a change detection method that uses a principal component analysis and k-means clustering is adopted to detect differences in the azimuth ambiguities between two range subspectra images in which the azimuth ambiguities are misregistered. By compensating for the ambiguities in the corresponding image, the ambiguities can be mitigated. This method is only appropriate for bright targets over dark backgrounds in which residual energy loss occurs for useful signals. Both simulated and real data processing results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it is feasible for maritime surveillance.","two range subspectra images,ship detection,low-pulse repetition frequency,change detection method,azimuth ambiguity mitigation method,bright targets,Principal component analysis,range subspectrum,Synthetic aperture radar,undersampled,undersampled SAR system,image ambiguities,maritime surveillance,Azimuth ambiguities,real data processing,synthetic aperture radar,ocean surface monitoring scenarios,azimuth ambiguity signals,range subspectra concept,Doppler effect,dark backgrounds,Bandwidth,Azimuth,Doppler bandwidth,residual energy loss,open sea,Imaging,synthetic aperture radar systems,principal component analysis,Barium,minimum antenna area,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),k-mean clustering,oceanographic techniques,"
"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector.

"conflict detection method based on dynamic ship domain model for visualization of collision risk hot-spots","2021","Ship collisions have occurred frequently in the past few decades due to the significant increase in traffic volume. In view of their severe consequences, it is of practical significance to identify the ship encounter scenarios with collision potentials for the waters with high traffic density. In this paper, a systematic methodology is proposed to detect possible collision scenarios and identify the distributions of collision risk Hot-Spots in a given area. A dynamic ship domain model that considers the preferences of navigators with respect to the distance passing with other ships before and after the collision avoidance action is first built as the basis of conflict detection modelling. Then a ship domain-based conflict severity model is established to evaluate the risk levels of ships being involved in dangerous encounters. The spatial-temporal pattern mining methods are subsequently extended to identify collision risk Hot-Spots and analyze the collision risk cluster features with time of day. A case study is finally performed using the real AIS data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port area. Results indicate that combining spatial-temporal pattern mining with collision candidate detection is a useful means to identify where the Hot-Spots are and how the risk is distributed in terms of space and time.","Ship domain,Maritime safety,Traffic conflict,Collision risk visualization,AIS data,"
"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated.

"footprints of fishing vessels in chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","2022","The importance and difficulty of large-scale quantitative analysis of fishing vessel footprints and fishing intensities with high resolution have received more and more attention and recognition in fishery research. In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated. It is found that the footprints of fishing vessels in China's EEZ waters have a positive spatial correlation, and the areas with high fishing intensities are clustered in the coastal waters of Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The research results can be used for fishing area identification, fishery policy making, and sustainable fisheries development.","Quantitative analysis,Spatio-temporal analysis,Fisheries management,Chinese fishery,Fishing activity,Trajectory analysis,"

"multi-scale collision risk estimation for maritime traffic in complex port waters","2023","Ship collision risk estimation is an essential component of intelligent maritime surveillance systems. Traditional risk estimation approaches, which can only analyze traffic risk in one specific scale, reveal a significant challenge in quantifying the collision risk of a traffic scenario from different spatial scales. This is detrimental to understanding the traffic situations and supporting effective anti-collision decision-making, particularly as maritime traffic complexity grows and autonomous ships emerge. In this study, a systematic multi-scale collision risk estimation approach is newly developed to capture traffic conflict patterns under different spatial scales. It extends the application of the complex network theory and a node deletion method to quantify the interactions and dependencies among multiple ships within encounter scenarios, enabling collision risk to be evaluated at any spatial scale. Meanwhile, an advanced graph-based clustering framework is introduced to search for the optimal spatial scales for risk evaluation. Extensive numerical experiments based on AIS data in Ningbo_Zhoushan Port are implemented to evaluate the model performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can strengthen maritime situational awareness, identify high-risk areas and support strategic maritime safety management.

"data mining approach to shipping route characterization and anomaly detection based on ais data","2020","A data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection. The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines.

However, some misuses of the system such as identity theft, localization spoofing or disappearances have been demonstrated. The high rate of transmission implies a considerable amount of data to process in order to point out those irregularities. This paper proposes a method based on data mining and clustering methods combined to an integrity assessment of AIS messages for anomaly detection, with a proposition of software architecture for a data processing done both on-the-fly and with archived data. The computation of confidence coefficients and the use of data mining techniques will lead to behaviour characterization with the purpose of enhance the maritime situational awareness.","data mining,Safety,AIS message integrity assessment,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,integrity assessment,security of data,clustering methods,Radio navigation,Object recognition,maritime situational awareness,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,International Maritime Organization,software architecture,data falsification,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,data processing,maritime electronic system,Clustering methods,Data mining,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"
"vessel sailing patterns analysis from s-ais data dased on k-means clustering algorithm","2019","Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides abundant near real-time information of moving vessels in the sea of the whole world and has been widely used in the fields of vessel collision avoidance, Maritime Situation Awareness (MSA) and ocean surveillance. The development of satellite-based AIS further expands the range of AIS and enables a wide converge of AIS data collection, which solves the problem of lacking AIS data in high-seas. At the same time, AIS data provides a rich source for data mining for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, a typical clustering algorithm called K-means is applied to deal with the Space-based AIS(S-AIS) data received by â€œTianTuo-3â€ satellite developed by National University of Defense Technology. We use Elbow Rule to determine the optimal number of clusters and calculate the normalized standard deviation of COG(Course Over Ground) and SOG(Speed Over Ground) of vessels in south Africa area as their features to conduct clustering.

"a novel analytic framework of real-time multi-vessel collision risk assessment for maritime traffic surveillance","2017","Multi-vessel collision risk assessment for maritime traffic surveillance is a key technique to ensure the safety and security of maritime traffic and transportation. This paper proposes a framework of real-time multi-vessel collision assessment that combines a spatial clustering process (DBSCAN) for detecting clusters of encounter vessels and a multi-vessel collision risk index model for encounter vessels within each cluster from the large amounts of monitored vessels in a surveyed sea area. First, the vessels monitored are clustered using DBSCAN to obtain the clusters of encounter vessels, filtering out the relatively safe vessels. Then, the dynamic motion relation between encounter vessels within each cluster is modeled to obtain DCPA and TCPA. The semantic and mathematical relationship of vessel collision risk index for each cluster of encounter vessels with DCPA and TCAP is constructed using a negative exponential function. To illustrate the effectiveness of the framework proposed, an experimental case study has been carried out within the west coastal waters of Sweden. The results show that our framework is effective and efficient at detecting and ranking collision risk indexes between encounter vessels within each cluster, which allows an automatic risk prioritization of encounter vessels for further investigation by operators. Hence, this framework can improve the safety and security of vessel traffic transportation and reduce the loss of lives and property.","Maritime surveillance,Collision risk index,Vessel traffic,Maritime transportation,AIS,"

Recent advances in long-term vessel motion modeling through Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting stochastic processes allow to encode knowledge about maritime traffic via a compact graph-based model where waypoints are graph vertices and the connections between them, i.e., the navigational legs, are graph edges. The resulting directed graph ultimately leads to the detection and statistical characterization of recurrent maritime traffic patterns.

"ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from ais data","2019","Since the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), AIS data has proven to be a valuable source of ship behavior analysis using data mining. It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","Ship classification,Ports and waterways,Behavior clustering,Data mining,AIS data,"

"recognition of maritime objects based on flir images using the method of eigenimages","2018","The paper presents the method of recognition of marine objects based on their images taken by infrared sensors (FLIR - forward looking infrared) using the method of eigenimages analysis. This method is based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method that allows to reduce the dimensionality of the problem of image recognition. The paper presents a method of maritime objects recognition based on FLIR images consisting of the following stages: pre-processing of images from the pattern database, calculation of coordinates of images from the pattern database in a new reduced feature space, calculation of coordinates of image cluster centers, pre-processing of a new image, calculation of coordinates of a new image in the reduced feature space, calculation of the distances of the recognized image from all the image cluster centers in the pattern database and making a decision on choosing the most similar maritime object, or stating that there is no image satisfying the similarity condition in the pattern database. The combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) method with the method of eigenimages analysis reduces the dimensionality of the recognition problem. The original dimension is equal to the number of pixels in each image. It must be equal for all the images from pattern database and the image being recognized. The final value of the problem dimension is equal to the number of image clusters in the pattern database. In some situations, the dimensionality of the problem can be reduced due to the low eigenvalues of the matrix of Karhunen-Loeve transformation.

"spatial patterns of landside trade impedance in containerized south american exports","2017","The paper addresses claims implicating higher domestic transportation costs as a significant barrier to Latin America's trade and economic integration - and the region's inadequate transportation infrastructure as the primary cause. The relative “trade space” for U.S.-bound containerized shipments is delineated via reverse spatial interaction modeling. Reconfiguration and reverse calibration of the doubly constrained spatial interaction model is used to derive functional distances between origins and ports of export, as a means of estimating a Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ) for trade flows at the scale of the continent. Global and local statistics of spatial autocorrelation are then used to analyze the spatial pattern of trade impedance. With this approach, the analysis of containerized flows establishes the existence, extent, location, and spatial distribution of discrepancies in South American landside trade impedance. A large share of trade flows have trade impedance that is disproportionate to distance. Trade impedance at origins is spatially clustered for the total dataset and randomly distributed for commodity segments, and randomly distributed at destinations. Potential focus areas for high trade impedance are identified.","Spatial interaction modeling,South America,Relative space,Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ),Trade impedance,Spatial autocorrelation,"
"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels.

"an adaptive threshold fast dbscan algorithm with preserved trajectory feature points for vessel trajectory clustering","2023","Vessel navigation pattern recognition plays an important role in the research of intelligent transportation on water. Clustering using the data stored in The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a current research hotspot. However, there are three problems in the past clustering analysis. First, the traditional Douglas-Peucker (DP) Compression Algorithm exists feature point loss and trajectory distortion when compressing trajectories. Second, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm require high time cost. Finally, most of the studies ignore the interaction between parameters when choosing the parameters of DBSCAN. These problems seriously affect the efficiency and accuracy of clustering. To solve these problems, this paper improves the existing methods by (1) Adaptive selection of compression thresholds and trajectory feature points for each trajectory when using the DP algorithm ensures the realism of the compressed trajectory; (2) using the Fast-DTW algorithm to improve the computation speed and ensure the accuracy of trajectory similarity; (3) Self-selection of parameter combinations based on Silhouette Coefficient (SC) scores was achieved using the similarity distribution of the trajectories in combination with an improved K-Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (KANN).

"unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification with multi-level contrastive learning","2023","Re-identification (re-ID) of maritime vessels plays an important role in marine surveillance, but remains highly unexplored due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets. In vessel re-ID, contrastive methods are supposed to learn discriminative representation from unlabeled vessel images in an unsupervised manner. However, directly introducing classical instance-level contrastive methods to maritime vessel re-ID suffers from the difficulty of finding vessel images with the same pseudo label as positive images, which potentially leads to inefficient training and unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a simple but effective method to solve such a hard positive problem. Our method takes all images in an intra-batch cluster as positives and excludes them from the set of negative samples when computing instance-level contrastive loss. Based on this strategy, we construct a multi-level contrastive learning (MCL) framework for vessel re-ID trained with the specifically designed intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss along with the instance-level one. Experiments on a newly proposed dataset consisting of 1,248 vessel identities show that MCL achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised methods.","object recognition,discriminative representation,unsupervised learning,Cameras,Unsupervised learning,Vessel re-identification,instance-level contrastive loss,contrastive learning,intra-batch cluster-level contrastive loss,image representation,MCL,Intelligent transportation systems,unsupervised maritime vessel re-identification,pattern clustering,multilevel contrastive learning,maritime vessel re-ID,vessel identities,Training,large-scale annotated datasets,Representation learning,positive images,unlabeled vessel images,Surveillance,Task analysis,marine surveillance,"

In marine traffic applications, the clustering results may exhibit a customary route and traffic volume distribution. In order to improve the clustering performance of ship trajectory data, which is characterized by a large data volume and distribution complexity, a method consisting of Douglas-Peucker (DP)-based compression and density-based clustering is proposed. In the first part of the proposed method, the appropriate parameters for the DP algorithm were determined according to the shape changes in the trajectories, which were used to compress the trajectories prior to calculating the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance matrix. In the second part, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was improved in terms of determining the parameters. Based on the statistical characteristics of ship trajectory distribution, the appropriate DBSCAN parameters could be determined adaptively. Evaluation and comparison experiments were conducted based on massive real ship trajectories in the Chinese port of Beilun-Zhoushan. The results demonstrated that, compared to the traditional DTW distance, the proposed similarity measurement exhibits superior performance in terms of both time and quality.

"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"

The essential requirement for USV is safe when suffered an emergency during the task. However, it has been proved to be difficult as maritime traffic is becoming more and more complex. Consequently, path planning and collision avoidance of USV has become a hot research topic in recent year. This paper focuses on dynamic obstacle avoidance and path planning problem of USV based on the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) and the Clustering Algorithm (CA) to construct an auto-obstacle avoidance method which is suitable for the complicated maritime environment. In the improved ant colony-clustering algorithm proposed here, a suitable searching range is chosen automatically by using the clustering algorithm matched to different environmental complexities, which can make full use of the limited computing resources of the USV and improve the path planning performances firstly. Second, the dynamic searching path is regulated and smoothed by the maneuvering rules of USV and the smoothing mechanism respectively, which can effectively reduce the path length and the cumulative turning angle. Finally, a simulation example is provided to show that our proposed algorithm can find suitable searching range according to different obstacle distributions, as well as accomplish path planning with good self-adaptability.

"non-corresponding contaminants in marine surface sediments as a factor of args spread in the sea of azov","2022","The present study aims to analyze the level and total toxicity of the most common pollutants in surface sediments and assess their impact on the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the Sea of Azov. Biotesting using the whole-cell bacterial lux-biosensors showed high integral toxicity of surface sediments and the presence of genotoxicants and substances that cause oxidative stress and protein damage. Using cluster analysis, it was shown that the distribution of pollutants in the Sea of Azov depends on the type of surface sediments. The relative abundance and distribution of 14 ARGs in surface sediments were shown. Principle component analyses results suggest that non-corresponding contaminants do not exert direct influence on the ARGs abundance in the surface sediments of the Sea of Azov. Thus, the need to investigate the significance of non-corresponding pollutants in the selection and distribution of ARGs in the aquatic environment remains a pressing problem.","Polychlorinated biphenyls,Radionuclides,Organochlorine pesticides,Potentially toxic elements,Sediment pollution,Antibiotic resistance genes,"
"a spatiotemporal clustering approach to maritime domain awareness","2013","Spatiotemporal clustering is the process of grouping objects based on both their spatial and temporal similarity. This approach is useful when considering the distance between objects and how that distance changes through time. Spatiotemporal clustering analysis is applied to the maritime domain in this paper, specifically to a defined area of water, during a period of time, in order to gain behavioral knowledge of vessel interactions and provide the opportunity to screen such interactions for further investigation. The proposed spatiotemporal clustering algorithm spatially clusters vessels in the water space using k-means clustering analysis, kinematically refines the clusters based on the similarity of vessel headings, speeds and the distance between them, and temporally analyzes the continuity of membership of the kinematic clusters through time to determine which clusters are moving.

"maritime ship detection method for satellite images based on multiscale feature fusion","2023","Remote sensing ship recognition technology is one of the important research areas for achieving ocean security monitoring. However, maritime ship targets features such as multiscale, arbitrary direction, and dense arrangement, and their imaging is often influenced by factors such as sea fog and sea surface background. It is challenging for fast and accurate detection of remote sensing ships. We propose a new ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection (YOLO-RSSD) based on YOLOv5, which effectively improves the accuracy of ship detection while ensuring detection speed. It is attributed to our proposed four optimization measures in this model. First, the K-means++ algorithm is introduced in the data preprocessing part to improve the clustering effect and obtain candidate box sizes suitable for multiscale ship dataset. Then, an improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure is embedded in the feature fusion part to achieve cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion. Third, the original bounding box regression loss function is replaced with the EIoU loss, which is effective for accelerating the convergence and improving the regression accuracy of predicted boxes. Finally, a channel attention mechanism is introduced in the convolutional unit to enhance the model's ability to capture ship features. Experimental results show that the YOLO-RSSD model achieves a detection accuracy of 96.1% for remote sensing ships, which is 4.3% higher than the original YOLOv5 network. In addition, YOLO-RSSD performs good robustness and generalization ability. This means that our method has high practical value and provides a new solution for the analysis and application of remote sensing images.","detection speed,sea surface background,YOLO-RSSD model,Remote sensing,cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion,remote sensing,ship detection,Adaptively spatial feature fusion,Marine vehicles,ship features,multiscale ship dataset,Feature extraction,channel attention mechanism,improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure,regression analysis,geophysical image processing,candidate box sizes,detection accuracy,Target recognition,Optical sensors,ships,original bounding box regression loss function,remote sensing ship recognition technology,Image recognition,remote sensing images,object detection,feature extraction,image classification,small target detection,optical satellite remote sensing image,ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection,convolutional unit,YOLOv5,feature fusion part,convolutional neural nets,multiscale feature fusion,fast detection,arbitrary direction,Object detection,maritime ship detection method,sea fog,"
"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data. The statistical analysis on the discovered sets of conflict trajectory is able to provide useful knowledge for maritime traffic monitoring.","maritime traffic situation awareness,maritime traffic monitoring,maritime shipping traffic,maritime traffic conflict,maritime AIS traffic data,collision situations,Safety,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,Marine vehicles,AIS network,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,real AIS data,terrestrial AIS receivers,pattern clustering,Trajectory data mining,Artificial intelligence,safety control,conflict behaviors,clustering-and-detection,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,conflict trajectory,conflict situation,Conflict detection,Maritime traffic data,Navigation,navigation,nearby ships,collision avoidance,Data mining,navigational collisions,maritime traffic managers,Navigation collision,"

First, we apply Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to generate patterns from original trajectories. Second, we extract gravity vectors and sample stop points from clusters to retain stop and move information and to reduce the further computation cost. To measure the similarity between trajectory points and clusters, cluster relative distance and cluster angular distance are proposed.

"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"
"a novel non-stationary 6g uav channel model for maritime communications","2021","To achieve space-air-ground-sea integrated communication networks for future sixth generation (6G) communications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications applying to maritime scenarios serving as mobile base stations have recently attracted more attentions. The UAV-to-ship channel modeling is the fundamental for the system design, testing, and performance evaluation of UAV communication systems in maritime scenarios. In this paper, a novel non-stationary multi-mobility UAV-to-ship channel model is proposed, consisting of three kinds of components, i.e., the line-of-sight (LoS) component, the single-bounce (SB) components resulting from the fluctuation of sea water, and multi-bounce (MB) components introduced by the waveguide effect over the sea surface. In the proposed model, the UAV as the transmitter (Tx), the ship as the receiver (Rx), and the clusters between the Tx and Rx, can be seen as moving with arbitrary velocities and arbitrary directions. Then, some typical statistical properties of the proposed UAV-to-ship channel model, including the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF), spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), delay PSD, angular PSD, stationary interval, and root mean square (RMS) delay spread, are derived and investigated.

"data gap analysis of ship and maritime data using meta learning","2021","With the developments in new Internet of Things (IoT) technology, ship owners and managers can access and analyze vast amounts of real-time onboard data. However, data collected from the ship’s engine and navigation information include various types of errors owing to imprecision, bias, sensor failure, or human error caused by manual recording by the ship operator’s hands. Such abnormal data make accurate ship performance prediction and monitoring difficult; thus, the original data need to be carefully refined through data preprocessing. Machine learning models have been used to detect and remove abnormal data; however, this yields inconsistent predictions in results depending on the types of machine learning models used. In this study, a robust data gap analysis method is proposed to detect abnormal data among ship and marine data collected in real time. Data preprocessing, including rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension reduction, is systematically performed; subsequently, a meta-learning model, which is a combination of various machine learning models, is used to predict ship performance and detect its abnormal data. This study compared the performance of single-machine learning models and meta models through various error analysis methods that utilize actual ship operation data. The single machine leading models have various error values depending on types of data and models, while the meta model consistently has values of less than 5% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), showing a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient(NSE) value of 0.7 or higher. Our proposed data gap analysis framework, including the meta-learning model, can be useful for monitoring the condition of ships, as it can more accurately and robustly classify them as normal or abnormal.","Data preprocessing,Machine learning error measures,Meta learning,Data gap analysis,"
"maritime target tracking from an airborne multi-channel radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small maritime targets using high-resolution airborne radar is a difficult problem due to the non-stationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter. This paper develops a target tracking algorithm for a scanning multi-channel radar operating in the maritime environment. The detection scheme uses space time adaptive processing (STAP) with a relatively high false alarm rate. While this improves the overall probability of detection, there are also a multitude of false (spurious) detections. As the radar scans, the target is illuminated over a range of azimuth angles, resulting in a large number of detections per target. A solution based on clustering the STAP output is proposed to create equivalent point target measurements, with the clustering output subsequently processed by a standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter. Through numerical simulations of high-fidelity airborne radar data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves reliable tracking of targets characterised with low signal-to-interference ratios.","airborne radar,Clustering algorithms,radar scans,radar detection,radar clutter,equivalent point target measurements,STAP,high-resolution airborne radar,Sea measurements,sea clutter,false detections,STAP output,clustering output,space time adaptive processing,nonGaussian nature,target tracking,numerical simulations,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,small maritime target detection,object detection,extended target tracking,small maritime target tracking,detection scheme,signal-to-interference ratios,nonstationary nature,Radar,radar signal processing,high false alarm rate,airborne multichannel radar,target tracking algorithm,space-time adaptive processing,standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter,Airborne radar,maritime environment,probability,Surveillance,high-fidelity airborne radar data,Spaceborne radar,maritime target tracking,tracking filters,scanning multichannel radar,Radar detection,"
"submarine groundwater discharge detection through remote sensing: an application of landsat 7 and 8 in hawaiʻi and ireland","2022","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) represents an important component of the global water cycle. Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.","Coastal waters,Submarine groundwater discharge,Ocean color,Sea surface temperature,"
"spatial assessment and source identification of heavy metals pollution in surface water using several chemometric techniques","2016","This study presents the determination of the spatial variation and source identification of heavy metal pollution in surface water along the Straits of Malacca using several chemometric techniques. Clustering and discrimination of heavy metal compounds in surface water into two groups (northern and southern regions) are observed according to level of concentrations via the application of chemometric techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that Cu and Cr dominate the source apportionment in northern region with a total variance of 57.62% and is identified with mining and shipping activities. These are the major contamination contributors in the Straits. Land-based pollution originating from vehicular emission with a total variance of 59.43% is attributed to the high level of Pb concentration in the southern region. The results revealed that one state representing each cluster (northern and southern regions) is significant as the main location for investigating heavy metal concentration in the Straits of Malacca which would save monitoring cost and time.

"iso-kinematic maps from statistical analysis of ps-insar data of piemonte, nw italy: comparison with geological kinematic trends","2011","SAR interferometry based on Permanent Scatterers (PS-InSAR™) is used here to study the present crustal mobility of a large area of NW Italy, in the Piemonte region. Thirty-eight satellite scenes (ERS SAR), taken from May 1992 to January 2001, were analysed for detecting more than 2million PS on the study area. Continuous velocity surface maps (Iso-Kinematic Maps: IKM) were obtained from geo-statistical and spatial cluster techniques (Hot Spot analysis) of PS “short-period” data, to identify relative ground motions and to compare them with “long-period” tectonic mobility trends, i.e. those inferred at regional scale over geological times (some million years). The comparison was made by individuation of homogeneous kinematic areas, represented in the IKM, and characterization of the boundaries between them (Iso-Kinematic Boundaries: IKB). The IKB were used as tools to asses if the PS-InSAR data on present-day crustal mobility could fit with the distribution of real tectonic structures or field geological elements. IKM were drawn for uplifting geological sectors of Piemonte (Maritime Alps, Gran Paradiso, Langhe) where moderate to very low seismicity is recorded, and gravitational instabilities of rock mass on mountain slopes are widespread. The land sectors have been chosen in order to test the suitability of IKM in very different geo-morphological conditions. Different types of correspondence between the IKM and the geological kinematic trend were found:-a first type in which the kinematic trend of short-period (a decade of years, i.e. the PS-InSAR detection time span) is in agreement with a long-period tectonic trend (some million years) and seem to be driven by well known faults subparallel to the IKB. These kinematic trends can be hidden by the slope movement due to gravitational instabilities;-a second type in which the kinematic trend of short-period does not strictly correspond to the long-period trend, but can be considered as minor-order, uplifting-subsidence cycles, even if in contrast with the long-period kinematic trend. Alternatively, the short-period kinematic trends could reflect the action of deep-seated geological forces or structures, not yet known or inferable (at least with the recorded PS-InSAR velocities) on the basis of the available geological data and models.",""

The study described in this paper is aimed at developing a design criterion that determines the possibility of using the waterway for the operation of autonomous ships. Data on the movement and density of ships for the waters of the Gulf of Finland according to the data of Automatic Identification System are presented. The analysis of vessel density in this work was carried out using the DBSCAN mathematical algorithm. It is proposed to use the concept and term 'knowledgeable' to include sections of the waterway in the zone of autonomous navigation. The involved experts assessed five criteria in terms of their significance: the availability of data on navigation on the selected section of the waterway, the availability of electronic navigation charts, the availability of hydrometeorological information, the availability of technical means of communication and navigational fencing. As a continuation of the research, it is proposed to study many qualitative and quantitative characteristics of both the area of the water area and the specialized equipment installed on it, since the operation of autonomous ships requires a more complex technical and information infrastructure.","knowledge of the water area,vessel traffic monitoring,DBSCAN,Autonomous navigation,maritime waterways,ships position clustering,automatic identification system,water transport system,expert system,"
"hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis of ship engine systems","2023","As smart ships are developed, research into engine management through remote monitoring and support from data collected at onshore control centers is being conducted. However, ship engine data collected from various sensors have high dimensions, large measurement errors, few labeled data, and insufficient amounts and quality of data, making it difficult to determine the condition of engines with complex failure modes under various operating environments.This study proposes a hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis (HL-FDD) method that combines domain knowledge of ship engines and advanced data analysis techniques. The developed method extracts key features of reduced dimensions from the original variables (sensors) through an optimal hierarchical clustering and dimension-reduction model, allowing a hierarchy divided into the top (the entire system combining all features), middle (subsystems and feature sets), and bottom (components and sensors) levels. The reduced key features are used to generate robust regression models and dynamic thresholds (prediction intervals) according to the engine load, and dynamic thresholds determine whether the engine’s condition is normal or abnormal. The dynamic thresholds are able to automatically label abnormal conditions of the engine. Once anomalies are detected at the top level, the proposed method can sequentially search for data on features belonging to the middle and bottom hierarchies for detailed fault diagnosis to determine which engine subsystem or component(s) caused the engine fault(s). Actual data collected by ship operators verify the proposed method’s efficiency, reliability, and accuracy.","Optimal hierarchical clustering and dimension reduction,Domain knowledge,Sensor error,Dynamic thresholds,Abnormality labeling,Duel fuel marine engine,"
"maritime route and vessel tracklet dataset for vessel-to-route association","2022","With an ever-increasing number of vessels at sea, the modelling, analysis and visualisation of maritime traffic are of paramount importance to support the monitoring tasks of maritime stakeholders. Sensors have been developed in this respect to track vessels and capture the maritime traffic at the global scale. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is transmitting maritime positional and nominative information at highest frequency rate, making it a valuable source for maritime traffic modelling. From an original AIS dataset covering the area of Brest, France, we extracted a set of 17 maritime routes, connecting ports in this area. Two different representations for the routes are provided: (1) clusters of AIS contacts, and (2) route prototypes, representing the nominal trajectory of the vessels following the route. Additionally, a set of tracklets (built by five consecutive AIS contacts from the same vessel trajectory) has been extracted from the set of routes and the original dataset, and labelled either with the route name to which they belong or as off-route tracklets. This dataset provides thus some ground truth on the routes followed by vessels and is aimed at testing and validating vessel-to-route or track-to-route association algorithms.","Track-to-route association,Vessel-to-route association,Route prototypes,Maritime routes,Automatic identification system,"
"a distributed spatial method for modeling maritime routes","2020","In this work we propose a novel spatial knowledge discovery pipeline capable of automatically unravelling the â€œroads of the seaâ€ and maritime traffic patterns by analysing voluminous vessel tracking data, as collected through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). We present a computationally efficient and highly accurate solution, based on a MapReduce approach and unsupervised learning methods, capable of identifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of ship routes and most crucially their characteristics, thus deriving maritime â€œpatterns of lifeâ€ at a global scale, without the reliance on any additional information sources or a priori expert knowledge. Experimental results confirm high accuracy of results and superior performance in comparison to other methods, with the entire processing duration completing in less than 3 hours for more than a terabyte of non-uniform spatial data. Finally, to clearly demonstrate the applicability and impact of our proposed method, we evaluate its ability to detect real world â€œanomaliesâ€, such as maritime incidents reported in the European Marine Casualty Information Platform. Numerical results show the advantages of our scheme in terms of accuracy, with an achieved anomaly detection accuracy of higher than 93%, by detecting 313 out of 335 relevant maritime incidents.","data mining,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,Marine vehicles,data driven maritime traffic,maritime traffic patterns,computationally efficient solution,patterns of life,routes,spatial knowledge discovery pipeline,MapReduce approach,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,voluminous vessel tracking data,a priori expert knowledge,relevant maritime incidents,AIS,nonuniform spatial data,anomaly detection accuracy,ship routes,time 3.0 hour,highly accurate solution,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,information sources,Big Data,unsupervised learning methods,Roads,distributed spatial method,maritime modeling,Trajectory,entire processing duration,Surveillance,spatiotemporal dynamics,European Marine Casualty Information Platform,data handling,"

"well water trace element reconnaissance, eastern maritime canada","1976","A geochemical survey involving the collection and analysis of about 2000 well water samples from an area of roughly 25,000 km2 was carried out during the 1975 field season over parts of the Carboniferous basin of eastern Canada. This report describes the results of 1721 regional well sites. Three samples of water were collected from each site and analyzed in four different laboratories for twenty constituents. The distribution and relationships of U, Rn, He F, CH4, Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, Fe, pH, suspended matter, depth of well, conductivity and alkalinity are described. The elements U, Rn, He, F, along with conductivity and alkalinity, show systematic regional patterns indicating broad regional belts of element enrichment which are being leached by circulating groundwaters. The close spatial association of these elements over many tens of miles suggests chemical reaction cells or fronts similar to those observed in the uranium mining districts of Colorado and Wyoming in the United States and elsewhere. Their relatively weak character suggests an intermediate cycle in the cyclic enrichment hypothesis believed to be responsible for the formation of epigenetic uranium ore deposits. The heavy elements Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Fe show positive correlation with each other but their spatial distribution is more spotty than that of the uranium elements. Broadly speaking the anomalies of these elements cluster mainly on the southern border of the survey area. Most of the anomalies can be explained in terms of known mineral occurrences The most prominent CH4 anomaly is located south of Moncton and is believed to be due to the old St. Josephs gas and oil field. Several weaker CH4 anomalies are probably generated by swamps and peat bogs.",""
"efficient on-line anomaly detection for ship systems in operation","2019","We propose novel modifications to an anomaly detection methodology based on multivariate signal reconstruction followed by residuals analysis. The reconstructions are made using Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR), where the query observations are compared to historical observations called memory vectors, representing normal operation. When the data set with historical observations grows large, the naive approach where all observations are used as memory vectors will lead to unacceptable large computational loads, hence a reduced set of memory vectors should be intelligently selected. The residuals between the observed and the reconstructed signals are analysed using standard Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT), where appropriate alarms are raised based on the sequential behaviour of the residuals. The modifications we introduce include: a novel cluster based method to select memory vectors to be considered by the AAKR, which gives an extensive reduction in computation time; a generalization of the distance measure, which makes it possible to distinguish between explanatory and response variables; and a regional credibility estimation used in the residuals analysis, to let the time used to identify if a sequence of query vectors represents an anomalous state or not, depend on the amount of data situated close to or surrounding the query vector. We demonstrate how the anomaly detection method and the proposed modifications can be successfully applied for anomaly detection on a set of imbalanced benchmark data sets, as well as on recent data from a marine diesel engine in operation.","Cluster based AAKR,Maritime industry,Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT),Anomaly detection,Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR),Condition monitoring,"
"seaweed and climate change: a mapping review","2023","Seaweed has garnered increasing interest due to its capacity to mitigate climate change by curbing carbon emissions from agriculture, as well as its potential to serve as a supplement or alternative for dietary, livestock feed, or fuel source production. Moreover, seaweed is regarded as one of the earliest plant forms to have evolved on Earth. Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including “marine heatwave”, “temperate estuary”, “ocean acidification”, and “macroalgal bloom”. The most frequently cited keywords are “climate change”, “biomass”, “community”, and “photosynthesis”. The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions. We propose that seaweed production may be compromised during prolonged episodes of reduced water availability, emphasizing the need to formulate strategies to guarantee its continued viability. This article offers fresh perspectives on the analysis of seaweed research in the context of impending climate change.","Photosynthesis,Phytoplankton,Eutrophication,"
"data-driven prognostics using a combination of constrained k-means clustering, fuzzy modeling and lof-based score","2017","Today, failure modes characterization and early detection is a key issue in complex assets. This is due to the negative impact of corrective operations and the conservative strategies usually put in practice, focused on preventive maintenance. In this paper anomaly detection issue is addressed in new monitoring sensor data by characterizing and modeling operational behaviors. The learning framework is performed on the basis of a machine learning approach that combines constrained K-means clustering for outlier detection and fuzzy modeling of distances to normality. A final score is also calculated over time, considering the membership degree to resulting fuzzy sets and a local outlier factor. Proposed solution is deployed in a CBM+ platform for online monitoring of the assets. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real operational faults in an auxiliary marine diesel engine. Experimental results show a fully comprehensive yet accurate prognostics approach, improving detection capabilities and knowledge management. The performance achieved is quite high (precision, sensitivity and specificity above 93% and κ=0.93), even more so given that a very small percentage of real faults are present in data.","Local outlier factor,Constrained k-means clustering,Behavior characterization,Machine learning,Fuzzy modeling,Condition monitoring,"
"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"
"vessel route clustering in the information and telecommunication system of the maritime border guard","2019","The article solves the problem of data classification concerning the routes of vessel traffic in the marine surface monitoring system. For the purpose of this classification, it is proposed to use clustering, the method developed within the framework of this study. The peculiarity of the method is to take into account the specifics of presenting data on the routes of vessel traffic in the information and telecommunication system of the marine security. This specificity is considered in the routing metric and features of the route clusters formation as well as their centers localization. Such data analysis in the marine surface monitoring system will allow the problem of risk assessment to get solved by detecting spatial anomalies in the routes of vessel traffic.","data mining,Telecommunications,vessel route clustering,marine security,Monitoring,Mathematical model,maritime border guard,maritime security,marine surface monitoring system,data classification,data analysis,route clusters formation,ships,marine safety,pattern classification,Sea surface,Measurement,metric,clustering,traffic engineering computing,Task analysis,information and telecommunication system,Linear approximation,route,telecommunication system,"
"advection pathways at the mt. cimone wmo-gaw station: seasonality, trends, and influence on atmospheric composition","2020","Relationships are analysed between advection pathways and atmospheric composition at the high-mountain station of Mt. Cimone (Italy), between 1998 and 2011. Back-trajectory cluster analysis identifies eight main advection pathways. A connection is demonstrated between the seasonality of airmass transport and atmospheric composition. Temporal trends and correlation of variables, flow types and teleconnection indices show, among other, decreasing trends of 210Pb (a radionuclide of crustal origin; −0.008 mBq m−3 year−1) as well as PM10 (−0.15 μg m−3 year−1), indicating that previously observed downward PM10 trends in Europe may actually be attributable to a combination of meteorological factors and decreasing anthropogenic emissions. The detection of a positive (negative) correlation of these tracers with Western (Arctic) air masses, showing significant downward (upward) trends at the study site, further confirms our findings. Lastly, relationships between teleconnection indices and atmospheric transport types/atmospheric variables are further analysed, focusing on large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and regional low-frequency atmospheric circulation pathways, the Mediterranean Oscillation and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation. The analysis reveals the important influence of such regional indices on the advection pathways.","Atmospheric radiotracers,Aerosol,Back-trajectories,Teleconnection,Trends,"
"aerosols optical and radiative properties in indonesia based on aeronet version 3","2022","Heterogeneity in seasonal aerosol types due to different sources, local characteristics, and meteorology lead to different optical and radiative properties from one place to another. This study analyzes the long-term averages of aerosol optical and radiative properties obtained by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) version 3 at four sites in Indonesia representing fire prone areas (Palangka Raya, Pontianak, Jambi: 2012–2020), and urban-industrial (Bandung: 2009–2018). We examined the seasonal variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV), and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) combined with meteorological parameters at these Indonesian sites. Multiple clustering techniques from different relationships among various aerosol optical and radiative parameters was employed to further study the aerosol type in respect to different seasonality. The results exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern at all sites except Bandung, whereas AOD increased owing to forest and peat fire outbreaks during the dry season. The trend in AOD annual depicts an increase in Bandung as emission from urban/industrial increases episodically, while it depicts a decrease at the three biomass burning sites. As AOD increased, Palangka Raya, Pontianak, and Jambi exhibited wider ranges of observed AE (1.2–1.8) and high FMF (>0.8) in the dry burning period (June to October). On the other hand, Bandung has more aerosol distribution in the range of FMF values 0.6–1 and AE 1–1.6, compared with other sites, suggesting contribution of complex aerosol emission from different sources and likely due to the formation of secondary aerosol production from trace gases. Palangka Raya, Pontianak, and Jambi exhibited non-absorbing characteristics, as indicated by high SSA (>0.95), high FMF, and high EAE values (1.2–1.7) with no discrepancy in seasonal patterns, implying that biomass burning aerosols in Indonesia tend to cool the atmosphere with strong scattering rather than absorbing. At Bandung, aerosols mixed with slightly absorbing and non-absorbing aerosols owing to urban and industrial emissions. This study lays a foundation for further research on the contribution of aerosol radiative forcing to climate within the complex aerosol and cloud environments in Indonesia.","AERONET,Absorbing aerosol,Indonesia,Aerosol optical depth,Single Scattering Albedo,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"a novel hybrid approach for detecting abnormal vessel behavior in maritime traffic","2023","The Abnormal Behavior Detection of Vessels (ABVD) is crucial for enhancing Vesselsâ€™ situational awareness as well as achieving effective management of maritime traffic. Clustering algorithms are extensively employed for ABVD tasks, however, they are not only time-consuming but also frequently inaccurate when dealing with complex and dynamic vessel trajectory detection tasks. To address the above problems, we propose a novel hybrid approach, CSDLSTM(Course/Speed-DBSCAN and LSTM), which combines Density-based Clustering(DBSCAN) and long short-term memory networks to improve the efficiency of ABVD. Specifically, a three-dimensional CS-DBSCAN (Course/Speed-DBSCAN) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates speed and course features along with geospatial information in the clustering process to accurately describe vessel behavior. In addition, the clustering results are used as traffic patterns to train the LSTM predictor for real-time maritime anomaly detection. Experiments conducted on real AIS datasets demonstrate that the CSD-LSTM method has greater precision and efficiency in ABVD.","Traffic control,Transportation,Clustering algorithms,LSTM,Prediction algorithms,CS-DBSCAN,Sensitivity,Real-time systems,Heuristic algorithms,abnormal vessel behavior,"
