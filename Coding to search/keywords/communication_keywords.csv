"dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array for communication, maritime navigation and surveillance radar","2015","This paper describes the development of a dualband slotted waveguide antenna for communication, navigation and surveillance radar applications. Two different slot sizes on opposite faces are designed for enabling antenna operation over two different frequency bands. In this way, it becomes possible to perform diverse sorts of tracking using a unique structure. Numerical results, obtained using ANSYS HFSS, demonstrate the proposed antenna provides two bandwidths of approximately 15% and 6.5% for S-band and C-band, respectively. The antenna gain varies from 12.7dBi at 2.2 GHz to 16.37dBi at 4.6GHz.","multifrequency antennas,C-band,Radar antennas,Antenna arrays,gain 16.37 dB,slot antenna arrays,ANSYS HFSS,dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array,maritime navigation,search radar,S-band,Radar,Slot antennas,Electromagnetic waveguides,radionavigation,bandwidth 4.6 GHz,bandwidth 2.2 GHz,numerical analysis,surveillance radar,gain 12.7 dB,Arrays,"
"radio resource dimensioning in a centralized ad-hoc maritime mimo lte network","2015","This paper provides a statistical model for radio resource dimensioning within one cluster of a centralized maritime LTE Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET). The main objective is to compare, for different antenna configurations and different transmission modes, the bandwidth required to be allocated to the Cluster Head (CH) to serve all connected Cluster Nodes (CN). For this purpose, we consider the average statistical behavior of the network and we assume that the active nodes are randomly distributed according to a Poisson Point Process. We base our dimensioning results on the computation of an upper-bound on the resource outage probability. Numerical results based on Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical model and show the efficiency of the MIMO diversity mode in the radio dimensioning for long range maritime communications.","MIMO,radio resource dimensioning,Poisson point process,MIMO diversity mode,Transmitting antennas,Manganese,MANET,stochastic processes,Propagation losses,long range maritime communications,centralized ad-hoc maritime MIMO LTE network,Monte Carlo simulations,diversity reception,Bandwidth,mobile ad hoc networks,Fading,marine communication,Long Term Evolution,MIMO communication,cluster nodes,"
"unmanned aerial vehicle aided hybrid two-tier maritime edge computing networks","2022","The rapid development of maritime networks has led to the emergence of various maritime applications, especially those computing-intensive and delay-sensitive services. Due to the limited computing and communication resource in maritime networks, how to improve the quality of service (QoS) of mar-itime applications is challenging issue. To this end, we propose unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided hybrid two-tier maritime edge computing networks. In underwater tier, underwater wireless sensors (UWSs) collect oceanic data and upload data to unmanned surface vehicle (USV) via acoutic transmission. Each USV is responsible for receiving data from UWSs and performing local computing. In sea surface tier, each USV can offload partial workloads to multi-UAV via radio channel for aerial computing. We formulate a joint optimization problem to optimize the offloading decision and transmission duration, with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption of USV and UWSs. Simulation results demonstrate advantages of our proposed scheme.","telecommunication power management,unmanned aerial vehicle aided hybrid two-tier maritime edge computing networks,multi-tier edge computing,remotely operated vehicles,Energy consumption,quality of service,Wireless sensor networks,Wireless communication,sea surface tier,Quality of service,maritime networks,computing-intensive,wireless sensor networks,aerial computing,optimisation,Sea surface,edge computing,performing local computing,Autonomous aerial vehicles,underwater acoustic communication,wireless channels,maritime applications,autonomous aerial vehicles,unmanned aerial vehicle-aided,energy consumption,unmanned surface vehicles,delay-sensitive services,underwater tier,Simulation,unmanned surface vehicle,Maritime networks,USV,UWSs,UAV,mar-itime applications,"
"optimal maneuvering and control of cooperative vehicles as case study for maritime applications within harbors","2019","This paper presents the development of a networked control system for maritime applications within the joint project GALILEOnautic to enable autonomous shipping and optimal maneuvering in harbor environments. To achieve this objective, all networked vehicles estimate position, velocity, orientation and time dynamically using a maritime navigation filter. These vehicle states are broadcasted to a central computation unit via long term evolution (LTE) mobile communication in combination with virtual private network (VPN). After a data synchronization step, an optimization algorithm uses the vessel states to calculate model-based optimal trajectories for each networked participant. These trajectories consist of target positions at certain instants of time and optimal settings for the rudder and propulsion units which are used as feedforward variables for a local trajectory controller on each vessel. To compensate smaller errors due to model inaccuracies during trajectory calculation, a feedback control loop is also established. Beside active network participants, other vehicles can be considered as well using data which is broadcasted by the automatic identification system (AIS). This paper presents the promising results of GALILEOnautic demonstrating an encounter situation of two networked vessels and one disturbing, non-networked participant. To demonstrate how the approach is able to avoid critical situations, three different demonstrators with increasing complexity are shown: networked robots, unmanned surface vehicles, and a ship-handling simulator.","model inaccuracies,feedback,target positions,trajectory calculation,remotely operated vehicles,maritime navigation filter,model-based optimal trajectories,optimization algorithm,optimal control,LTE,harbor environments,VPN,local trajectory controller,feedback control loop,nonnetworked participant,ships,automatic identification system,autonomous shipping,networked vessels,central computation unit,feedforward,networked control system,virtual private network,AIS,optimisation,position control,rudder,data synchronization step,networked vehicles,networked robots,virtual private networks,maritime applications,networked participant,vehicle states,vessel states,active network participants,optimal maneuvering,trajectory control,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,optimal settings,navigation,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,Long Term Evolution,propulsion units,joint project GALILEOnautic,long term evolution mobile communication,"
"pairing digital twins with maritime autonomy","2022","Digital twins paired with maritime autonomy can significantly improve an operatorâ€™s confidence in autonomous unmanned systems.

"an analysis of path loss models of lte-maritime for mobile communication system in maritime environments","2019","Mobile users in maritime environments have the limitation to use various data services due to insufficient communication infrastructure. Many communication systems commonly used for terrestrial users have been applied to maritime environments. The objective of this paper is to analyze the path loss characteristics of long term evolution (LTE) system and confirm its feasibility in maritime environments. In this purpose, we developed the test-bed for LTE-Maritime at coastline in the Republic of Korea and conducted onboard experiments for reference signal received power (RSRP) and throughput measurements. The measured RSRP values are compared with three conventional path loss models of free space path loss (FSPL), two ray (TR) path loss, Okumura-Hata (OH) model. The comparison results show that the existing models tend to underestimate the RSRP degradation suffered from maritime environment and there is a notable difference between the experiment data and path loss models. In order to analyze their accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE) for each model is calculated according to the distance between a transmitter and a receiver, and the results show that the expected error becomes high with increasing distance. In addition, the throughput measurements show that LTE can provide high-speed data services in the order of Mbps with the long communication distance up to 100 km.","long term evolution system,maritime,conventional path loss models,RMSE,Antenna measurements,Marine vehicles,Mathematical model,LTE,Sea measurements,size 100.0 km,LTE-maritime,mobile communication system,cellular radio,Data models,field measurement,root mean square error,mean square error methods,communication systems,maritime environment,Loss measurement,marine communication,ray path loss,Path loss,Long Term Evolution,path loss characteristics,free space path loss,"
"collaborative optimization scheduling of maritime communication for mobile edge architecture","2018","The rapid development of the land-based edge computing architecture has pushed the horizon of a new processing mode, which transfers the big data processing from the cloud to the edge side. In the contex of mobile edge computing, combined with the idea of collaborative cooperation, we put forward a maritime mobile collaborative edge communication model. A novelty of the model is the addition of a new level of collaborative edge as a small-type processing center between the cloud and the edge sides. For the sake of high efficiency in task scheduling of the collaborative edge part, we adopt an improved Cooperative Co-evolution Algorithm to overcome the constraints of marine environment and communication costs. In order to make the complex matters simplify, this paper adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy and transforms the scheduling optimization problem into the issue of seeking the best individual set of subpopulations.

"cyber risk perception in the maritime domain: a systematic literature review","2021","This paper aims to present an approach to investigate cyber risk perception with use of recognized psychological models, and to give an overview of state-of-the-art research within the field of cyber risk perception in general and in the context of the maritime domain. The focus will be on determinative dimensions within the psychometric paradigm and cognitive biases, and to give recommendations on further research within these fields. Okoli and Schabramâ€™s eight-step guide to plan, select, extract, and execute a systematic literature review is used as guidance. The search process resulted in 25 relevant articles which describes 24 dimensions of cyber risk perception in different online environments. Research within the area of maritime cyber security is increasing, however, no studies relevant for our literature review were found within the maritime domain. The nine dimensions in the psychometric model, perceived benefit and the optimistic bias is presented and discussed in a maritime context. Cyber risk perception is a complex research-area where both determinative factors and other cognitive processes can be influenced by each other. This can indicate that the dimensions differ across populations and professions, creating grounds for why context-specific studies are important. Further research may benefit from more multidisciplinary, descriptive, and inductive approaches, and contextual studies within maritime cyber risk perception can contribute to develop targeted tools for risk mitigation to enhance safety at sea.","risk perception,Safety,online environments,systematic literature review,maritime cyber risk perception,human behavior,security of data,human factors,psychology,Cyberspace,cognition,search process,Bibliographies,marine safety,psychological models,marine engineering,cognitive biases,project management,Computer crime,cognitive processes,maritime cyber security,cyberpsychology,risk analysis,Psychology,psychometric paradigm,Maritime cyber security,Tools,risk communication,Systematics,"
"application of machine learning methods in maritime safety information classification","2018","In order to ensure the safety of maritime navigation, International Maritime Organization (IMO) developed the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), which includes an important Maritime Safety Information (MSI) Broadcasting System that can broadcast navigational warnings and other crucial information. However, in most sea areas, the broadcast messages are still not pre-classified. Seafarers need to identify the theme of those received messages artificially, with low efficiency and accuracy. To solve this problem, several machine-learning based solutions are presented, implemented, and compared. Thousands of Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) messages, from 2011 to 2017, are used in the training and evaluation progress. The classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy, efficiency, precision and recall rate, and F-Measure respectively; and one of them is chosen as the optimal classifier. The chosen classifier performs well on solving the NAVTEX classification problem, and may further be used in other similar problems.","Maritime Safety Information,maritime safety information classification,Navigational Telex messages,Safety,Prediction algorithms,navigational warnings,marine navigation,Global Maritime Distress and Safety System,machine-learning based solutions,Decision trees,e-Navigation,marine safety,marine engineering,International Maritime Organization,maritime navigation,Broadcasting System,pattern classification,NAVTEX classification problem,Navigational Warning,Logistics,Forestry,Training,Machine Learning,marine communication,Navigation,Classification,learning (artificial intelligence),radionavigation,"
"novel maritime communications technologies","2010","Current maritime systems are to a large extent based on legacy a nalog VHF radios for ship-to-shore communications near port waters, and relatively low bandwidth digital satellite communications (SatCom) for longrange ship-to-ship/shore communications. The cost of bandwidth f or Sat Com networks is expected to remain high due to the cost of launching satellites into orbit and also due to the stabilizers required for presently available on-board antennas. On the other hand, the legacy VHF system comprises low bandwidth radios incapable of supporting applications requiring high data rates. Unlike the terrestrial networks, advancement in maritime communication means is severely lagging behind its land counterpart. MARINTEK is the principle investigator of the MarCom project, a joint initiative between several national and international R&D institutions, Universities and Colleges, Public Authorities and Industry, funded by the industry itself and The Norwegian Research Council's MAROFF program, which is aiming at developing a novel digital communication system platform to ensure the proliferation of innovative mobile network applications presently being widely implemented on land-based wireless systems.","on board antenna,VHF radio propagation,Wireless communication,digital communication system,mobile network,marine communication,national and international R and D institution,satcom network,mobile communication,analog VHF radio,satellite communication,maritime communication,digital satellite communication,"
"robust broadband maritime communications: theoretical and experimental validation","2018","Atmospheric ducts, which are caused by the rapid decrease in the refractive index of the lower atmosphere, have been recognized as the dominant propagation mechanism for long range maritime links. Recent advances in radio technology are making reliable high-capacity overwater links a reality. A ray-tracing simulation model was developed to obtain reliable prediction of maritime link performance beyond 30 km for realistic conditions. A series of static and mobile long range maritime multiple-input multiple-output links were tested with representative antenna heights at 1.39 (Band 3 or L-Band) and 4.5 GHz (Band 4 or C-Band) during periods with various levels of ducting activities, for example, sunset and sunrise times. Measured link performance and observed ducting occurrences are compared to predictions to validate the model ability to accurately predict and explain link performance for various ducting conditions. The test results agree with the model predictions and illustrate the various Received Signal Level degradation, enhancement, and fluctuations that can be expected in long range maritime links below 6 GHz. We also report on short-term (few to several minutes) fluctuations of the received signal level at the two measurement frequency bands during high ducting activity periods. Measurements and theoretical analysis of the effect of ducting on the quality of maritime communication links indicate that both reflection-induced and ducting-induced disruptions are different and more frequent in higher-frequency bands. This work opens interesting perspectives on providing more robust and more predictable communications in the presence of ducting.","Sea measurements,Sea surface,Terrestrial atmosphere,Ocean temperature,Refractive index,Atmospheric modeling,Ducts,"

"communicating at sea: flexible learning for maritime education","2016","A framework for communicating at sea was developed following the concepts of Anchored Instruction Learning Model and the communication interaction in an alternative mode of education. The model with planned real-life problems is a way to develop among students their ability to design real-life solutions. A flexible mode for seafarers was seen as a potential model for learning while seafarers are deployed at sea which could be done online, or through offline/face-to-face if they are on land. In the developed framework, an equal emphasis was given to interactions between students and students, students and teachers, and students and content. The developed model is an answer to the demand for seafarers for career development through higher education and also to ensure the organizations of efficient operations from their employees. Descriptive and quantitative methods were used in the data gathered from models of distance education in the Philippines and abroad. Faculty- and student-respondents were those potential communicators in the flexible type of education, and they were determined as to their communication practices in a traditional classroom setting and with the utilization of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs). The results show how adept the respondents are when it comes to communication and use of ICT which can enhance the learning activities of students and effectively deliver quality education despite the challenges of communicating at sea. Seafarers and shipping companies are not to be limited with opportunities of enhancing their skills because of the nature of their work.","Training,maritime education,communicating at sea,Europe,Electronic mail,distance education,anchored instruction learning model,flexible learning,computer aided instruction,Electronic learning,Industries,marine engineering,"
"joint multicast beamforming and relay design for maritime communication systems","2020","With growing human maritime activities, supporting low-cost and high-speed information services for users at sea has become imperative. However, traditional means of maritime communications fail to provide high rate services due to their high cost and limited bandwidth. In this paper, considering a base station ashore and several offshore relay nodes, we propose a cooperative multicast communication scheme for maritime users relying on joint beamforming (BF) optimization and relay design. Specifically, we decompose our proposed joint optimization problem into two subproblems, which can be solved by the feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation approach. Furthermore, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, which imposes an exponentially increasing complexity as a function of the number of BF elements and the number of relays, when aiming for finding the globally optimal solution. In order to reduce this excessive computational complexity, a low-complexity distributed algorithm is also conceived and its closed-form solution is derived. Finally, the simulation results provided show that our proposed algorithm is beneficial in terms of increasing both the throughput as well as the energy efficiency.","array signal processing,offshore relay nodes,alternating optimization algorithm,joint beamforming optimization,distributed algorithms,multicast communication,radio transceivers,base station,convex programming,Marine vehicles,concave programming,human maritime activities,relay design,BF elements,Array signal processing,high-speed information services,Relays,Maritime communications,globally optimal solution,maritime communication systems,Multicast algorithms,radiofrequency interference,excessive computational complexity,iterative methods,Optimization,quadratic programming,high rate services,maritime users,multicast communication scheme,cooperative communication,computational complexity,marine communication,joint optimization problem,multicast beamforming,MIMO communication,approximation theory,feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation approach,maritime communications,energy efficiency,low-complexity distributed algorithm,"

"application of ray tracing for beyond-line-of-sight maritime communication in evaporation ducts","2023","Atmospheric ducts provide a potential way to establish beyond-line-of-sight (B-LoS) links for maritime communications. Based on the ray tracing (RT) method, long distance propagation in the maritime evaporation duct environment is studied in this paper. The variations of horizontal distance and height are calculated according to the refractivity distribution. Eigenrays between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) are determined by tracing the ray trajectories. Furthermore, the path loss, delay spread, and angles of arrival (AoAs) are estimated. Simulation results calculated by the RT method match theoretical results generated by parabolic equation (PE) methods in the short range. In the B-LoS range, the path loss estimated by RT is a bit higher than that estimated by PE. In the RT model, the increase in the number of rays calculated in the B-LoS range may lead to this case.

"smart-navigation over pilot lte-maritime: deployment and coexistence with ps-lte","2019","The SMART-Navigation project aims to develop a next-generation maritime safety integrated management system based on the e-Navigation concept of the IMO.

"government policies towards industrial innovation: a review","1976","Existing economic theories show that continuing innovation, diffusion, and technical and managerial improvement are necessary for economic growth and international competitiveness in the industrially advanced countries. But knowledge of why, where and how governments should intervene in the processes of industrial innovations stems more from trial and error than from systematic empirical information of the nature and extent of the hindrances to economically and socially desirable innovations, and of the effectiveness of alternative government policies to remove them. Nonetheless, past empirical studies do offer some clues. Differences amongst industrial sectors. The sources of new technology vary widely amongst inustrial sectors: in the costs of innovation, in the relative importance of outside suppliers of equipment and materials, of large and small firms, and of full-time R & D departments as compared to part-time innovative activities (sect. 7, 8). Similarly, the conditions for successful innovation vary amongst sectors (sect.6). Thus, government policies designed to influence innovation are likely to act with different intensities in different industries. The management of innovation. Nonetheless, there are some features common to innovation in different industries. Considerable costs beyond R & D are often necessary before the innovations reach commercial use (sect.4). And the following managerial characteristics are in general associated with successful innovation: a deliberate policy of seeking innovations; close and careful attention to customer requirements; good personal communications both within the firm and with outside sources of relevant knowledge; a style of management that is ‘organic’ and ‘participatory’ rather than ‘hierarchical’ and ‘authoritarian’; strong project leadership; and a strong engineering capability (sect. 6). R & D managers are still unable to predict the outcome of R & D projects to a useful degree of accuracy and, in the literature on methods of project selection, very little attention is paid to market uncertainties. Furthermore, a greater use of conventional investment appraisal criteria in deciding on R & D projects may re-inforce the already observed tendency in industry towards short-term, low-risk projects, to the neglect of longer-term, high-risk projects (sect. 5). Governments should therefore examine whether the benefits of policies towards education and management advisory services for innovation might outweigh their costs. They may also have a significant role to play in financing longer-term research that is basic to the development of industrial technology (subsect. 12.5). The nature of market and production demands. The direction of industrial innovation is often very sensitive to market and production demands (sect. 3). This fact, together with the high degree of market uncertainty facing innovating firms (sect. 5), suggest that governments can potentially influence both the pace and the direction of industrial innovation through their influence on the scale of industrial, consumer and public service demands. However, this potential influence will become real only if users of innovations are able to specify the innovations that they need, or to evaluate those that they get. This is generally the case for industrial demand, but not in consumer and public service markets, where fashion, insensitivity to users' needs and lack of technical competence often prevail. Government-funded technological institutes and laboratories are ideally placed to provide such technical competence (sub-sect. 12.3). Economic incentives and rewards for innovation. A whole range of economic factors are said to influence the resources, the incentives and the rewards for innovation: for example, the degree of monopoly or the degree of competition, the patent system, the level of profits, the level of taxation, and the level of demand. The empirical evidence on the effects of most of these factors on industrial innovation is either inconclusive or non-existent. However, in the USA a close relationship has been observed between growth of industry sales and growth of industry-financed R & D activities (sect. 10). The rate of growth of demand is also one of the key factors influencing the rate of diffusion of innovations amongst their potential population of users (sects. 11, 12.2). The government-financed scientific and technological infrastructure. Scientific and technological knowledge from outside of innovating firms is often crucial to the completion of successful innovations, and three UK studies show that a significant proportion of this outside knowledge comes from government-financed technological institutes and laboratories, and from the universities (sect. 3). If the same is true in other countries, it should be an essential feature of any government policy towards industrial innovation to know how effectively government-funded laboratories and universities provide supportive knowledge to industry, and how government laboratories should be organised and financed (subsect. 12.4). Direct government-financing of innovative activities in industry. Governments specifically finance R & D activities in industrial firms, although these expenditures are less than those for general industrial development (sect. 13). These R & D activities in industry are relatively more important in France and UK, than in F.R. Germany and the Netherlands. In the four countries, more than 70% of all civilian government R & D activities related to industry are spent on aircraft, space, nuclear energy and electronics (subsect. 14.4). In all these high technologies, governments attempted in the 1960's to implement ‘policies for innovation’, involving government procurement, industrial mergers and attempts at European co-operation, in addition to the financing of R & D (subsect. 14.5). Government expenditures on civilian R & D related to other industrial sectors are very much smaller in all four countries (subsect 14.4). Where should governments intervene? A, number of attempts have been made to develop a formal framework of criteria to assist governments in deciding where they should intervene in industrial innovation. They all run into the following difficulties: dealing with multiple policy objectives; assessing national costs and benefits; comparing with alternative policies, choosing appropriate policy instruments (sect. 17). How should governments intervene? Very little information is available on the effectiveness of various policy instruments that have been used by governments in order to promote innovation in industry. Although it is often possible to measure the inputs into such policies, the measurement of their outputs (or results) is more difficult. Nonetheless, detailed studies would enable some such measurements to be made, and internationally comparable studies would increase the range of experiences and the number of cases that could be examined (sect. 18). Why should governments intervene? A full appreciation of the nature and scale of hindrances to industrial innovation, on which governments should act to remove, requires direct information on what innovations are (or are not) being introduced by industry, and why they are (or are not) being inyroduced. This information can best be obtained from analyses of the behaviour of industrial firms. They would differ from most existing innovation studies that concentrate on asking how firms must behave in order to make successful innovation, by asking what innovations are attempted, and why firms are stimulated to attempt them (sect. 19).",""
"experimental study of propagation characteristic for maritime wireless communication","2012","Wireless communication is one of the most important communication system at sea. But insufficient knowledge of radio channel characteristics over sea limits the development of wideband wireless communication systems for maritime applications. In maritime communication, the presence of sea and nearby islands gives rise to multi-path fading. Due to the difficulties to determine base station position for maritime wireless communication and the cost of satellite communications in the marine environment, the analysis of propagation characteristics on coast and sea is very essential for broadband wireless communication. An experimental study on wave propagation in Korea West Sea at 2.58 GHz is presented in this paper.

"dynamic selection scheme of lte-m and 5g for efficient maritime communication based on traffic volume","2023","This paper investigates the technology for selecting communication scheme based on the amount of traffic in LTE-M (Marine) and 5G communication environments. Recently, it has been possible to use LTE-M and 5G communications for preventing collisions between ships and obstacles in coastal areas, moving from a focus on terrestrial users. This paper proposes a scheme for efficiently handling both small-scale and large-volume traffic generated from terminals on ships. LTE-M can accommodate more terminals by utilizing the wide coverage of coastal areas, but it can be vulnerable to high-volume video processing for real-time obstacle detection. 5G provides a high data transmission rate and low latency, making it suitable for large data exchanges between ships or real-time services, but its short coverage makes it unsuitable for accommodating a wide area. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme for dynamically selecting LTE-M or 5G communication schemes according to the amount of data generated by terminals on ships, to transmit data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to decide which communication scheme, LTE-M or 5G, should be chosen based on the amount and type of traffic. The algorithm dynamically selects the optimal communication scheme considering real-time traffic information and network status. By implementing a simulation environment for coastal areas using the technique proposed in this paper, we compare the scheme where terminals installed on ships selectively use LTE-M and 5G communication schemes with the scheme where two communication schemes are chosen randomly for transmission. The simulation results confirm that the proposed technique can process more data compared to the existing schemes.","Streaming media,Sea measurements,5G Communication Technology,Multi-Sensor Based Systems,5G mobile communication,Base stations,Heuristic algorithms,Fire Detection and Evacuation,Telecommunication traffic,System performance,"

"a densenet-based learning framework toward maritime end-to-end autoencoder communication systems","2023","With the prosperous development of the shipping industry, a variety of emerging maritime services are continuously emerging, highlighting the increased importance and necessity for high-reliability maritime communication. Building upon existing research on end-to-end autoencoder communication systems, this paper proposes a densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet)-based maritime autoencoder communication system (DenseNet-MAE). Specifically, the DenseNet module is employed to take advantage of its cross-layer connectivity and feature reuse for the extraction of deeper features of the transmitted signal. Furthermore, In order to improve the systemâ€™s reliability in low signal noise ratio (SNR) environments, the convolutional code (CC) concept is introduced into the DenseNet-MAE using recurrent neural network (RNN). The DenseNet-MAE utilizes the long short term memory (LSTM) to extract the spatio-temporal correlation of data and solve the 'long-term dependency' problem. The maritime channel model is simulated utilizing the Rician fading channel. In order to demonstrate the superiority of the DenseNet-MAE, we utilize a large amount of data to train the network and optimize network parameters.

"a multicriteria model for personnel selection in maritime industry in greece","2017","The quality of staff is of paramount importance in all businesses. However, in maritime industry it is crucial due to the nature of the business itself. Employees' lives could be exposed to risk, let alone that huge assets are in stake, if poor decisions are made. Employing quality and professional human resources requires a personnel selection process that would evaluate the best suited personnel, dealing with the consideration of both qualitative and quantitative criteria. However, despite the significance of the maritime industry worldwide, research is needed in order to investigate the criteria upon which maritime management could rely when selecting their human resources. This paper aims at developing a multi-criteria model for personnel selection in the maritime industry, based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), chosen for its ability to incorporate multiple subjective opinions into a solid decision model. A novel criteria ranking technique based on Correspondence Analysis (CA) was added to the process in order to select the most highly evaluated criteria through a powerful data-driven method which does not rely on a-priori scales. Data was collected by interviewing experts from 14 maritime companies in Greece. The resulting model was validated by comparing its results against previous cases of successful employment. The results indicate that criteria such as trustworthiness, responsibility, capabilities in decision making, team spirit and communication skills are among the most important traits that companies look for.","analytic hierarchy process,multicriteria selection model,qualitative criteria,criteria ranking technique,data-driven method,Correspondence Analysis,Personnel,Industries,Companies,human resource management,solid decision model,personnel selection,Maritime industry,Analytic hierarchy process,correspondence analysis,data collection,professional human resources,personnel,Greece,Analytic Hierarchy Process,quantitative criteria,AHP,maritime industry,maritime management,personnel selection process,multicriteria model,Analytical models,"
"on-demand coverage for maritime hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial networks","2020","In addition to marine satellites, shore-based terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited to provide broadband communication services in the offshore area. TBSs should be deployed only at available sites, e.g., mountains with both power grid and optical fibers. UAVs can work only in the area with fine weather conditions. These practical constraints render the topology of an offshore hybrid UAV-terrestrial network quite irregular, leading to blind zones of coverage. To solve this problem, we consider on-demand coverage optimization of maritime hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks. We maximize the minimum user rate served by TBSs and UAVs, while guaranteeing the leakage interference to satellite users below an affordable threshold. The problem is non-convex. We solve it by using the random matrix theory and successive convex optimization tools.

"vhf maritime mobile communications: a systems approach to serving user requirements","1977","The existing international VHF maritime mobile communication system dates back to the 1947 International Radio Conference at Atlantic City, NJ. At that time, there was formal agreement on the place in the spectrum (built around the use of 156.80 MHz), and informal agreement on the use of a channel bandwidth of 100 kHz. This paper documents the events leading to the development of the maritime mobile VHF allocation structure in the United States in 1948 (Special Committee 7 of Radio Technical Commission for Marine Services). The establishment of a multichannel structure and basic rules for system operation are explained. The paper describes the subsequent adoption of the structure (FCC Rules and Regulations, 1952) by the maritime nations of Europe at the Hague, Holland, in 1957 and by the countries of the world at the International Radio Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, 1959. A description is given of the early and rapid growth of the US VHF structure on the Great Lakes, for safety and navigational purposes, and the expansion upon this usage in Europe to accomplish widespread port operations services. Major steps forward were taken in 1967 at the International Radio Conference on Maritime Mobile Services at Geneva, and in the promulgation of the FCC Rules of 1969. These actions established the 25-kHz channel bandwidth now in use. The availability, after 1968, of low-cost multichannel equipment, coupled with the increased channel availability of the new Rules set in motion a steady growth in usage by small vessels. More recent trends include the expanded usage of VHF to meet increased responsibilities of the US Coast Guard (USCG) for vessel management services and for surveillance of vessel operations. Reference is made to the current use of automation-for efficient systems management and for data exchanges between ship and shore-on the Great Lakes, and to the planning for introduction of automation on the inland rivers of the United States.","Mobile communication,Europe,Radio navigation,Cities and towns,Radio spectrum management,VHF radio communication,Safety,Surveillance,FCC,Bandwidth,Governmental regulations,Marine vehicles,Marine-vehicle communication,Lakes,"

"sensing and automation in the future maritime environment","2020","In this emerging era of great power competition, the goal of outpacing potential adversaries in the development of military technology takes on a new urgency. Evolving capabilities in sensing and automation are driven by a trade space that includes range and lethality versus close engagement and survivability; finders versus hiders; centralized command/control versus asset independence/dispersion; and planning and judgement versus reaction and autonomy.

"distributed resource allocation for general energy efficiency maximization in offshore maritime device-to-device communication","2021","In maritime scenario, the communication service, if any, is likely to be expensive due to the high-cost satellite transmissions or the very limited offshore coverage of terrestrial networks.

We evaluate the maximum range that can be supported for different reliability requirements and we focus specifically on analyzing the gain that can be obtained when antenna height and/or band diversity are used. It was found that for high reliability requirements, the antenna height at the shore is the main factor on deciding the maximum communication range that can be maintained.

"heterogeneous multilink aggregation for reliable uav communication in maritime search and rescue missions","2019","Recent technological advances are leading to increasing adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in more and more application areas. The use of UAVs promises great potentials in finding missing persons during maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions. Hereby, communication between ground station and vehicle is essential in order to exchange data. Mandatory requirements are high reliability - especially for telemetry and control data - as well as high data rates as an enabler for high resolution thermal imaging and real-time video payloads. The underlying paper investigates the applicability of Long Term Evolution (LTE) for maritime SAR missions. Therefore, in a first step, a detailed maritime channel model is developed and implemented. The analytic evaluations show significant decreases in communication range in dependency of UAV flight and base station height and in dependency of the current wind speed. To compensate interferences and frequency-dependent propagation effects the authors propose the aggregation of multiple LTE links using the Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol. The proposed multi-link concept is evaluated and assessed in a close-to-reality evaluation. Hereby, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiment is conducted emulating a public mobile network operator in combination with a dedicated SAR-mission-only LTE link.

An approximation algorithm, which adopts visual attention architecture to reduce the wavy noises and make the object distinct from the background, segments the regions of interest quickly. Then, a modified temporal differencing method is proposed to eliminate the background and detect the moving maritime object. On the multi-object tracking process, an adaptive choosing the global nearest neighbor algorithm is presented based on a linear dynamic model. Furthermore, an effective occlusion reasoning method is proposed, which partly solves the occlusion problem. Experimental results show that the proposed real-time system performs well in various maritime video sequences.","visual attention architecture,computer graphics,global nearest neighbor algorithm,real-time moving maritime objects segmentation,Spatial resolution,maritime video sequences,video communication,Video sequences,multiobject tracking process,Application software,video object segmentation,temporal differencing method,real-time systems,object detection,real-time system,Object segmentation,Image segmentation,approximation algorithm,Computer science,Image analysis,image sequences,Image resolution,Object detection,image segmentation,linear dynamic model,Videoconference,tracking,occlusion reasoning method,"
"maritime target localization from bistatic range measurements in space-based passive radar","2021","In this article, localization of a maritime target using a passive multistatic radar system, consisting of a single receiver and a number of satellites as its transmitters, is investigated. The set of communication satellites and also the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), including GPS, Glonass, and Galileo, are employed as illuminators of opportunity. In the receiver, the reflected signals from the target along with the direct signal from the satellites are employed to extract a set of bistatic range measurements. Leveraging these measurements and the satellite's position information, a novel localization method considering zero height of maritime target and appropriate combination of the measurement signals is presented. The proposed method is efficient for localization of maritime targets in cases with arbitrary bistatic range accuracy. The results of numerical simulations confirm the efficiency of the proposed method and its superior performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.","Satellites,direct signal,GNSS,marine radar,localization method,Glonass,distance measurement,reflected signals,passive radar,Location awareness,Global Positioning System,bistatic range measurements,satellite position information,communication satellites,maritime target localization,numerical simulations,measurement signals,single receiver,passive radar sensors,satellites direct signal,arbitrary bistatic range accuracy,Satellite broadcasting,passive multistatic radar system,global navigation satellite system,Passive radar,Galileo,global navigation satellite system (GNSS),Receivers,Signal to noise ratio,space-based passive radar,Bistatic range measurements,maritime target,Global navigation satellite system,"

"multifunction maritime radar and rf systemsâ€”technology challenges and areas of development","2022","Modern multifunctional radars (MFRs) offer extremely capable radio frequency (RF) front ends although their role is mostly limited to radar. Expanding the role of a multifunctional radar into a multifunctional radio frequency system (MFRFS), incorporating functions such as wireless communications and electronic warfare, has the potential to offer significant benefits. Technologies such as direct RF digitization, AI resource management, and high bandwidth amplifiers could enable a future MFRFS to fulfil these functions. Multifunctionality must be a key design driver when procuring MFRFSs; however, this runs counter to the traditional approach of requiring an assured minimum performance of a single functionâ€”while a particular system based around an individual function could potentially outperform the MFRFS, the overall performance across all functions should be better than the performance of a collection of individual systems.","marine radar,direct RF digitization,extremely capable radio frequency front ends,Radar antennas,frequency response,Resource management,Radio frequency,electronic warfare,Maritime communications,Target tracking,MFR,AI resource management,Radar tracking,Electronic warfare,Artificial intelligence,multifunctional radar,future MFRFS,multifunction maritime radar,Radar cross-sections,wireless communications,high bandwidth amplifiers,multifunctional radio frequency system,RF systems,key design driver,Missiles,"

"a method to deliver aodv routing messages using wimax mesh mac control messages in maritime wireless networks","2009","We envisage extending the coverage of existing terrestrial wireless broadband wireless networks to the sea so that cost-efficient wireless access is available to the ships near the shore. The coverage extension is achieved through a multi-hop WiMAX wireless mesh networks where ships, maritime beacons and buoys are the nodes. In such a multi-hop network, routing protocol plays an important role in ensuring reliable end-to-end packet delivery. Compared to AOMDV and OLSR, AODV has been found as a more suitable routing protocol in terms of average packet delay, packet delivery ratio, and implementation complexity. AODV requires route request messages being broadcast during route discovery process. However, WiMAX mesh MAC protocol is not efficient in supporting broadcast of data packets that carry the route request. This inefficiency is due to need of performing the three-way-handshaking process in reserving a data slot before transmitting each route request. As a result, AODV suffers from large initial packet delay and average packet delay. In view of the problem, this paper proposes a method to efficiently deliver the AODV routing messages by piggybacking them on the existing WiMAX mesh MAC control messages. As such, the three-way-handshaking is avoided leading to a faster transmission of routing messages. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can lead to an improvement in initial packet delay, weighted average delay, and packet delivery ratio.","telecommunication security,Broadcasting,wireless mesh networks,Wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,routing messages,mesh MAC control messages,Mesh networks,Wireless communication,routing protocols,OLSR,Routing protocols,Delay,access protocols,packet delivery ratio,Media Access Protocol,three-way-handshaking process,initial packet delay,Spread spectrum communication,MAC protocol,research terrestrial wireless broadband wireless networks,AODV,broadband networks,marine communication,WiMAX,maritime wireless networks,WiMax,"

"high bandwidth maritime communication systems â€“ review of existing solutions and new proposals","2018","This paper presents a review of high bandwidth maritime communication technologies. High bandwidth maritime communication technologies can broadly be divided into two main areas - commercially available systems and research based systems. A detailed review of the current technology in each area is undertaken. Several commercially available systems use satellite communications technologies. A number of these systems are reviewed and bandwidth, latency and cost comparisons are made. Point to point links, another commercially available technology, is also discussed and similar criteria are used for their comparison, including range and bandwidth. As well as commercially available technologies, several novel methods of maritime communications are reviewed that are current research topics in the marine communications field. Many of these show interesting possibilities, such as evaporation ducting and tropospheric scatter. The main mode of operation of each technology is discussed, and the possible performance for each in terms of range and bandwidth is compared. Issues and challenges that need to be overcome for the technologies to be viable in the marine environment are also discussed.

"a proactive system for maritime environment monitoring","2016","The ability to remotely detect and monitor oil spills is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products. Indeed, shipping routes are becoming very crowded and the likelihood of oil slick occurrence is increasing. In this frame, a fully integrated remote sensing system can be a valuable monitoring tool. We propose an integrated and interoperable system able to monitor ship traffic and marine operators, using sensing capabilities from a variety of electronic sensors, along with geo-positioning tools, and through a communication infrastructure. Our system is capable of transferring heterogeneous data, freely and seamlessly, between different elements of the information system (and their users) in a consistent and usable form. The system also integrates a collection of decision support services providing proactive functionalities.

"safe maritime autonomous navigation with colregs, using velocity obstacles","2014","This paper presents an autonomous motion planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The algorithm not only addresses hazard avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards, but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS, for COLlision REGulationS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the â€œstand-onâ€ vessel to maneuver. Three primary COLREGS rules are considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For autonomous USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obeys COLREGS. Furthermore, when other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV must fall back to its HA algorithms to prevent a collision. The proposed approach is based on velocity obstacles (VO) method, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because VOs also specify on which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space in a natural way. Results from several experiments involving up to four vessels are presented, in what we believe is the first on-water demonstration of autonomous COLREGS maneuvers without explicit intervehicle communication. We also show an application of this motion planner to a target trailing task, where a strategic planner commands USV waypoints based on high-level objectives, and the local motion planner ensures hazard avoidance and compliance with COLREGS during a traverse.","international regulations,trailing task,strategic planner commands,moving hazards,autonomous motion planning,remotely operated vehicles,avoidance maneuver,USV waypoints,marine navigation,collision regulations,sea,safe maritime autonomous navigation,velocity obstacles (VOs),regulation,stand-on vessel,collision prevention,cone-shaped obstacle,traffic boats,clutter,hazards,unmanned surface vehicles,high-level objectives,motion planner,hazard avoidance,stationary hazards,COLREGS,velocity obstacles,collision avoidance,cluttered environments,unmanned surface vehicle (USV),dynamic environments,"

For abnormal maritime monitoring data (MMD), a data cleaning algorithm of sample density-based local outlier factor (SD-LOF) is proposed. It can effectively save the cost of data privacy protection (DPP) and improve the quality of MEC service.

"adjacent channel interference from maritime earth station in motion to 5g mobile service","2018","Earth station in motion (ESIM) service is an advanced satellite service and its demand is increasing around the world. 5G mobile service (IMT-2020) is also one of the most demanding systems in the world.

"artinali++: multi-dimensional specification mining for complex cyber-physical system security","2021","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) have been investigated as a key area of research since they are the core of Internet of Things. CPSs integrate computing and communication with control and monitoring of entities in the physical world. Due to the tight coupling of cyber and physical domains, and to the possible catastrophic consequences of the malicious attacks on critical infrastructures, security is one of the key concerns. However, the exponential growth of IoT has led to deployment of CPSes without support for enforcing important security properties. Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to be effective for securing these systems. Mining the specifications of CPSes by experts is a cumbersome and error-prone task. Therefore, it is essential to dynamically monitor the CPS to learn its common behaviors and formulate specifications for detecting malicious bugs and security attacks. Existing solutions for specification mining only combine data and events, but not time. However, time is a semantic property in CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for obtaining high accuracy. This paper proposes ARTINALI++, which dynamically mines specifications in CPS systems with arbitrary size and complexity. ARTINALI++ captures the security properties by incorporating time as a substantial property of the system, and generate a multi-dimensional model for the general CPS systems. Moreover, it enhances the model through discovering invariants that represent the physical motions and distinct operational modes in complex CPS systems. We build Intrusion Detection Systems based on ARTINALI++ for three CPSes with various levels of complexity including smart meter, smart artificial pancreas and unmanned aerial vehicle, and measure their detection accuracy. We find that the ARTINALI++ significantly reduces the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 23.45% and 73.6% on average, respectively, over other dynamic specification mining tools on the three CPS platforms.","Cyber-Physical Systems,Safety,Specification mining,Intrusion Detection Systems,Program analysis,Security,"

"energy-saving resource allocation with lightweight blockchain in maritime wireless communication networks","2020","With the exploration of the ocean resource, establishing an energy-efficient and reliable maritime wireless communication network becomes more and more urgent. In maritime wireless communication networks, data types, such as search and rescue information, business information and surveillance video, will be continuously generated and need to be scheduled and shared.

To this end, this paper aims to establish a distributed network architecture composed of buoys and base stations (BS) at sea, and uses blockchain technology to solve the problem of the completeness of its decentralized network system. To satisfy the computing requirement companied with the blockchain, buoys and BSs in networks also have the computing ability. Due to the fact that buoys deployed in the ocean are hard to be frequently charged, the energy consumption problem is studied in this paper via the joint optimization of the communication resource and computing resource.

One aspect from this standard is the low emission limit for radio frequency protection of the maritime very high frequency radio telephony system. This limit appears not to be based on a minimum range to receive a distress call, but on the possibility of receiving the lowest possible signal in an assumed placement of equipment. An analysis of the standard and a reconstruction of their rationale have led to an alternative, functional requirement with proper rationale, which can give the system integrator more flexibility in choosing equipment.

"uav-assisted maritime legitimate surveillance: joint trajectory design and power allocation","2023","This paper investigates a novel maritime wireless surveillance scenario, where a legitimate monitor vessel moves around to eavesdrop the suspicious communication from a suspicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to a suspicious vessel with the help of a cooperative UAV. Specifically, the cooperative UAV can adjust its jamming power and trajectory to exactly control the transmission rate of the suspicious link, thus improving the monitor vessel's surveillance performance. Furthermore, since the cooperative UAV cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, its jamming power allocation on the ocean should be carefully designed by the energy thresholds. Under such setup, we formulate a sum eavesdropping rate maximization problem, which jointly optimizes the jamming power and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the cooperative UAV, as well as the two-dimensional (2D) trajectory of the monitor vessel. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the design problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm to find its suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed jamming-assisted 3D joint design can significantly improve the eavesdropping rate and save the jamming power compared to the benchmark schemes.","Trajectory,Wireless communication,UAV cooperative jamming,trajectory design,Eavesdropping,Surveillance,Autonomous aerial vehicles,Three-dimensional displays,power allocation,Maritime legitimate surveillance,Jamming,"

Industry 4.0 works to encourage more autonomous intelligent processes while enhancing customer experience, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability. It needs to effectively process the information from manufacturing processes and networks to deliver on its promises. AI seems to be an excellent choice for managing all created data and assisting with automating and metrification. This article describes the digital twin (DT) as the genuine embodiment of an Industry 4.0 cyber-physical system (CPS), demonstrating the role of AI in this idea. CPS and DTs have attracted a lot of attention from researchers and practitioners as the preferred method of such integration. CPS and DTs can provide industrial systems more intelligence, robustness, and efficiency by creating feedback loops where physical processes influence cyber parts and vice versa. The fundamental ideas of a close cyber-physical link, immediate communication, performance of a system, and in-depth collaboration are similar in CPS and DTs.","Industry 4.0,digital twin,Artificial intelligence,Internet of Things,cyber-physical system,fault diagnosis,"

"maritime networking: bringing internet to the sea","2019","Maritime networks establish wireless multi-hop networks to provide wireless broadband service at sea, connecting various kinds of ships, maritime buoys, and beacons. The maritime networks possess two distinguishing characteristics highly affected by maneuver at sea-dynamic link quality and bandwidth constrained, and dynamic network topology-that warrant specific attention. Unlike land vehicles, maneuver at sea is affected by sea surface movement and wave occlusions, which can cause unstable environment with a high rate of link breakages caused by low link stability, as well as low and highly variable bandwidth. In spite of the need to achieve performance close to high-speed terrestrial wireless broadband service on land, there is only a perfunctory effort to investigate maritime networks. There is an urgent need to refresh the interest to investigate, as well as to further enhance, maritime networks. This paper presents a review of the limited research works of this topic, which revolve around the networking issues in the link, network, and upper layers, in the literature.

"chapter 26 - dealing with space weather: the canadian experience","2018","Space weather phenomena, in the form of the aurora borealis (northern lights), have always been part of the Canadian experience. However, in modern times, we have come to realize how these phenomena can affect the different technological systems on which we rely. High-frequency radio opened up communication links to remote communities, except when the ionosphere was disrupted by space weather disturbances. Such disturbances are now a problem for commercial aircraft using transpolar routes. As long-distance communications shifted to using satellites, Telesat's Anik series of satellites provided phone and television links across the country, but suffered a major blow when energetic electrons damaged the attitude control circuitry for Anik-E2. After heroic efforts to implement an alternative control system, the satellite was brought back into operation 5 months later. On the ground, the expanding power network was vulnerable to the extra currents created during geomagnetic disturbances and on March 13, 1989, a major magnetic storm caused widespread effects, including the blackout of the Hydro-Québec power system. Canadian operators of aeromagnetic surveys and directional drilling have also had to cope with geomagnetic disturbances. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are another technology affected by ionospheric disturbances and a number of correction services have been developed, including the Canadian Coast Guard's DGPS service for maritime users. In parallel with the increasing engineering requirements to design or manage systems in Canada that are affected by space weather, the science behind space weather phenomena has been a particular focus of Canadian scientists who have made great contributions in this area. The same high-latitude location that makes Canada more exposed to space weather hazards also makes it a prime location for space weather observations and the country is now a giant array of space weather research instruments. The challenge for the future is to use the new knowledge being generated to help protect Canadian infrastructure from future extreme space weather events.","Satellites,Radio communications,Space weather,Canada,Surveying and navigation,Power systems and pipelines,"

"deep reinforcement learning based uav-assisted maritime network computation offloading strategy","2022","As maritime activities become more frequent, many computationally intensive applications have emerged. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized to provide computing services for maritime networks. In this paper, a multi-UAV assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) network is designed. Each UAV is configured with a nano-server to provide computational offloading services for maritime users (MVs). The goal is to minimize the maximum processing delay of the multi-VAV assisted MEC network. We present an optimization problem for joint task offloading, resource allocation, and flight trajectory of UAVs. The above problem is an mixed non-integer linear programming problem (MINLP), which is transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP).

"concurrent use of satellite imaging and passive acoustics for maritime domain awareness","2010","The research being conducted in the Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR), a DHS National Center of Excellence for Port Security examines some basic science issues and emerging technologies to improve the security of ports and inland waterways, as well as coastal and offshore operations. This research follows a layered approach utilizing above water and underwater surveillance techniques. The investigated layers include satellite-based wide area surveillance; HF Radar systems providing over-the-horizon monitoring; and nearshore and harbor passive acoustic surveillance. Integration of these systems is aimed at achieving vessel detection, classification, identification, and tracking. In this paper, we present the results of sea tests where satellite imagery was combined with concurrent passive acoustic surveillance. The wide area sensing was provided by the University of Miami CSTARS facility's electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. Satellites detected the ships using a panchromatic EO sensor FormoSat-2 and SAR from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The Stevens Passive Acoustic System was used for detecting sound produced by the same ships that were detected by satellites. Concurrent Satellite - Acoustic measurements provide the following advantages: 1. Increasing the probability of small vessel detection and decreasing false alarms. 2. The joint systems can provide redundant detection and classification in conditions where one of the systems fails. For example, EO satellite imaging does not work at night and in fog and cloudy conditions while acoustic detection has limits during stormy weather due to ambient noise. SAR imaging can detect vessels in all weather, but provides less detail about a specific vessel. 3. Acoustics can provide target classification and bearing and satellites can give target localization and heading. SAR data can be used to estimate vessel speed in some cases. 4. Satellite imaging is helpful for the acoustic detection of an underwater target in cases when satellite information allows separation of surface and underwater targets. 5. Joint measurements provide more data (information) for target classification. Several tests were conducted in New York Harbor, where the satellite images and acoustic signatures of the same boats were recorded. The satellite registered a number of small boats. The small boats were acoustically detected at distances up to 4 km and the signal generated by a passenger ferry was observed at a distance up to 7 km.","Satellites,military radar,Stevens passive acoustic system,CSTARS facility's electro-optical radar,maritime domain awareness,acoustic signature,maritime security,underwater vehicles,DHS National Center of Excellence,acoustic detection,satellite tracking,Acoustic sensing,target tracking,Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce,Miami University,HF radar systems,synthetic aperture radar,satellite imaging,panchromatic EO sensor,underwater surveillance,port security,radar imaging,vessel detection,optical radar,underwater acoustic communication,New York Harbor,Acoustics,offshore operations,Boats,Sonar equipment,coastal operations,satellite sensing,passive acoustics,acoustic surveillance,Surveillance,FormoSat-2,COSMO-SkyMed constellation,Security,target classification,"
"situational awareness measurement in a simulation-based training framework for offshore well control operations","2019","Human factors are identified as the major contributor to oil and gas drilling and operations related accidents. One major limitation of the currently available simulation-based training programs is the lack of objective and validated measures for human factors and non-technical skills. These objective measures are necessary to evaluate the skills and training of drilling crews. Situational awareness (SA) describes the person's perception, comprehension, and prediction in dynamic environments. SA is critical in time-sensitive decision making, which may be especially pertinent for kick-detection and blowout mitigation. This paper presents the analyses of multiple objective SA measures in an immersive training environment. The SA for a sample of engineering-in-training students (n = 13) was measured using a well control incident simulator. The data analyses include knowledge tests, a voice log analysis, usability measures, check-lists compliance, pre/post performance surveys, and eye-tracking data. The results show that task knowledge (e.g. current pressure readings, current bit depth) was predictive of overall blowout mitigation performance. Further, the usability results provide some preliminary insights into task risk perceptions, task difficulty, and perceptions of communication. The results may help design an objective simulation-based training framework for human factors and non-technical skills measurement in oil and gas well control operations.","Simulation-based training,Well control,Situation awareness,"
"a wideband satellite maritime channel model simulator","2022","In this article, we present implementation details of a generative satellite maritime propagation channel model at L-band. In an earlier paper, we presented the parameterization of the channel model for the narrowband case based on recordings of GPS L1  $C/N_{0}$  time-series in different sea state conditions. Additionally, we performed wider band measurements using GPS E5a (â‰ˆ10 Mcpsâ€”chips per secondâ€” > 20 MHz bandwidth) and obtained estimations of power delay profiles. Due to lack of dynamic range and delay resolution, in these measurements, no conclusive information was gathered on the time spreading caused by the channel. What was clear is that the time spreading was not significant outside the first signal chip, i.e.,  $\approx 0.1~\mu \text{s}$ . Still wideband modeling is required within this spreading range. Now, we want to extend the model to the wideband case. To achieve this goal, we have used a rough surface scattering model applicable to sea surfaces and employed it to characterize the time dispersion to be expected. Additionally, we also used this scattering model to help verify the validity of the existing Doppler spread model. Furthermore, ship movements in the waves play a role. We try and analyze this issue.

"multivessel computation offloading in maritime mobile edge computing network","2019","With the development of the maritime networks, the data of vessel users is growing exponentially, and more and more resource intensive tasks, such as multimedia applications, high-definition video playback and games, appear in the daily demands. These changes have greatly increased the energy consumption and bandwidth requirements of vessel terminals and networks. In order to meet the requirements of high bandwidth and low delay for the high-speed development of mobile network, and reduce the network load, the concept of mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed and has been widely supported by the academia and industry. It is considered to be one of the key technologies of the next generation networks. Inspired by this idea, this paper introduces computing offloading technology to maritime mobile cloud networks. Maritime mobile cloud network is the product of the continuous development of cloud computing technology and mobile Internet technology. In this paper, we studied the issue of computation task offloading for vessel terminals, focusing on minimizing the energy consumption of vessel terminals and the execution delay of computation task. First, it determines that whether if it should be offloaded to the cloud server. Second, the server should be selected to run the computation task. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the energy consumption of vessel terminals and the execution delay of computation task taking into account of different weights.

Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"

However, the security dimensions of maritime VSAT services are not well understood. Historically, high equipment costs have acted as a barrier to entry for both researchers and attackers. In this paper we demonstrate a substantial change in threat model, proving practical attacks against maritime VSAT networks with less than $400 of widely-available television equipment. This is achieved through GSExtract, a purpose-built forensic tool which enables the extraction of IP traffic from highly corrupted VSAT data streams.The implications of this threat are assessed experimentally through the analysis of more than 1.3 TB of real-world maritime VSAT recordings encompassing 26 million square kilometers of coverage area. The underlying network platform employed in these systems is representative of more than 60% of the global maritime VSAT services market. We find that sensitive data belonging to some of the world's largest maritime companies is regularly leaked over VSAT ship-to-shore communications. This threat is contextualized through illustrative case studies ranging from the interception and alteration of navigational charts to theft of passport and credit card details. Beyond this, we demonstrate the ability to arbitrarily intercept and modify TCP sessions under certain network configurations, enabling man-in-the-middle and denial of service attacks against ships at sea.

"cubesat communication system for maritime needs","2020","This paper proposes a design of CubeSat communication system between ships and ground station for Automatic Identification System (AIS) using Software Defined Radio (SDR). The CubeSat operates as a relay point to increase the ground station's detection range. The communication system design is divided into three subsystems; AIS, data communication, and Telemetry, Tracking & Control (TT&C).

"paraphrasing techniques for maritime qa system","2022","There has been an increasing interest in incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Defence and military systems to complement and augment human intelligence and capabilities. However, much work still needs to be done toward achieving an effective human-machine partnership. This work is aimed at enhancing human-machine communications by developing a capability for automatically translating human natural language into a machine-understandable language (e.g., SQL queries). Techniques toward achieving this goal typically involve building a semantic parser trained on a very large amount of high-quality manually-annotated data. However, in many real-world Defense scenarios, it is not feasible to obtain such a large amount of training data. To the best of our knowledge, there are few works trying to explore the possibility of training a semantic parser with limited manually-paraphrased data, in other words, zero-shot.

"an overview of 5g slicing operational business models for internet of vehicles, maritime iot applications and connectivity solutions","2021","Identification of ecosystems and Business Models (BM) is an important starting point for new complex system development. The definition of actor (or stakeholder) roles and their interactions (at both business and technical levels), together with target scenarios and use cases, provide essential input information for further system requirement collection and architecture specification. The powerful and flexible Fifth Generation (5G) network slicing technology, which is capable of creating virtually isolated and logically parallel networks, enables a large range of complex services and vertical applications. Although various terminologies and models have been proposed in recent years for BMs in the 5G domain by many studies, projects, standards, and technical specifications from dedicated organizations, they are not always consistent with each other. This study presents an overview and comparison of different BMs for 5G sliced systems, followed by an example on BM definition for a 5G system in a novel ongoing European research project. While a general ecosystem and business model could involve a large range of organizations (including, e.g., regulation and standardization bodies), the scope of this article will be limited to primarily 5G operational BMs, with a focus on those actors or stakeholders who are active and interacting during real-life system operation. Within the project, we perform a selection among some tailored BM configurations, adapted for dedicated slices with different service requirements, aiming to serve Vehicle to Everything (V2X) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications as well as Internet of Things (IoT) for maritime vertical applications.

"non-satellite broadband maritime communications for e-navigation services","2021","The development of broadband network access technologies available to users on land has triggered a rapid expansion of a diverse range of services provided by terrestrial networks. However, due to limitations of digital communication technologies in the off-shore area, the maritime ICT systems evolution so far has not followed that trend. Despite the e-navigation initiative defining the set of Maritime Services, the progress in the maritime ICT systems evolution has been slow. Only a few systems, including the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES), or the TRI-Media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) have been proposed to extend the basic set of services offered by classical radio-communication solutions. However, all those systems have significant limitations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the netBaltic system designed as a fully heterogeneous system for modern maritime communications. Its unique feature is the capability to transparently use different communication technologies to efficiently support maritime ICT services, as well as openness for the incorporation of future communication technologies. The paper presents an overview of VDES, TRITON and netBaltic systems and analysis showing their expected strengths and weaknesses. The systems are then compared in simulated environments, illustrating real-world usage scenarios based on real maritime traffic information and performance measurements obtained during off-shore measurement campaigns. Results indicate that netBaltic seems to be the most versatile one and is capable of offering access to all services defined by International Maritime Organization, due to its ability to use different communication technologies simultaneously and functionality offered by its Delay Tolerant Networking component.","international maritime organization,Safety,wireless mesh networks,broadband network access technologies,wireless communication,Organizations,Communication systems,Wireless communication,VHF data exchange system,maritime ICT services,future communication technologies,maritime ICT systems evolution,different communication technologies,satellite communication,data communication,performance measurements,terrestrial networks,Broadband communication,digital communication technologies,TRI media telematic oceanographic network,modern maritime communications,netBaltic system,maritime services,maritime traffic information,telecommunication traffic,fully heterogeneous system,marine technology,classical radio communication solution,nonsatellite broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,computer networks,marine communication,e-navigation Services,network topology,mobile communication,Navigation,Task analysis,Information and communication technology,"
"protection of the mobile station from the interference by maritime earth station in motion in the 28 ghz band","2018","The Earth Stations in Motion (ESIM) system are one of the most modern satellite systems, providing high-speed and high-capacity communication with mobility. ESIM in the Ka-band should be operated under the condition ensuring the protection of existing services in the same frequency band. Therefore compatibility studies of ESIM with incumbent services in the same frequency band should be conducted before authorization, licence or operation of EISM. This paper provides a methodology to assess the interference from maritime ESIM to an MS stations in the 28 GHz frequency band. Taking into account a point-to-point interference scenario, the simulation results show the separation distances between maritime ESIM and MS station for protecting the MS stations. We considered the heights of station, elevation angle and time percentage in calculating the interference to reflect various factors affecting the interference level. The separation distance of up to 155 km would be required to ensure the protection of MS receiver taking the results of simulation into consideration.","Frequency sharing,ESIM,Satellite system,MS,FSS,"
"application scenarios of nautical ad-hoc network for maritime communications","2009","In terrestrial wireless communications, high data-rate transmission can be readily achieved by installing base stations on the ground. However, the same system may not be adapted to maritime communication due to the geographically restricted nature of the sea, and therefore, MF/HF modems, capable of long-distance transmission, with low data-rate are frequently employed in maritime communication. Maritime satellite communication through Inmarsat is conventionally used to compensate for the low data-rate transmission of MF/HF modems, but its high cost still remains as a main drawback. In order to enhance the transmission speed with a fairly low price, in general, a network whose architecture is similar to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), that allows peer-to-peer communications without base stations, i.e., ad-hoc network, is crucial. Herein, we propose an ad-hoc network for nautical environment, which is named as Nautical Ad-hoc Network (NANET). In this paper, scenarios toward NANET development are described and analysis of multiple access and duplexing schemes for corresponding NANET scenarios is discussed.

"power allocation for maritime cognitive satellite-uav-terrestrial networks","2020","In this paper, we investigate hybrid satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-terrestrial networks for maritime coverage enhancement. We adopt tethered UAVs to provide aerial base station (BS) sites, and orchestrate onshore and UAV-mounted BSs in a user-centric manner. To address the spectrum scarcity problem, all available spectrum is shared among satellites, UAVs and terrestrial base stations (TBSs). This generates undesirable challenging co-channel interference (CCI) under the irregular cell-free system topology. We establish a cognitive framework to sense not only the spectrum status but also ships' position information. According to the cognitive information, user-centric virtual clusters are self organized by a group of UAVs and onshore BSs. Besides, location-dependent large-scale channel state information (CSI) can be obtained through the cognitive position information. We thus optimize the power allocation strategy with only the large-scale CSI, to further mitigate both the inter-cluster interference and leakage interference to satellite users. The problem is non-convex. By using the random matrix theory and successive convex optimization methods, we solve it in an iterative way.

"maritime coverage enhancement using uavs coordinated with hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks","2020","Due to the agile maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great promise for on-demand communications. In practice, UAV-aided aerial base stations are not separate. Instead, they rely on existing satellites/terrestrial systems for spectrum sharing and efficient backhaul. In this case, how to coordinate satellites, UAVs and terrestrial systems is still an open issue. In this paper, we deploy UAVs for coverage enhancement of a hybrid satellite-terrestrial maritime communication network. Using a typical composite channel model including both large-scale and small-scale fading, the UAV trajectory and in-flight transmit power are jointly optimized, subject to constraints on UAV kinematics, tolerable interference, backhaul, and the total energy of the UAV for communications. Different from existing studies, only the location-dependent large-scale channel state information (CSI) is assumed available, because it is difficult to obtain the small-scale CSI before takeoff in practice and the ship positions can be obtained via the dedicated maritime Automatic Identification System.

Orientations of antennas on a ship are limited so that transmitted electromagnetic waves are not affected by structures on the ship.

"maritime communications and remote voyage monitoring","2020","For ships at sea, communicating with other ships or even to land-based sites has always been a very difficult task. Around 1900, the installation of wireless communication equipment on ships began. This form of communication initially used radio waves in the MF (Medium Frequency) band. Ever since it has been undergoing various technological innovations. At present, in addition to typical terrestrial communication in the VHF band, satellite communication using microwaves is also possible. Further, these forms of data communication have replaced the telegraph and telephone. Even now, however, the speed and capacity of data communication are significantly less than that of the land-based data communication network. After reviewing the situation of maritime communication, this paper studies the data communication for autonomous navigation of ships that is currently in demand focusing on remote monitoring. It appears that few instances of obtaining verification through detailed on-board data related to real-time communication have previously been possible. That being the case, the authors posit that it is worthwhile to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining relevant verification based on actual data via a university training vessel equipped with the latest data collection system - a system that is relatively unavailable even on new, large-scale merchant ships. Particularly for digital data, maritime communication remains mainly via relatively slow and expensive narrowband satellite transmission. Though speedier and more efficient data transfer is possible through the use of simple data compression, the costs for this mode are currently prohibitively high. It is posited that economical, speedy, and efficient data transfer via data compression will increasingly become economically available for more ships in the future.","Digital Ship,marine navigation,terrestrial communication,VHF band,latest data collection system,satellite communication,medium frequency band,data communication,ships,Remote Monitoring,Maritime Communication,economical data transfer,data compression,wireless communication equipment,history,Data Communication,marine communication,remote voyage monitoring,autonomous navigation,maritime communications,"
"mimo unmanned surface vessels enabled maritime wireless network coexisting with satellite network: beamforming and trajectory design","2023","Due to the flexible deployment, unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have attracted much interest recently. To solve the resource scarcity problem at sea, USV needs to leverage existing terrestrial and satellite systems for efficient backhaul and spectrum sharing. In this case, the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology can be applied for diversity gain improvement and interference coordination. However, how to adopt MIMO technology into maritime networks with a sparse scattering environment is still an open issue. In this paper, we employ a multi-antenna USV to support on-demand communications. Utilizing the two-ray channel, we aim to maximize the sum throughput over all USV intended users, by jointly optimizing the cooperative beamforming and trajectory, subject to several practical constraints, including the USV kinetics, quality of service requirement and backhaul capacity. Different from existing whole period designs, we decompose the problem into sequential one-slot problems. Within each slot, the non-convex problem is solved iteratively by using problem decomposition and successive convex optimization methods. Then, channel estimation errors are considered to investigate a robust beamforming scheme. Numerical simulations validate that the USV coexists well with the satellite network and show that the beamforming scheme and trajectory design complement each other for performance improvement.","Satellites,USV network,array signal processing,quality of service requirement,antenna arrays,successive convex optimization methods,USV kinetics,maritime wireless network,Maritime wireless network,satellite systems,convex programming,quality of service,Satellite antennas,radio spectrum management,concave programming,nonconvex problem,channel estimation errors,interference coordination,sequential one-slot problems,Wireless networks,flexible deployment,diversity gain improvement,Array signal processing,satellite communication,channel estimation,sparse scattering environment,resource scarcity problem,trajectory design,satellite network,robust beamforming scheme,beamforming,diversity reception,MIMO technology,efficient backhaul,Trajectory,cooperative communication,unmanned surface vehicles,MIMO unmanned surface vessels,marine communication,backhaul capacity,Interference,MIMO communication,spectrum sharing,maximization,"
"multi-reflector multi-band antennas for airborne and maritime broadband applications","2013","In all main offshore maritime activities (business, transport, yachting, etc.), the possibility to access wideband-Internet services via satellite is more and more interesting for both passenger and crew members. The same interest is increasing also for communication onboard airplanes. For some particular applications, high data rate exchange of operational information with the staff on the ground is required while, for commercial applications, satellite communications provide passengers with infotainment services (IPTV reception) as well as with broadband connectivity. The launch of new satellites generation, working in Ka-band with regional or global earth coverage, allows high throughput capacity, with an increase of the available bandwidth and a decrease of satellite connectivity costs. This reflects in a new interest for high performance mobile Ka Band antenna terminals and even more for the Ku/Ka bands reconfigurable ones. Starting from a consolidated company experience, after developing high speed trains Ku/Ka bands Satcom products, a new fully mechanical antenna design, able to work both in Ku and Ka-band, is outlined here below. The main technical aspects of a multi-reflector antenna, working in Ku and Ka frequency bands, will be analyzed even considering the different design guidelines for two selected field of applications.

"satellite cns for maritime transportation augmentation system (mtas)","2009","The development of the MTAS was to identify the possible applications for enhancement of digital selective call (DCS) MF/HF/VHF radio; satellite communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS); GPS and GLONASS; and safety systems including security and control of vessels, logistic and freight at sea, on inland waters and the security of crew and passengers on board ships, cruisers, boats and hovercrafts. These enhancements include many applications for the better management and operation of vessels and they are needed more than ever because of world merchant fleet expansion. Just the top 20 world ships registers have about 40,000 units under their national flags. Above all, the biggest problem today is that merchant ships and their crews are targets of the types of crime traditionally associated with the maritime industries, such as piracy, robbery and recently, a target for terrorist attacks. Thus, IMO and flag states will have a vital role in developing International Ship and Port Security (ISPS). The best way to implement ISPS is to design an Approaching and Port Control System (APCS) by special code augmentation satellite CNS including tracking and monitoring of all vehicle circulation in and out of the port area. The establishment of MTAS as a part of Global Satellite Augmentation Systems (GSAS) or GNSS-1, such as the US WAAS, European EGNOS, Japanese MSAS, Chinese SNAS, Indian GAGAN and future GSAS including African Satellite Augmentation System (ASAS) will meet all these requirements and will complement the services already provided by DGPS or Local VHF Augmentation System (LVAS) and MF radio beacons.","satellite CNS,MTAS,APCS,port area,Satellite navigation systems,Transportation,hovercrafts,US WAAS,Communication system security,GLONASS,GSAS,ISPS,Marine vehicles,Global Positioning System,European EGNOS,navigation and surveillance,Radio navigation,African satellite augmentation system,Satellite communication,crew security,marine safety,satellite navigation,cruisers,maritime transportation augmentation system,International Ship and Port Security,boats,Distributed control,Chinese SNAS,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,GNSS-1,safety systems,world merchant fleet expansion,Indian GAGAN,satellite communications,mobile satellite communication,Global Satellite Augmentation Systems,marine communication,Approaching and Port Control System,Control systems,board ships,terrorist attacks,special code augmentation satellite CNS,marine vehicles,Japanese MSAS,local VHF augmentation system,MF radio beacons,digital selective call,"
"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"
"a novel non-stationary 6g uav channel model for maritime communications","2021","To achieve space-air-ground-sea integrated communication networks for future sixth generation (6G) communications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications applying to maritime scenarios serving as mobile base stations have recently attracted more attentions. The UAV-to-ship channel modeling is the fundamental for the system design, testing, and performance evaluation of UAV communication systems in maritime scenarios. In this paper, a novel non-stationary multi-mobility UAV-to-ship channel model is proposed, consisting of three kinds of components, i.e., the line-of-sight (LoS) component, the single-bounce (SB) components resulting from the fluctuation of sea water, and multi-bounce (MB) components introduced by the waveguide effect over the sea surface. In the proposed model, the UAV as the transmitter (Tx), the ship as the receiver (Rx), and the clusters between the Tx and Rx, can be seen as moving with arbitrary velocities and arbitrary directions. Then, some typical statistical properties of the proposed UAV-to-ship channel model, including the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF), spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), delay PSD, angular PSD, stationary interval, and root mean square (RMS) delay spread, are derived and investigated.

"integrated flexible maritime crane architecture for the offshore simulation centre as (osc): a flexible framework for alternative maritime crane control algorithms","2016","The Offshore Simulator Centre AS (OSC) is the world's most advanced provider of simulators for demanding offshore operations. However, even though the OSC provides very powerful simulation tools, it is mainly designed for training purposes and it does not inherently offer any flexible methods concerning the control methodology. In fact, each crane model is controlled with a dedicated control algorithm that cannot be modified, accessed, or replaced at runtime. As a result, it is not possible to dynamically switch between different control methods, nor is it possible to easily investigate alternative control approaches. To overcome these problems, a flexible and general control system architecture that allows for modeling flexible control algorithms of maritime cranes and more generally, robotic arms, was previously presented by our research group. However, in the previous work, a generic game engine was used to visualize the different models. In this work, the flexible and general control system architecture is integrated with a crane simulator developed by the OSC taking full advantage of the provided domain-consistent simulation tools. The Google Protocol Buffers protocol is adopted to realize the communication protocol. This integration establishes the base for the research of alternative control algorithms, which can be efficiently tested in a realistic maritime simulation environment.

"a general orthogonal transform aided mimo design for reliable maritime visible light communications","2020","In maritime visible light communication (VLC) systems, user information is delivered among different terminals distributed in the atmosphere, and the underwater environment. To combat the complex and variant marine channel conditions induced by the absorption, scattering, and turbulence influence, in this article, we propose a general orthogonal transform (OT) aided multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission scheme to enhance the transmission reliability performances. In our design, we propose to construct the orthogonal transform matrix recursively with the Hadamard matrix. Thus we could exploit the repetitive property of the elements in the orthogonal matrix to enlarge the Euclidean distances among the signals. Moreover, the value of the elements could be adjusted dynamically to adapt to time-changing channel conditions. Thanks to the orthogonality of the matrix, and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the interferences among signals could be effectively suppressed. Accordingly, the reliability performances can be improved. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical symbol error rate (SER) expressions for the proposed design. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the SER performances with different water types, and wind speeds in various scenarios of the atmosphere, underwater, and air-water interface channels are investigated, and compared with the counterpart systems.","telecommunication network reliability,multiple input multiple output transmission scheme,underwater environment,Reliability engineering,user information,transmission reliability performances,Visible light communication,maritime visible light communication systems,matrix algebra,singular value decomposition,variant marine channel conditions,reliability,multiple input multiple output,Matrix decomposition,turbulence influence,free-space optical communication,Scattering,orthogonal transform aided MIMO design,Reliability theory,error statistics,Euclidean distances,orthogonal transform matrix,maritime visible light communication,wireless channels,symbol error rate expressions,reliable maritime visible light communications,SER performances,Hadamard matrix,marine communication,complex marine channel conditions,orthogonal transform,Air and underwater channels,MIMO communication,Transforms,air-water interface channels,"
"a single-carrier delay-and-superposition based high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying for maritime internet of vessels","2022","The fast growing Internet of Vessels (IoV) requires maritime communications to be more spectral efficient to make full use of the scarce maritime spectral resource, provide a high data transmission rate and support massive communication nodes to access the network. However, the spectral efficiency of most existing maritime communications are still relatively low, and consequently maritime communications can hardly support high volume multi-user communications. Therefore, in this paper, a high spectral efficiency Differential Chaos Shift Keying system based on a single-carrier delay-and-superposition modulation technology (SCDS-DCSK) is proposed for IoV scenarios. In a SCDS-DCSK symbol, all sub-carriers have the same frequency, indicating that the symbol of SCDS-DCSK only occupies the bandwidth of a single sub-channel. As a result, a large amount of maritime communication resources can be saved for accommodating more communication nodes and the spectral efficiency is significantly improved. System architectures and principles are firstly demonstrated. Then, the spectral efficiency, peak mean power ratio (PAPR), complexity, and the origin of error bits of SCDS-DCSK are analyzed, and the bit-error-rate expressions are derived. Moreover, effects of various system parameters and levels of sea states on the system performance are simulated and discussed. Simulation results verify the theoretical analyses, and manifest that the SCDS-DCSK can achieve a high spectral efficiency under various sea states. Thanks to characteristics such as high spectral efficiency, flexible parameter configuration, and simple implementation, SCDS-DCSK is a promising technology for improving the quality of service (QoS) of future maritime IoV.","single-carrier delay-and-superposition,peak mean power ratio,QoS,quality of service,SCDS-DCSK symbol,PAPR,modulation,future maritime IoV,Vessels,chaos,maritime communication resources,error statistics,Maritime communications,spectral efficiency,single subchannel,single carrier delay,Modulation,superposition modulation technology,Sea state,fast growing Internet,support massive communication nodes,chaotic communication,consequently maritime communications,Frequency modulation,high data transmission rate,Symbols,high volume multiuser communications,Chaotic communication,marine communication,maritime Internet of Vessels,Spectral efficiency,Internet of Vessels (IoV),Internet,scarce maritime spectral resource,high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying system,maritime communications,"
"reer-h: a reliable energy efficient routing protocol for maritime intelligent transportation systems","2023","The Underwater sensor network (UWSN), also known as Marine Sensor Network (MSN), is gaining increasing attention due to its applications in the monitoring of the marine environment and assisting Marine Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITS). Such systems provide in-vehicle assistance services (i.e., traffic monitoring and driver alerts) by gathering transportation and environmental information. Though very promising, there are several barriers to developing energy-efficient communication protocols for heterogeneous MSN, including selecting optimal routing paths twinned with the lifetime of these sensor nodes along the path, which are restricted due to the limited energy storage capacity. Hereby, the selection of an optimal route path also necessitates harvesting and management of the sensor nodesâ€™ energy. To facilitate this, the current work presents REER-H, a Reliable Energy Efficient Routing protocol with Harvesting for cluster-based MSN capable of multi-source energy harvesting and an incorporated energy management technique. Incorporating three separate layers of the protocol stack, namely, network, MAC, and physical layers, REER-H uses its proposed adaptive scheduling technique to support collision-free data transmission by assigning adaptive time slots based on demand and data load. Also, the proposed integrated energy harvesting and management solves the energy hole problem and enhances the overall network lifetime. In comparison to the existing cooperative and cluster-based energy-efficient routing protocols for underwater maritime communication, the simulated results using Network Simulator-3 (NS3) reveal that the proposed scheme remarkably enhances the overall network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, lifetime energy consumption, and end-to-end delay for MSN.","Reliability,optimal routing,underwater communication,Routing,Energy efficiency,Routing protocols,Energy harvesting,energy harvesting,Monitoring,Energy management,Relays,energy efficiency,"

The proximity-based IoT service is a type of service that becomes available once an IoT object comes near other objects. This type of service typically involves proximity machine-type communication (MTC) that allows direct communication between objects in a spatiotemporal context on an ad-hoc basis. The IoT world has witnessed increasing cases of such applications in recent years, but proximity MTC has not received sufficient attention in the IoT community. As such, this paper presents the unique characteristics and requirements of proximity MTC, focusing on differentiating proximity MTC from infrastructure-based wide-area MTC and service-centric networking from host-centric networking. Specifically, the paper utilizes an emerging application in maritime IoT, maritime autonomous surface shipping (MASS), as an example and offers an insightful and rigorous examination of the legacy maritime communications technology, pointing out the pitfalls to avoid in the development and standardization of proximity MTC in light of the recent spectrum assignment by ITU.

Based on that, the resource allocation is jointly optimized for all users over all time slots during the voyage, which is a mixed 0-1 non-convex programming problem. We transform this problem into a convex one by means of variable substitution and time-sharing relaxation, and propose an iterative algorithm to solve it based on the Lagrangian dual decomposition method.

"uav-aided anti-jamming maritime communications: a deep reinforcement learning approach","2021","Maritime communication suffers from reactive jammer that keeps silent when the channel is idle and launches jamming signals as soon as sensing the activity on the channel to disrupt the maritime communication and even cause the maritime tracking and monitoring task failure. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based maritime anti-jamming communication scheme that applies the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the relay to forward the message between ships. This scheme enables both the transmitting ship and the UAV to select the power control policy without relying on the jamming model and the message generation model. Instead, the policies are chosen based on the current state consisting of the distances, the received signal strength indication, the received jamming power and the bit error rate (BER). We design two dueling neutral networks respectively to select the power control policy and update the network weights to reduce the overestimation. The dueling architecture consists of two streams that estimate the value of the current state and the state-dependent advantage function of the power control policy to accelerate the learning speed. A UAV-aided anti-jamming maritime communication game is formulated and the performance bound including the BER of marine messages and the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV is derived based on the Stackelberg equilibrium.

"effect of smart meter data collection frequency in an early detection of shorter-duration voltage anomalies in smart grids","2019","Smart grids are required to respond quickly and efficiently to any types of electrical incidents. This is possible only if advanced monitoring and decision support tools are available for the operators to collect and analyze the real-time data from the entire power system. Sensors and smart meters become necessary for an effective smart grid operation, as they can play a significant role in measuring system parameters such as the temperature of the transmission line, power outages and power usage. These sensors allow communication between the generation side and user side to ensure full network observability. Hence, the volume of data which needs to be analyzed for more reliable electrical services has been increased. Upon the analysis of all the data collected, useful insights can be gained to bring benefits to the utilities, consumers and the related organizations. In this project, the effect of smart meter data collection frequencies on the early detection of short-duration voltage anomalies has been investigated. An anomaly detection algorithm that analyzes the voltages collected from smart meters is developed. The proposed anomaly detector checks the normality of the voltage data collected from the smart meters installed at the residential loads. To test the effectiveness of the frequent-and-large smart meter data, a smart grid model was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the model was tested under three different operating conditions. The efficacy of the anomaly detector with the smart meter data collected at different data collection intervals was compared under the three operating conditions. The investigation of the smart meter data clearly shows that the shorter-duration anomalies can be detected effectively with more frequent data and hence it reveals the potential of smart meters in the early detection of short-duration anomalies in smart grids.","Smart devices,Anomaly detection system,Photovoltaic system,Large data,Smart grid,"

"the lsts software toolchain for persistent maritime operations applied through vehicular ad-hoc networks","2017","In order to further expand the sustainability of maritime operations the use of autonomous vehicles has been employed at an increasing scale. This natural increase comes not only in the form of the multiplication of the numbers of the same vehicle model, but also in diversifying the vehicle composition setup in order to allow the exploitation of different types of payloads. Moreover, this use of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams allows overcoming individual limitations that one specific vehicle model might have. Nevertheless, this increase in scale and functionality also causes an increase in control, management, and spatial and operational complexity. This complexity is addressed in the framework of the LSTS Neptus-IMC-Dune software toolchain. The software toolchain is a framework for mixed-initiative control (humans in the planning and control loops) of unmanned ocean and air vehicles operating in communications challenged environments with support for Disruptive Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. The use of such a toolchain has allowed for repeated and successful deployments of heterogeneous multi-vehicle teams.

"satellite machine-type communication for maritime internet of things: an interference perspective","2019","Satellite machine-type communication plays a crucial role in the maritime Internet of Things. The realization of such a system, i.e., the VHF data exchange (VDES) satellite system, however, faces many technical challenges. Due to its global broadcasting nature, the interference generated from the emissions of the VDES satellite space stations to the incumbent or future land systems in the same band is of major concern to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) spectrum allocation. However, neither regulatory rules nor related studies have been specified or made available in the literature regarding such interference. This paper utilizes the electromagnetic power flux density (PFD) mask concept for evaluating and constraining the emission onto earth from a satellite space station. The mathematical analysis and derivation are based on the principle that the actual interference from a space station that a land system experiences is no worse than that from any other land system allowed by the regulations. We demonstrate the derivation of such a PFD mask from three closely related regulations on the legacy land mobile systems by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) and ITU and present the corresponding constraints imposed on the VDES satellite system and their impacts on the performance of the system.","VDES satellite space station system,interference perspective,satellite machine-type communication,maritime machine-type communication,VHF data exchange satellite system,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,satellite communication,electromagnetic PFD mask concept,Space stations,ITU,Electronic Communications Committee,e-navigation,electronic data interchange,Maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,space communication links,maritime Internet of Things,radiofrequency interference,ITU spectrum allocation,electromagnetic power flux density mask concept,Satellite broadcasting,ECC,mathematical analysis,land system experiences,land mobile systems,Interference,International Telecommunication Union spectrum allocation,"
"coordinated maritime missions of unmanned vehicles â€” network architecture and performance analysis","2017","Multi-vehicle operations using various types of unmanned vehicles (UVs) can increase efficiency of marine data acquisition, reduce the crew risk and lower mission costs.

Typically, a common network system architecture and Situation Awareness (SA) platform are required. The architecture allows operators to transfer data between vehicles and their operators, while the SA platform allows to monitor mission progress and react to changes.

"hierarchical maritime radio networks for internet of maritime things","2019","Despite the potential benefits of a maritime Internet of Things, a number of issues hinder its realization, including the need for wide area coverage and cost-effectiveness. Toward these needs, a model is first presented for uplink maritime radio communications that hierarchically employ Wi-Fi and cellular links for data transmission from marine user equipments (MUEs) on a ship to a cellular base station with distributed antennas (DAs) along a coastline. Then, the performances are evaluated given in terms of average data rate and outage probability in the hierarchical maritime radio networks. When evaluating the performances, heterogeneous channel characteristics of the hierarchical networks are taken into account in which Rayleigh fading is considered for the MUE-ship links, whereas shadowed-Rician fading is considered for the ship-DA links. Moreover, the effects due to various transmission errors that can be occurred at different communication layers are reflected in determining the quality of service (QoS) requirements of a ship. With the help of authors' analysis, an antenna selection algorithm is proposed under which the minimum size of a service cloud can be found to support the QoS requirements of MUEs with a ship.

"innovative maritime communications technologies","2010","Current maritime systems are to a large extent based on legacy analog VHF radios for ship-to-shore communications near port waters, and relatively low bandwidth digital satellite communications (SatCom) for long-range ship-to-ship/shore communications. The cost of bandwidth for SatCom networks is expected to remain high due to the cost of launching satellites into orbit and also due to the stabilizers required for presently available on-board antennas. On the other hand, the legacy VHF system comprises low bandwidth radios incapable of supporting applications requiring high data rates.

The systems that facilitate maritime shipping are at risk of serious disruptions, and these disruptions can stem from vulnerabilities in the software and processes used in these systems. These vulnerabilities leave such systems open to cyber-attack. Assessments of the security of maritime shipping systems have focused on identifying risks but have not taken the critical (and expensive) next step of actually identifying vulnerabilities present in these systems. While such risk assessments are important, they have not provided the detailed identification of security issues in the systems that control these ports and their terminals.

We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power of the BS and active relay ships, by jointly optimizing the relay mode selection vector, transmit power, as well as active and passive beamforming, subject to the quality of service of the destination ship. The joint optimization problem is solved by alternatively solving two sub-problems, i.e., the joint mode selection and power control sub-problem, and the joint active and passive beamforming sub-problem. Two algorithms based on exhaustive searching and many-to-one matching are respectively proposed for solving the first sub-problem, while a semidefinite programming-based algorithm is proposed for solving the second sub-problem.

"modulation recognition in maritime multipath channels: a blind equalization-aided deep learning approach","2020","Modulation recognition has been long investigated in the literature, however, the performance could be severely degraded in multipath fading channels especially for high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals. This could be a critical problem in the broadband maritime wireless communications, where various propagation paths with large differences in the time of arrival are very likely to exist. Specifically, multiple paths may stem from the direct path, the reflection paths from the rough sea surface, and the refraction paths from the atmospheric duct, respectively. To address this issue, we propose a novel blind equalization-aided deep learning (DL) approach to recognize QAM signals in the presence of multipath propagation. The proposed approach consists of two modules: A blind equalization module and a subsequent DL network which employs the structure of ResNet. With predefined searching step-sizes for the blind equalization algorithm, which are designed according to the set of modulation formats of interest, the DL network is trained and tested over various multipath channel parameter settings. It is shown that as compared to the conventional DL approaches without equalization, the proposed method can achieve an improvement in the recognition accuracy up to 30% in severe multipath scenarios, especially in the high SNR regime. Moreover, it efficiently reduces the number of training data that is required.","novel blind equalization-aided deep learning approach,direct path,refraction paths,Blind equalizers,blind equalization,telecommunication computing,QAM signals,Machine learning,blind equalization algorithm,Feature extraction,Quadrature amplitude modulation,blind equalisers,maritime multipath channels,propagation paths,modulation recognition,time of arrival,deep learning,rough sea surface,quadrature amplitude modulation,multipath propagation,Multipath channels,high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation signals,multipath channels,recognition accuracy,multipath fading channels,severe multipath scenarios,blind equalization module,reflection paths,Modulation recognition,multipath channel parameter settings,multiple paths,marine communication,conventional DL approaches,broadband maritime,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),fading channels,"
"unsupervised learning based coordinated multi-task allocation for unmanned surface vehicles","2021","In recent decades, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are attracting increasing attention due to their underlying capability in autonomously undertaking complex maritime tasks in constrained environments. However, the autonomy level of USVs is still limited, especially when being deployed to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously. This paper, therefore, aims to improve USVs autonomy level by investigating and developing an effective and efficient task management algorithm for multi-USV systems. To better deal with challenging requirements such as allocating vast tasks in cluttered environments, the task management has been de-composed into two submissions, i.e., task allocation and task execution. More specifically, unsupervised learning strategies have been used with an improved K-means algorithm proposed to first assign different tasks for a multi-USV system then a self-organising map (SOM) been implemented to deal with the task execution problem based upon the assigned tasks for each USV. Differing to other work, the communication problem that is crucial for USVs in a constrained environment has been specifically resolved by designing a new competition strategy for K-means algorithm. Key factors that will influence the communication capability in practical applications have been taken into account. A holistic task management architecture has been designed by integrating both the task allocation and task execution algorithms, and a number of simulations in both simulated and practical maritime environments have been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","Unsupervised learning,Multi-task allocation,Self-organising map (SOM),K-means clustering,Unmanned surface vehicle (USV),"

In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art works related to the data requirements of maritime services and the technical characteristics of existing maritime networks.

"path loss model of the maritime wireless communication in the seas of indonesia","2020","Maritime wireless communication establishment in the seas of Indonesia has already been under investigation. It is useful for supporting some activities in the sea, such as monitoring and surveillance, fishery, and exploration. Propagation characteristics in maritime environment is different from one in the land therefore needed to be studied more. One important aspect in maritime radio propagation is path loss caused by sea movement. Sea movement in the seas of Indonesia varies from smooth to rough according to Douglas sea scale. The rougher the sea movement, the severer the path loss that happens in radio propagation. In this paper, the effect of path loss to the performance of wireless communication in maritime environment is investigated. Simulations based on some scenarios of propagation are also performed and analyzed.","Antennas,Telecommunications,three ray,maritime radio propagation,seas of Indonesia,Marine vehicles,path loss,Communication systems,Wireless communication,maritime wireless communication,Radio transmitters,sea movement,Indonesia,radiowave propagation,Douglas sea scale,maritime wireless communication establishment,maritime environment,marine communication,Receivers,path loss model,"
"measurements and analysis of maritime wireless channel at 8 ghz in the south china sea region","2023","This article presents the measurement results of maritime wireless propagation channel at 8 GHz in the South China Sea (SCS) region. Large-scale path loss (PL) and small-scale fading of channels between a marine observation platform and a moving vessel are investigated. For large-scale PL, comparisons are conducted among the free space model, the two-ray model, the parabolic equation model (PEM), and the log-distance model with the measured PL data. The results show that the log-distance model agrees well with the general trend of the measured data, whereas the PEM has a better ability to capture the variations of the interference nulls. In addition, the free space model and the two-ray model have larger deviation from the empirical data, implying that they are not suitable for the desired scenario. For small-scale fading, various distributions are considered to fit the fading. Based on the criteria of Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov statistics, the Rician distribution has the best goodness of fit, compared with the Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Welbull, or lognormal distributions. These research can provide good guidance for efficient designing and future deployments of distributed buoy networks (DBNs) in the SCS region.","South China Sea region,Channel models,Rayleigh channels,path loss (PL),Mathematical models,DBN,large scale PL,Ducts,Antenna measurements,Nakagami channels,maritime wireless channel,Sea measurements,Wireless communication,two ray model,large scale path loss,maritime wireless propagation channel,distributed buoy networks,PEM,frequency 8.0 GHz,statistical analysis,microwave propagation,Rician channels,lognormal distributions,two-ray model,Data models,Rician distribution,free space model,log distance model,radiofrequency interference,wireless channels,measured PL data,marine observation platform,parabolic equations,Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics,small-scale fading,interference nulls,Loss measurement,marine communication,parabolic equation model,SCS region,empirical data,fading channels,"

The performed literary analysis of scientific sources of information confirms the significant lack of research aimed at the development of waterway infrastructure for unmanned ships. The study described in this paper is aimed at developing a design criterion that determines the possibility of using the waterway for the operation of autonomous ships. Data on the movement and density of ships for the waters of the Gulf of Finland according to the data of Automatic Identification System are presented. The analysis of vessel density in this work was carried out using the DBSCAN mathematical algorithm. It is proposed to use the concept and term 'knowledgeable' to include sections of the waterway in the zone of autonomous navigation. The involved experts assessed five criteria in terms of their significance: the availability of data on navigation on the selected section of the waterway, the availability of electronic navigation charts, the availability of hydrometeorological information, the availability of technical means of communication and navigational fencing. As a continuation of the research, it is proposed to study many qualitative and quantitative characteristics of both the area of the water area and the specialized equipment installed on it, since the operation of autonomous ships requires a more complex technical and information infrastructure.","knowledge of the water area,vessel traffic monitoring,DBSCAN,Autonomous navigation,maritime waterways,ships position clustering,automatic identification system,water transport system,expert system,"

"maritime moving target long time integration for gnss-based passive bistatic radar","2018","This paper addresses the exploitation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive bistatic radar systems for maritime surveillance. The main limitation of this technology is the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites, which makes it necessary to define innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration. To this aim, this paper puts forward long integration time techniques able to collect the signal energy over long time intervals (tens of seconds), allowing the retrieval of suitable levels of signal-to-disturbance ratios for detection purposes. A local plane based technique is first considered, providing target detection in a plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. As a suboptimum solution in terms of achievable integration gain, but more efficient from a computational point of view, a second technique is considered working in the conventional bistatic range and Doppler plane (basic plane based).

"a survey on uav-aided maritime communications: deployment considerations, applications, and future challenges","2023","Maritime activities represent a major domain of economic growth with several emerging maritime Internet of Things use cases, such as smart ports, autonomous navigation, and ocean monitoring systems. The major enabler for this exciting ecosystem is the provision of broadband, low-delay, and reliable wireless coverage to the ever-increasing number of vessels, buoys, platforms, sensors, and actuators. Towards this end, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in maritime communications introduces an aerial dimension to wireless connectivity going above and beyond current deployments, which are mainly relying on shore-based base stations with limited coverage and satellite links with high latency. Considering the potential of UAV-aided wireless communications, this survey presents the state-of-the-art in UAV-aided maritime communications, which, in general, are based on both conventional optimization and machine-learning-aided approaches. More specifically, relevant UAV-based network architectures are discussed together with the role of their building blocks.

"intelligent maritime communications enabled by deep reinforcement learning","2019","Nowadays, with maritime services grows exponentially, quality of service (QoS) for data transmission has become a bottleneck that restricts the development of maritime communication. In order to solve this problem, firstly, a software-defined maritime communication framework is proposed to overcome the difficulty of communication mode in heterogeneous environment. In addition, we propose a novel data transmission scheme with the enhanced deep Q-learning algorithm in this framework, which combines depth Q-network with softmax multiple classifier, also known as S-DQN algorithm. This scheme also mentions what the purpose of the optimization is (i.e., throughput, cost, energy). In our system, markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to implement the optimal strategy for network resource scheduling. The system employs the deep Q-network to establish the mapping relationship between the acquired information and the optimal strategy, and when the input data arrives, the optimal strategy can be as fast and accurate as possible due to a large amount of data self-learning.

"anti-jitter beamforming design for uav-assisted maritime monitoring networks","2023","With the wide application of Internet of Things systems in the smart ocean, many unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been deployed jointly with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor the maritime environment. However, conventional means of maritime communication prevent the UAV and the USV from providing high-rate services owing to complex maritime channel conditions and limited bandwidth, which will affect the maritime environment monitoring performance. In this paper, we propose a USV-UAV collaborative patrol scheme for maritime environment monitoring networks. Considering the characteristic of energy concentration in beamforming and the beam deviation caused by UAV jitter due to the harsh ocean condition, we studied an adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem in UAV-assisted maritime environment monitoring networks. Specifically, we decompose the adaptive anti-jitter beamforming problem into two subproblems. In the first sub-problem, the location deployment of UAV and beam gain allocation is optimized via an iterative search algorithm based on ideal beamforming. In the second sub-problem, anti-jitter beamforming design is solved by an adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm based on social learning, which effectively improves the average spectral efficiency of the system.

"characteristics of sea reflection fading in maritime satellite communications","1985","The Japanese domestic experimental mobile satellite system (EMSS) has been studied to establish high quality channels for small vessels with compact and low-gain antennas. The present international maritime satellite communication system (INMARSAT) has also been studied for the next generation to extend services for small ships, for which the present ship terminals including the antenna systems are too large and too heavy. By using a low-gain antenna, however, multipath fading caused by sea reflections will become a serious problem in designing the new system. To take effective countermeasures to the fading effect, it is very important to get a better knowledge of the fading phenomena caused by sea reflections. From a standpoint of maritime satellite communications, experiments measuring the amount of fading were performed under various sea conditions and in two frequency bands. The wave height, which is considered the most important experimental parameter, was measured objectively by a wave rider buoy.

"a generic approach to analysing failures in human – system interaction in autonomy","2020","Autonomous systems operation will in the foreseeable future rely on the interaction between software, hardware and humans. Efficient interaction and communication between these agents are crucial for safe operation. Conventional methods for hazard identification and safety assessment focus often on one of the aspects of the system only, e.g., human reliability, software failures, or equipment reliability. The method Human-System Interaction in Autonomy (H-SIA) was recently proposed, focusing on autonomous ships operation and collision scenarios. H-SIA provides a framework for analyzing autonomous ship operation as an entirety, rather than each agent separately. The method comprised initially of two main elements: An Event Sequence Diagram (ESD) and a Concurrent Task Analysis (CoTA). While the ESD models the events that can take place following an initiating event, the CoTA models which tasks the agents must perform for these events to succeed. This paper extends H-SIA to include the paths to failure, through the development of Fault Trees (FTs), which is necessary for risk analysis and identification of risk reduction measures. The FTs development of H-SIA introduces novelties in comparison to common FTs: (i) they model the system as whole, (ii) they are generic and can accommodate a diversity of systems designs; (iii) they lead to basic failure events. The FTs allows for identification of failure events arising through interaction between autonomous ship and human operators, as well as failure propagation through these agents. The basic failure events are applicable for different autonomous concepts. A case study on autonomous ship collision demonstrates the use of the extended method. The case study illustrates H-SIA’s applicability to different designs and levels of autonomy, its potential for identification of failure events, and its use in risk assessments.","System design,Human-autonomy interaction,Risk assessment,Autonomous systems,Autonomous ship,"
"multi-attribute selection of maritime heterogenous networks based on sdn and fog computing architecture","2018","Maritime intelligent transportation system provides intelligent, safe and efficient maritime transport services, which greatly facilitates the applications related to monitoring, safety, infotainment and cargo online management. The Internet of Things (IoT) is especially suitable for the networked communication environment at sea, and drives the development of maritime intelligent transportation on the trend. However, the existing data processing and forwarding methods pose great challenges to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In particular, realtime multi-type of data adopts different access technologies in wireless communication systems or use the same wireless access technology but belong to different wireless carriers. Utilizing the existing multi-type wireless communication systems, the architecture of the heterogeneous network through inter-system convergence makes multi-system complement to meet the demand of mobile communication services, so as to comprehensively play their respective advantages. In this paper, we consider a multiattribute decision-making method based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Rough Set based on the architecture of maritime wideband communication system with software defined network (SDN) and fog computing architecture.

Accordingly the performance of users far away from the BS is poor in general. This renders the fairness among users a challenging issue for maritime communications. In this paper, we consider a practical massive MIMO maritime BS with hybrid digital and analog precoding. Only the large-scale channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is considered so as to reduce the implementation complexity and overhead of the system. On this basis, we address the problem of fairness-oriented pre-coding design. A max-min optimization problem is formulated and solved in an iterative way.

Both involve various types of uncertainty and require a sound automated inferential process. Probabilistic ontologies support uncertainty management in se-mantically aware systems, and facilitate modular, interoperable systems. This paper describes the process of developing a probabilistic ontology for a Maritime Domain Awareness application. The ontology was created to support identification of ships behaving suspiciously enough to be declared ships of interest. The original model was expanded in two ways: to provide reasons for declaring a ship as being of interest, and to include individual crew member associations. The latter is achieved by supporting inferences about a person's close relations, group associations, communications, and background influences to assess his likelihood of having terrorist links.","predictive situational awareness,sensor fusion,sound automated inferential process,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,Bayesian networks,terrorist links,Organizations,MEBN,information fusion,uncertainty management,semantically aware systems,Electronic countermeasures,group associations,modeling methodology,uncertainty reasoning,ships,person close relations,Probabilistic logic,ontologies (artificial intelligence),situational awareness,PR-OWL,interoperable systems,uncertainty handling,essential element prediction,probabilistic ontology,Ontologies,facilitate modular,web services,Uncertainty,Terrorism,"
"game theoretical incentive for usv fleet-assisted data sharing in maritime communication networks","2023","With the rapid proliferations of maritime applications, the data demands of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) keep ever-increasing. However, due to limitations of resources (e.g., energy, storage, bandwidth, etc.) and high costs on data sharing, USVs do not provide data proactively, which hinders the efficiency of data sharing. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a game based USV fleet-assisted data sharing scheme to enable data exchange among USVs. Specially, we firstly propose a data publish/subscribe framework, where USVs are categorized into publishers and subscribers, and a USV fleet is motivated as a broker to relay data from publishers to subscribers. Then, the optimal waypoints for data publishing are recommended to the USV fleet to improve its probability of acquiring data. Furthermore, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) reverse auction game is utilized for data publishing, which ensures that the data publishers bid for USV fleets with own truthful costs, so as to avoid false bidding of data publishers. A double auction game is then employed for data subscription, which balances the benefits between the USV fleet and the data subscriber. An incentive-based data sharing algorithm is finally designed to obtain the optimal bidding strategies for all game parties including data publishers, USV fleets and data subscribers. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently increases the utilities of all participants, as compared to conventional schemes.","Oceans,Data models,auction game,data publish/subscribe,USV fleet,Costs,Games,Maritime communications,Relays,Maritime communication networks,Publishing,"
"comparative analysis of positioning capability of beidou and gps in maritime islands","2022","After the full deployment of the Beidou-3 global satellite navigation system constellation, the positioning service range has been expanded from the Asia-Pacific region to the whole world. At present, most of the research on the positioning capability of Beidou system is on the mainland, and there is still room for research on the positioning capability of islands at sea. In this paper, the data of four IGS tracking stations distributed in islands are selected and solved by Anubis software. The visualization of Beidou and GPS is analyzed in five aspects: satellite visible number, standard single point positioning error, DOP value, signal-to-noise ratio, and multi-path effect. The results show that: (1) In the Asia-Pacific region, the positioning accuracy of Beidou's maritime islands is better than 0.734 m, 0.724 m, and 2.115 m in the N, E, and U directions, respectively, which is basically equivalent to GPS. Whereas, it is roughly 3 m, 3 m and 6 m lower than GPS outside the Asia-Pacific region, and the average number of visible satellites of Beidou in ANMG station and SOLO station is 15 and 11 respectively, which presumably means that the satellite density of Beidou system in the Asia-Pacific region is higher. (2) The average values of signal-to-noise ratio and multipath error of C22, C23, C24 and C25 stars of BeiDou are 41.638 dBHz and 0.574 m, respectively, which are basically comparable to those of G01, G02, G03 and G04 stars of GPS.

"space-based global maritime surveillance. part i: satellite technologies","2021","Maritime surveillance (MS) is crucial for search and rescue operations, fishery monitoring, pollution control, law enforcement, migration monitoring, and national security policies. Since the early days of seafaring, MS has been a critical task for providing security in human coexistence. Several generations of sensors providing detailed maritime information have become available for large offshore areas in real time: maritime radar sensors in the 1950s and the automatic identification system (AIS) in the 1990s among them. However, ground-based maritime radars and AIS data do not always provide a comprehensive and seamless coverage of the entire maritime space. Therefore, the exploitation of space-based sensor technologies installed on satellites orbiting around the earth, such as satellite AIS data, synthetic aperture radar, optical sensors, and global navigation satellite systems reflectometry, becomes crucial for MS and to complement the existing terrestrial technologies.

We prove that the RF/FSO communication in the proposed relay-based architecture enhances the data transmission increasing the throughput and the real-time reception capacity and reducing the network energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the DF scheme overcomes the AF one in terms of energy consumption while the AF scheme overcomes the DF one in terms of probability detection, both experience the same throughput.

"wireless channel models for maritime communications","2018","Recently, broadband maritime communication has attracted much attention due to the rapid development of blue economy. In addition to the conventional MF/HF/VHF bands, there has been increasing interests in the utilization of higher frequency bands to provide broadband data service to the sea area. To design efficient maritime communication systems, the first and a fundamental requirement is to develop a framework to understand the wireless channels. In an integrated air-ground-sea communications network, there are two major type of channels to be investigated, namely the air-to-sea channel (e.g., for communication links from the aircraft-based base stations or relays) and the near-sea-surface channel (for land-to-ship/ship-to-land or ship-to-ship communications). Due to the unique features of the maritime propagation environment such as sparse scattering, sea wave movement, and the ducting effect over the sea surface, the modeling of these maritime channel links differs from conventional terrestrial wireless channels in many aspects and, consequently, will result in significant impact on the transceiver design. In this survey, we highlight the most notable differences from the modeling perspective as well as the channel characteristics for the air-to-sea and near-sea-surface channel links, with more focus on the latter. After a thorough review of existing modeling approaches and measurement campaigns, we conclude that the sparse and the location-dependent properties constitute the most important and distinctive characteristics of the maritime wireless channels. As such, we further remark on the challenges and research topics for future development of maritime communications.","evaporation duct,beyond line-of-sight,Wireless communication,Sea measurements,channel model,Channel models,Fading channels,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,finite scattering,Maritime communications,"
"security in iot-enabled digital twins of maritime transportation systems","2023","The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this modelâ€™s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the systemâ€™s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication security,telecommunication power management,Maritime Transportation System,Transportation,secure maritime transportation,historical transportation data,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,intelligent maritime transportation,Marine vehicles,maritime transportation DTs model,data transmission paths,relay nodes,IoT-enabled digital twins,Radio frequency,Maritime Silk Road,digital twins,comprehensive operational security,outage probability analysis,Relays,digitalization,relay cooperation IoT,node secrecy rate,communication performance,wireless channels,safety performance,relay security analysis,system performance,system security performance,cooperative communication,probability,Digital Twins Internet,data transmission power,Sensors,relay cooperation,Digital twins,Security,maritime transportation system,maritime silk road,"

"aoi-oriented content caching and updating in maritime internet of things","2022","Caching popular contents at the base station (BS) in maritime Internet of Things (IoT) networks makes sensor nodes be free from frequently responding to user requests, which can remarkably save the energy consumption of sensor nodes. However, to ensure the freshness of contents, cached contents need to be updated periodically. Frequent content updating can minimize the age of information (AoI) of contents while increase the energy consumption of sensor nodes. To make a better tradeoff between the AoI and energy consumption, in this paper, both the cache placement and content updating interval are jointly optimized to minimize the weighted sum of AoI of contents and energy consumption of sensor nodes. As the formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, the cache placement and the content updating interval are alternatively optimized. For the cache placement problem, a local optimal solution is achieved via the binary constraint reformulation and successive convex approximation. For the content updating problem, the optimal solution with semi-closed form is derived.

"a novel concept for a satellite-based maritime search and rescue system","1977","Search and rescue (SAR) for both airborne and maritime vehicles has been an area of intense investigation for many years. Current techniques include employment of small distress transmitters which provide signals that have only a limited interception capability. This can considerably increase the search time and reduce its effectiveness. With the increased availability-existing and planned-of both synchronous and nonsynchronous satellites, SAR investigations are being directed toward the application of satellites. The present paper introduces the concept of satellite-based maritime search and rescue system (SAMSARS). This is a proposed pseudonoise (PN) wide-band spread spectrum system that would operate at low power levels and coexist with operational communication satellite systems (voice or data) without mutual interference. The use of existing operational satellite spectrum, instead of a dedicated distress channel or special satellites, is a major feature of SAMSARS. Other important aspects are its capability of providing unique identification and distress information in minutes following activation of the distress transmitter and its inherent immunity to false alarms. SAMSARS can also provide position location directly when three satellites are mutually visible or indirectly, by taking advantage of a vessel's on-board derived navigation data. This paper presents concept elements such as message structure, transmitter and receiver block diagrams, and unique features of SAMSARS. The paper also presents an operational example, including sample link power budgets, and finally specifies areas for further investigation.","Frequency,Wideband,Radio transmitters,Radio position measurement,multiaccess,Costs,Interference,Spread spectrum communication,Satellite communication,Artificial satellites,Vehicles,Spread-spectrum communications,Satellite broadcasting,Pseudonoise-coded communication,Employment,Marine-vehicle communication,"
"biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme for maritime cognitive radio networks","2018","Spectrum sensing is imperative to the success of maritime cognitive radio networks (MCRNs). Spectrum sensing in MCRNs is challenging because of the sea surface movement, the channel interference, and the unstable link quality. Recent research reveals that existing spectrum sensing schemes work well for lower sea states; however, they have failed to perform effectively at higher sea states. There are two disadvantages of performing spectrum sensing at higher sea states: 1) low probability of detection may also cause interference with primary system and 2) energy wastage. In this paper, a biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme (BIC3S) is proposed to deal with the reliability and energy consumption challenges associated with the sea environment. It is based on the task allocation model of an insect colony. The proposed BIC3S chooses participating secondary users for cooperative spectrum sensing according to their given sea state. Further, it enables the secondary users to decide whether or not to perform spectrum sensing based on their sea state. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of energy consumption, detection performance, and throughput. It is shown that the proposed BIC3S consumes less energy and, at the same time, achieves higher detection probability and fewer probability of false alarms compared to the existing schemes. Moreover, BIC3S provides better adaptation capabilities for the sea environment.","telecommunication network reliability,cooperative detection,cognitive radio,BIC3S,Cognitive radio network,maritime cognitive radio networks,Marine vehicles,channel interference,energy wastage,radio spectrum management,Wireless communication,task allocation model,higher sea states,unstable link quality,detection probability,low probability-of-detection,sea surface movement,sea environment,biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme,Entropy,Sea state,radio networks,maritime communication,detection performance,Biology,insect colony,cooperative communication,signal detection,probability,energy consumption,marine communication,MCRN,spectrum sensing,Detectors,"

"precise localization for achieving next-generation autonomous navigation: state-of-the-art, taxonomy and future prospects","2020","Achieving full autonomy in navigation is a complicated problem. The most widely used solution takes up the modular framework for sensing and information processing such as perception, mapping, control, planning and decision making. However, this approach misses the capability of environmental understanding. Hence, to achieve full autonomy in navigation a computing model with self-learning capability inspired by biological intelligence such as memorizing, inferring and experience update is essential for dynamic and noisy environments. Recent advanced sensing, communication and hardware miniaturization technologies achieved few autonomous operations in commercial systems but the full autonomy has not been attained yet. In this paper, the effect of precise and accurate localization for autonomous navigation technologies is extensively studied and the problems and limitations of the related algorithms are analyzed. The major limitations for precise localization are computational complexity, sensor noise and communication delays. These limitations further reduce perception and planning capabilities of autonomous navigation systems. From this study, the future prospects are outlined to achieve a higher level of autonomy by precise localization.","Sensor fusion,Autonomous system,AUV,Network localization,Autonomous mobile robots,Navigation,Localization,Perception,Micro air vehicle,Mapping,UAV,Sensing,"

"noma-based hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial networks for 6g maritime coverage","2023","Current fifth-generation (5G) networks do not cover maritime areas, causing difficulties in developing maritime Internet of Things (IoT). To tackle this problem, we establish a nearshore network by collaboratively using on-shore terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These TBSs and UAVs form virtual clusters in a user-centric manner. Within each virtual cluster, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted for agilely including various maritime IoT devices, which are sparsely distributed over the vast ocean. The nearshore network also shares the spectrum with marine satellites. In such a NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network, interference among different network segments, different clusters, and different users occurs. We thereby formulate a joint power allocation problem to maximize the sum rate of the network. Different from existing studies, we use large-scale channel state information (CSI) only for optimization to reduce system overhead. The large-scale CSI is obtained by using the position information of maritime IoT devices. The problem is non-convex with intractable non-linear constraints. We tackle these difficulties by adopting max-min optimization, the auxiliary function method, and the successive convex approximation technique. An iterative power allocation algorithm is accordingly proposed, which is shown to be effective for coverage enhancement by simulations. This shows the potential of NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks for maritime on-demand coverage.","Satellites,array signal processing,6G maritime coverage,nonorthogonal multiple access,remotely operated vehicles,Internet of Things,joint power allocation problem,maritime IoT devices,convex programming,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),virtual cluster,Resource management,NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks,interference,concave programming,maritime Internet,NOMA,minimax techniques,power allocation,marine satellites,optimisation,tethered unmanned aerial vehicles,maritime on-demand coverage,maritime areas,maritime Internet of Things,user-centric manner,satellite-UAV-terrestrial network,radiofrequency interference,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,on-shore terrestrial base stations,TBSs,nearshore network,nonlinear programming,multi-access systems,Interference,different network segments,MIMO communication,approximation theory,resource allocation,Precoding,UAVs,Hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network,"
"uav-enabled accompanying coverage for hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial maritime communications","2019","Despite of constantly-developing satellites and terrestrial fifth generation (5G) communications, there is still a large gap for maritime broadband coverage. In this paper, we explore the potential gain of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for maritime communications. A hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network is considered, where the UAV is employed to offer an accompanying coverage for mobile ships. We optimize both the trajectory and transmit power of UAV to maximize the minimum of ship's achievable rate. Different from previous studies, we consider a typical composite channel model containing both large-scale and small-scale fading, to cope with the practical propagation environment. Moreover, we assume only the large-scale channel state information (CSI) is known for optimization, because the dynamic small-scale fading cannot be obtained before UAV's flight, whereas the large-scale CSI can be estimated according to the position information of ships. Under this context, an optimization problem is formulated, subject to constraints on UAV's kinematics and communication limitation. We solve the problem which is proved to be non-convex by problem decomposition, successive convex optimization and bisection searching tools. Simulation results have corroborated the superiority of the proposed accompanying coverage of UAV.","Satellites,unmanned aerial vehicles,UAV flight,composite channel model,large-scale CSI,convex programming,Marine vehicles,Wireless communication,concave programming,5G mobile communication,ships,large-scale channel state information,communication limitation,dynamic small-scale fading,satellite-UAV-terrestrial network,wireless channels,autonomous aerial vehicles,satellites,Optimization,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,terrestrial fifth generation communications,marine communication,hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial maritime communications,maritime broadband coverage,mobile ships,Interference,MIMO communication,fading channels,"

However, because of the mobility of the vessels/ships and the large inter-ship distances, nodes in the maritime network are frequently disconnected, forcing data communication in the maritime mesh networks to be opportunistic and delay-tolerant. In this paper, we present LanePost, an optimization approach for maritime delay-tolerant routing protocol. We exploit the shipping lane information to predict the rendezvous opportunities of the ships to optimize the route selection in delay-tolerant routing. In particular, we show that when the shipping lane information is available, an opportunistic routing graph (ORG) for each ship can be constructed to predict its multi-hop data routing opportunities to the other ships or to the shore. Based on the ORG, we develop an optimal route protocol (i.e., LanePost) for each ship to minimize its delay of multi-hop packet delivery via dynamic programming. We discussed the ways of collecting shipping lane information by centralized method or distributed method. The proposed LanePost protocol was evaluated by ONE, an open-source delay-tolerant network simulator, which shows its dramatic performance improvement in terms of delay reduction compared to the state-of-the-art opportunistic routing protocols.","radio links,maritime,wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,delay-tolerant,Delays,Mesh networks,routing protocols,ORG,delay minimization,waterway networks,trafficlane,Routing protocols,opportunistic routing graph,Internet service,data communication,ships,intership distance,route selection,centralized method,maritime multihop mesh network,LanePost protocol,shipping lane information,multihop packet delivery delay,delay-tolerant maritime network,dynamic programming,Spread spectrum communication,graph theory,ship-to-shore radio link,opportunistic routing,distributed method,on-ship user,open-source delay-tolerant network simulator,delay reduction,optimization approach,lane-based optimal routing protocol,Routing,delay tolerant networks,ship-to-ship radio link,marine communication,vessel-ship mobility,multihopnetworks,"
"maritime logistics and applications of information technologies","2010","Due to the globalization, international logistics becomes to rely more on the maritime transportation than ever before. This presentation discusses various research issues in field of maritime logistics and various cases of applications of IT to container terminals. The issues include port logistics, container transportation, and maritime transportation systems. Various research topics on the optimization of maritime logistics are introduced in more detail, including topics on the design and operation container terminals, empty container management, the design and operation of container transportation systems. Some approaches to solve the problems, which have been developed in Korea, will be introduced. We also introduce the case of investigating new pervasive computing technologies of RFID, RTLS, and mesh networking for improving the efficiency of container port terminals. Unfortunately, container terminal is a harsh environment in which wireless communication would be unstable. To address these challenges, a case of developing the mesh network protocol based real time locating system is introduced for building smart container terminal management. For collecting real-time information of RFID tags, RTLS tags, and sensor tags, it is required to implement an integrated middleware platform which is mainly used to realize synchronization of port logistics. It will be shown that a new breakthrough of optimizing the port logistics can be achieved for realizing smart container terminals with the help of the integrated middleware platform for supporting RFID, RTLS, and sensor tags altogether.Due to the globalization, international logistics becomes to rely more on the maritime transportation than ever before.

"distribution function for continental and maritime fog environments for optical wireless communication","2008","Free Space Optics (FSO) links in the troposphere are highly dependent on different atmospheric effects, which vary according to different climatic conditions. For terrestrial FSO links, fog is the most critical of all atmospheric effects causing optical signal attenuations up to 480 dB/km in dense maritime fog environments and 130 dB/km in moderate continental fog environments. In this paper a brief analysis of modified gamma Particle Size Distribution (PSD) parameters for dense maritime fog and moderate continental fog is presented and discussed on the basis of standard reference data available. Moreover, an effort was made to briefly analyse and compare our measured continental and maritime fog attenuation data on the basis of Mie scattering parameters and the standard modified gamma PSD parameters, in order to estimate the values of modified gamma parameters and the total attenuation for the two kinds of fog environments.","optical signal attenuations,drop size distribution (DSD),Free space optical communications,atmospheric optics,fog attenuation,optical links,fog,Scattering,Attenuation,Mie scattering,distribution function,optical wireless communication,size parameter,terrestrial FSO links,Attenuation measurement,free space optical links,marine communication,visibility,Optical scattering,Wavelength measurement,optical attenuators,Optical attenuators,atmospheric effects,continental-maritime fog environments,gamma particle size distribution,"
"the maritime satellite communication channel--channel model, performance of modulation and coding","1987","Towards the year 2000, maritime satellite communications using the INMARSAT system will employ a second and third generation of satellites and new ship earth stations (SES). The new SES standards will use very small antennas with gains between 0 and 15 dBi. At the lower end of SES there will be no antenna stabilization. The communication channel for such small stations is described by a model including multipath fading, Doppler shift, and noise. The results of an extensive measurement program were used to determine the parameters of the channel model, which depend on antenna type and elevation angle. Analytical calculations as well as synthetic and stored channel hardware simulations have been used to determine the performance of several modulation schemes. A complete data link using PSK modems with AFC/Costas loop, interleaving, and FEC codecs at 1.2 kbits/s was built up around a hardware maritime channel simulator, to study the performance of data transmission on the small SES maritime channel. Theoretical and measured results are given for interleaved Viterbi decoding with channel state information and Reed-Solomon codes. The measurements show that with interleaved FEC schemes, the requiredE_{b}/N_{o}for a BER 10-5is in the range of 9-15 dB and the effects of multipath fading are almost compensated for.","Satellite ground stations,Fading,propagation,Modulation coding,Satellite communication,Communication channels,Artificial satellites,Antenna measurements,Error-correction coding,Marine vehicles,Doppler shift,Marine-vehicle communication,Hardware,"

"the regulation of civilian drones' impacts on public safety","2014","Because they are airborne artefacts, drones embody threats to people and property, even in normal operation, but especially when malfunctions occur in equipment or in the data communications on which they are heavily dependent. Some natural controls exist over inappropriate drone behaviour. General liability laws provide remedies for harm that arises from drones, and act as a deterrent against irresponsible behaviour. Specific air safety laws do, or may, apply to drones. Co-regulatory mechanisms provide protections, as may industry and organisational self-regulation. However, a review of current and emergent regulatory arrangements identifies a considerable range of gaps and uncertainties that need to be addressed, particularly in relation to small drones, including micro-drones.","RPA,UAV,Drone,Self-regulation,Aviation safety,Technology-neutrality,Co-regulation,"

"an energy-efficient machine-type communication for maritime internet of things","2020","The Internet of Things (IoT) is an enabler technology for smart maritime networks. Connected IoT systems require reliable machine-type communication (MTC). However, maritime MTC is facing several practical challenges including the wide-area coverage, ubiquitous connectivity, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. In this paper, we first present a novel wireless communications assisted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) system for maritime MTC. In our approach, UAVs are deployed to provide wide-area coverage, while a network of connected buoys handles data transmission between the UAVs and the on-shore data fusion and control center (DFCC). We propose a handover decision method that eliminates unnecessary handover triggers; thus, reducing the overall energy consumption and ensuring seamless connectivity. We formulate the handover decision method as a constrained optimization problem of maximizing handover efficiency in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), available data rate, residual energy, and buffered data, by identifying the buoy offering optimal connectivity. The optimization problem is solved by a probabilistic based genetic algorithm (GA).

"maritime linked data for situational awareness heterogeneous sensor networks","2021","Maritime heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN), which are widely used in support of marine monitoring, maritime security and safety applications, combine diversified sensing systems and platforms observing the state of environmental features of interest or the status of anthropogenic objects to achieve awareness on the situation. To model the information characteristics of HSN observations for maritime situational awareness (MSA), we developed the MSA-HSN ontology, an integrated semantic model for maritime linked data, specifically observations suiting the requirements of maritime information fusion systems. MSA-HSN integrates established ontologies and models for sensors, observations, measurements, quantities, and occurrents, tailored to MSA applications and requirements. To support the interoperability with existing maritime data models, MSA-HSN is aligned with the relevant aspects of the EUCISE/e-CISE (Common Information Sharing Environment) data models. As a validation use case, in this paper the MSA-HSN ontology is applied to model the information elements of the maritime surveillance system developed within the Interactive Extreme-Scale Analytics and Forecasting (INFORE) project, where different situational views offered by a variegate suite of sensors and platforms are fused using big data analytics to achieve maritime situational awareness for maritime security.

"security analysis of drones systems: attacks, limitations, and recommendations","2020","Recently, the world witnessed a significant increase in the number of used drones, with a global and continuous rise in the demand for their multi-purpose applications. The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people’s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird’s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.","Drones security,Terrorism/counter-Terrorism,Drones security countermeasures techniques,Drones threats and vulnerabilities,Drones forensics,Drone/UAV warfare,UAS,Drones attacks,UAV,UUV,Armed drones,"
"detection of ais messages falsifications and spoofing by checking messages compliance with tdma protocol","2023","Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information. It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Spoofing detection,TDMA protocol,Falsifications detection,Kalman filtering,"
"chapter 5 - food defense","2018","Governments and food manufacturers must consider the possibility that disgruntled individuals, criminals, terrorists, and other antisocial groups may intentionally contaminate food and threaten the safety of the agrifood chain. Also the number of economically motivated acts of intentional food adulteration is on the rise. As unintentional outbreaks of foodborne disease may severely harm sensitive consumers and because food trade is highly interconnected, an attack on one country’s food supply can have global personal, social, economic, and political impacts. Therefore, nations and food producers must take responsibility in protecting the agrifood chain against malicious and economically motivated acts of food tampering. Reducing the likeliness of deliberate contamination of agriculture and food products requires the implementation of food defense strategies. Food defense aims to mitigate the risks and hazards of intentional contamination in food operations by introducing a selection of countermeasures to make vulnerable elements in the agrifood chain/food operation more secure. However, although food defense builds barriers around vulnerable points to prohibit intentional adulteration, it cannot prevent it. Therefore, there is a need for a sensitive surveillance system to detect acts of intentional food contamination quickly, an alert system to recognize an incident involving food, and a program that must prepare the operation in responding to assaults of intentional food contamination. Response includes all measures to quickly and efficiently identify, contain, and minimize the impact of an intentional food contamination incident (e.g., by recall of suspected products), and to allow the food producer to recover and regain normal production levels. Preparedness also includes being trained in adequate risk and crisis communication, as it is what makes a public outrage different from a collaboration when addressing a food defense incident. This book chapter provides guidance to the food industry and public authorities for preventing and tackling intentional acts of food contamination.","food contamination,agroterrorism,chemical agents,foodborne disease,biological agents,food terrorism,"
"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments. Several quantitative and qualitative experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve satisfactory prediction performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.","surveillance,dynamic AIS data,LSTM network,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Internet of Things,smart traffic service improvement,abnormal behavior detection,high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction,intelligent maritime networks,Predictive models,deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction,maritime IoT,deep neural networks,Maritime Internt of Things,deep learning,moving vessels,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,vessel traffic services,AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework,vessel traffic conflict situation modeling,6G mobile communication,maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,spatiotemporal vessel trajectories,revolutionary communication paradigm,long-short-term memory network,Trajectory,trajectory prediction,Navigation,combined satellite-terrestrial AIS,marine vehicles,realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories,unsatisfactory maritime safety,satisfactory prediction performance,"
"complex economic consequence analysis to protect the maritime infrastructure","2022","The marine transportation system (MTS) is a critical part of the nation's supply chain. Malicious actors, natural disasters, pandemics, geo-political events and larger marine casualties such as the 2021 Suez Canal grounding incident can disrupt the MTS and domestic and global supply chains. To date, most research and contingency planning has focused on single-event disruptions such as oil spills or security issues. While supply chains may be resilient enough to cope with a wide variety of single disruptions, aggregated challenges may result in cascading failures. There has been little analysis of the impacts of multiple disruptions that build on each other in complex ways. This suggests that modeling the impact of multiple vector disruptions on multiple MTS targets can help policy makers, business leaders, and others anticipate, plan for, mitigate, and rapidly recover from future complex disruptions. This paper describes an approach to research questions like: What are plausible examples of complex, multi-vector disruptions to the MTS? What could make their outcomes more complicated and challenging than those of single disruptions? What are their consequences for different components of the MTS? What are some pre-disruption mitigations and post-disruption resilience tactics that might be useful in such cases? How can we estimate the time to implement them, the costs of implementation, and the reduction of impact of such measures? The project described is developing a framework to address such questions. The framework will be used to analyze the impact of different combinations of individual disruptions, including natural disasters and climate change; security events, including cyber, accidents and marine casualties; and social/political disruptions. The analysis will focus on the total economic consequences of these threat combinations and transition into a user-friendly decision-support tool to improve risk management.","decision support systems,marine accidents,malicious actors,disasters,maritime,supply chain management,marine transportation system,marine casualties,total economic consequences,transportation,individual disruptions,marine navigation,Climate change,2021 Suez Canal grounding incident,security of data,Stakeholders,contingency planning,single-event disruptions,future complex disruptions,politics,Supply chains,pre-disruption mitigations,post-disruption resilience tactics,Maritime communication,maritime infrastructure,oil spills,risk management,user-friendly decision-support tool,economic consequences,resilience,MTS targets,supply chain,global supply chains,natural disasters,multivector disruptions,disruptions,security events,US Department of Homeland Security,complex economic consequence analysis,geo-political events,supply chains,Time measurement,Security,multiple vector disruptions,mitigation,Marine transportation,"

An efficient solution to tackle this problem is adopting an Information-Centric Networking (ICN) approach. ICN is based here on Named Data Networking (NDN), which is one of the most efficient ICN approaches.

"security and qos issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: a tutorial","2022","The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics.

"environment-aware coverage optimization for space-ground integrated maritime communications","2020","To satisfy the growing demand for broadband maritime communications, space-ground integrated maritime communication networks (MCNs) arise, which are envisioned to take full advantage of both satellites and terrestrial shore-based networks. In practice, due to the frequent beam hopping of satellites and the limited number of geographically available onshore base-station sites, the space-ground integrated MCN usually presents a highly non-cellular network structure, leading to both challenging blind zones and coverage areas with severe interference. In this paper, we optimize the coverage performance by exploiting the marine environment information. Particularly, the transmit antenna correlation is estimated using the location and mobility information of scatterers on the sea, such as lighthouses, reefs, islands, and vessels. The position and attitude information of satellites are also utilized for interference estimation. Based on that, we optimize the input covariance and precoding matrix to maximize the ergodic sum capacity for all mobile terminals within the coverage. It is a complicated non-convex problem, especially because the ergodic sum capacity is difficult to be expressed straightly without the expectation operator. We introduce an upper bound of the ergodic sum capacity using the path loss and the transmit antenna correlation estimated from the environment information, and then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem by solving a set of convex subproblems. The proposed environment-aware scheme is evaluated using the real-world geographic information of a coastal area of China. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the ergodic sum capacity and the energy efficiency compared with existing approaches, and achieve dynamic coverage to match the non-cellular network structure.","Satellites,complicated nonconvex problem,ergodic sum capacity maximization,space-ground integrated MCN,Antenna arrays,matrix algebra,input covariance optimization,convex programming,path loss,non-cellular,environment-aware coverage optimization,Transmitting antennas,concave programming,coverage performance optimization,beam hopping,space-ground integrated maritime communications,dynamic coverage,environment-aware scheme,precoding matrix,scatterer mobility information,precoding,Maritime communications,broadband maritime communications,Propagation losses,satellite-based networks,real-world geographic information,Correlation,radiofrequency interference,terrestrial shore-based networks,coverage optimization,transmitting antennas,satellite antennas,iterative methods,noncellular network structure,Optimization,onshore base-station sites,broadband networks,marine environment information,marine communication,attitude information,interference estimation,upper bound,transmit antenna correlation,Interference,iterative algorithm,mobile terminals,energy efficiency,"
"enhancing ais to improve whale-ship collision avoidance and maritime security","2009","Whale-ship strikes are of growing worldwide concern due to the steady growth of commercial shipping. Improving the current situation involves the creation of a communication capability allowing whale position information to be estimated and exchanged among vessels and other observation assets. An early example of such a system has been implemented for the shipping lane approaches to the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts where ship traffic transits areas of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary frequently used by whales. It uses the Automated Identification Systems (AIS) technology, currently required for larger vessels but becoming more common in all classes of vessels. However, we believe the default mode of AIS operation will be inadequate to meet the long-term needs of whale-ship collision avoidance, and will likewise fall short of meeting other current and future marine safety and security communication needs. This paper explores the emerging safety and security needs for vessel communications, and considers the consequences of a communication framework supporting asynchronous messaging that can be used to enhance the basic AIS capability. The options we analyze can be pursued within the AIS standardization process, or independently developed with attention to compatibility with existing AIS systems. Examples are discussed for minimizing ship interactions with Humpback Whales and endangered North Atlantic Right Whales on the east coast, and North Pacific Right Whales, Bowhead Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales and Beluga Whales in west coast, Alaskan and Hawaiian waters.","marine accidents,North Atlantic right Whales,Whale-ship collision avoidance,Communication system security,Standardization,Marine vehicles,vessel communications,maritime security,Sea measurements,Whale position information,AIS technology,Humpback Whales,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Collision avoidance,Oceans,Beluga Whales,Boston,automated identification systems technology,North Pacific Right Whales,Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary,Economic forecasting,AIS enhancement,Marine technology,Bowhead Whales,Marine safety,Massachusetts,collision avoidance,Blue Whales,Whales,"

"benchmarking of emulated wireless edge cloud connectivity for maritime environments","2022","Remote ship pilotage, smart fairway navigation, autonomous maritime transport and smart maritime logistics present new challenges to the maritime industry. One of the challenges is increasing dependency on reliable network connectivity that can range from low priority entertainment communications to high priority safety critical communications. Traffic prioritization is needed at the open sea, where ships typically resort to expensive satellite connectivity that incurs long latency and narrow bandwidth. Near the coastline, ships can switch to 5G-based communications with low latency and high bandwidth, and possibly even utilize low-latency edge computing capabilities. Our contribution in this paper is a cloud-based networking testbed that supports network traffic shaping to emulate satellite and 5G-based communications between an edge cloud located onboard a ship and another edge cloud located onboard another ship or at the shore under traffic loss scenarios. Potential use-cases for our work include emulation of peer-to-peer communications (i.e., ship-to-ship or ship-to-shore) and mesh networking.

"satellite multicast transmission scheme in integrated satellite-maritime networks","2020","This paper proposes a maritime transmission scheme in integrated satellite-maritime networks, where the satellite multicast and relay cooperation cooperatively provide the ubiquitous broadband coverage for the whole sea area. Under the proposed network, the maritime users that request the same content or belong to the same fleet can be divided into one user group. Besides, the satellite provides multicast services for the all user groups, while the relay nodes retransmit the signal to other users to reduce the satellite communication cost of user group. However, since the network performance is strongly correlated with satellite links and relay nodes, it is difficult to find out the optimal cooperation solution with low complexity. Meanwhile, the user groups work in the same carrier frequency, which inevitably causes the co-channel interferences among groups. Considering these factors, we propose a cooperative access and power allocation algorithms, respectively. The cooperative access algorithm is based on channel quality and considers the channel quality of satellite and relay node simultaneously. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effective improve system performance compared with existing scheme.","Satellites,multicast communication,satellite communication cost reduction,Resource management,ubiquitous broadband coverage,satellite-maritime networks,maritime transmission scheme,cooperative access algorithm,Relays,power allocation,relay node,signal retransmission,access selection,optimal cooperation solution,relay networks (telecommunication),Satellite broadcasting,cochannel interferences,power allocation algorithm,Optimization,maritime users,integrated satellite-maritime networks,satellite links,cooperative communication,marine communication,Multicast,multicast services,cochannel interference,Signal to noise ratio,relay cooperation,Interference,satellite multicast transmission scheme,resource allocation,user group,"

"enabling the maritime internet of things: coap and 6lowpan performance over vhf links","2018","The dissemination of digital devices across the seas and oceans of the world is becoming a reality, laying the foundations for sophisticated operations such as autonomous shipping or exposed fish-farming. This reflects the importance of maritime regions as well as the growing demand for more data and knowledge in these remote areas. Currently, the presence of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in offshore settings is limited by the lack of infrastructures, with communications being typically decoupled from the standard Internet or relying on expensive satellite solutions. This paper proposes integrating a commonly available maritime radio-technology, namely very high frequency (VHF) communications, with protocols used in the Internet of Things (IoT). By using the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks and the constrained application protocol (CoAP), interoperability is ensured between already existing maritime systems and the Internet. An experimental setup is evaluated under different settings and using different configurations. In addition, an analytical assessment of the solutionsâ€™ reliability is presented. The obtained results prove the feasibility of using IoT protocols over a VHF link and demonstrate that such an approach outperforms IPv4-based solutions. The conducted assessment reveals that, in constrained settings, configurations at the application layer (e.g., CoAPâ€™s block size in Block-wise transfers) strongly impact the overall performance and reliability of the system. This motivates the development of new maritime solutions based on IPv6 for ensuring a sustainable and ubiquitous development of ICTs even in the most remote locations.","Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPANs),IP fragmentation,very high frequency (VHF) devices,Protocols,Personal area networks,IP networks,maritime communication,Internet of Things (IoT),Low-power electronics,Internet of Things,Computer network reliability,Wireless personal area networks,"

"small vessel tracking using ais for enhanced maritime domain awareness","2017","Fishing has the highest rate of occupational fatalities in the USA, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Alaska's waters are the deadliest, per Coast Guard statistics [1]. Many fishing fatalities stem from small boats, 44 feet in length or less. Small boats can sink or tip for many reasons including bad weather, rough seas, mechanical problems and poor maintenance. Some operators will cut corners on equipment or maintenance to save money, and economic pressures force many to stay at sea longer to increase their catch, despite needed repairs or encroaching bad weather. There are also fewer enforced safety regulations and training for small fishing boats and crews. Mandates have been established to track large commercial ships using Automated Identification System (AIS) and Vessel Management System (VMS), but these mandates do not address the huge population of smaller boats. In addition to safety concerns, smaller boats that remain unidentified (or â€œdark targetsâ€) may pose a security risk. Equipping small boats with proper safety and tracking equipment is not always easy. Small fishing and commercial work boats may not have the necessary shipboard power or infrastructure to support current AIS devices or VMS solutions. Smaller vessels can also spend a considerable amount of time outside of any shore-based tracking coverage (e.g. via terrestrial AIS or Global System for Mobile Communications [GSM]). Typical mobile satellite communications (satcom) tracking options can be prohibitively costly (equipment and air-time) and normally require on-board power. This paper describes a new system that utilizes low-cost battery and solar powered transponders for both terrestrial and satellite AIS (dual-mode) messaging, and specialized algorithms and software, to provide an affordable and practical solution to reliably track small boats. Methods have been implemented, preliminary results have been collected and additional sea trials are currently underway.","Satellites,tracking equipment,enhanced maritime domain awareness,Safety,dark targets,transponders,Automated Identification System,Sea measurements,Global System for Mobile Communications,Coast Guard statistics,ships,marine safety,small vessel tracking,fishing boats,boats,fishing fatalities,occupational fatalities,terrestrial AIS,current AIS devices,Artificial intelligence,size 44.0 feet,Satellite broadcasting,mobile satellite communications tracking options,enforced safety regulations,mandates,mobile satellite communication,tracking coverage,Boats,commercial work boats,Vessel Management System,satellite AIS,safety concerns,shipboard power,sea trials,"

"instantaneous global navigation satellite system (gnss)-based attitude determination for maritime applications","2012","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a valuable technology for a large number of maritime applications. Other than providing the absolute positioning service, it aids many demanding applications, such as precise docking, formation of surface craft, autonomous vehicles, sinkage monitoring, etc. GNSS carrier-phase-based algorithms provide high-precision positioning solutions, but an integer number of cycles inherent to the observed signal have to be resolved. A newly developed GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity resolution method is tested. The new method solves for the unknown number of integer cycles by exploiting the known placement of the GNSS antennas aboard the vessel. The a priori information on the antennas baseline separation is employed as a hard constraint. A simplified (linearized) version of the method, suitable for large vessels, is also analyzed. The new method was tested against the most challenging scenario when processing GNSS data: single-frequency, single-epoch, unaided ambiguity resolution. Through different tests, the high performance of the new method is demonstrated: high fixing rate, large robustness, and short time-to-fix after initialization, cycle slips, and/or loss of locks. Considerations about the wide spectra of maritime applications are given, and a specific experiment is carried out to demonstrate the capabilities of the method for navigation in shallow waters.","Antennas,shipborne attitude,Position measurement,Vectors,high-precision positioning,Marine vehicles,sinkage monitoring,under-keel clearance (UKC),instantaneous global navigation satellite system,satellite navigation,GNSS antennas,Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),Ambiguity resolution,carrier-phase ambiguity resolution,maritime applications,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,Minimization,marine communication,attitude determination,Estimation,constrained least squares,"
"fading modeling in maritime container terminal environments","2018","In this paper, an analytical model for slow and fast fading effects in maritime container terminals is derived, from fitting distributions to the results of measurements performed in an actual operational environment. The proposed model is composed of a set of equations, enabling to evaluate fading statistical distribution parameters for different system and environments conditions, as a function of frequency, base station antenna height, and average height of container stacks in a deepwater container terminal. The model's coefficients were obtained from a multivariate linear regression of the fitted distributions parameters, allowing to evaluate the different statistical distribution parameters with a negligible mean error and a standard deviation of the error less than 0.65 dB. It is observed that a good fitting is obtained for slow fading with the Lognormal Distribution, the standard deviation ranging in [1.40, 4.81] dB, while fast fading is well modeled by the Nakagami Distribution with the standard deviation ranging in [0.43, 1.26].

Deep learning (DL) has been recognized as very promising for solving bottlenecks in the evolution of next generation communication systems.

Although deep-sea satellite connections will enable 6G networks, however due to limited service capacity owing to the long propagation delay between end-user and satellites. We propose unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial backhauling and a relay medium in the marine communication network assisted by satellites and coastal base stations (BSs). The power allocation strategy of multi-satellites for a 6G network is investigated in this work. The power allocation problem is non-convex, hence deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to solve it instead of the conventional optimization technique. Our research aims to optimize the networkâ€™s total capacity in the case when the satellites are randomly and densely dispersed. We provide a deep neural network and a method for mapping wireless power allocation for multi-satellites. The proposed technique can achieve a better overall capacity in comparison to the water-filling and the Q-learning method. The simulation results further demonstrate that the suggested technique offers a notable increase in stability and convergence speed.","Satellites,telecommunication network reliability,unmanned aerial vehicles,deep neural network,maritime end-users,maritime traffic,sixth-generation communication networks,deep learning (artificial intelligence),service capacity,6G,telecommunication computing,deep-sea satellite connections,long propagation delay,Power system stability,Wireless communication,6G maritime networks framework,power allocation problem,power allocation strategy,deep reinforcement learning,marine users,network outages,conventional optimization technique,mission-critical applications,Q-learning method,multisatellites,6G mobile communication,reinforcement learning,Power distribution,satellite networks,autonomous aerial vehicles,wireless power allocation,satellites,deep-sea waters,end-user,aerial backhauling,marine communication,Deep learning,marine communication network,Spectral efficiency,learning (artificial intelligence),resource allocation,high data speeds,coastal base stations,"
"5g for deployable and maritime communications","2021","Mission networks in support of NATO expeditionary and maritime operations demand high capacity and reliable, yet easy to deploy and operate, communication solutions. Emerging 5G technologies towards IMTâ€“2020 vision are poised to push the technology limits and enable new applications in many industry verticals and the military is no exception. ACT and NCI Agency have been investigating the potential of 5G technologies for military applications and have identified a number of scenarios where 5G technologies could bring an advantage to the warfighter.

"measurement-based wideband maritime channel characterization","2023","Maritime communication is one of the 5G vertical domains and is attracting more attention. Advanced channel models that accurately characterize the wideband maritime propagation channels are essential for the development of modern maritime communication technologies. To this end, we measured the propagation channel at 5.6GHz with a sailing boat, capturing the channel with a bandwidth of 250MHz, both in the harbor and the open sea. Based on the measurement results, we evaluated the Rician K-factor, coherence bandwidth and path loss. We concluded that in the maritime environment various types of power delay profiles can occur, and that the Rician K-factor and coherence bandwidth can vary significantly within a short period of time.","Sea measurements,Wireless communication,propagation,Channel estimation,Loss measurement,Coherence,maritime communication,parameter estimation,Channel measurement,Antenna measurements,Rician channels,"
"two-timescale beam selection and power allocation for maritime offshore communications","2021","In this letter, beam selection and power allocation are investigated for maritime offshore communications. Considering the slow-changing network topology and the line-of-sight (LOS) dominant propagation of land-sea links, we define a beam configuration period (BCP) as a time span to contain numerous coherence intervals (CIs), and provide a two-timescale design by enforcing the long-term beam selection strategy and the short-term power allocation scheme only once in every BCP and in every CI, respectively. Since the beamforming configurations are updated much less frequently, the training overhead could be considerably reduced. Numerical results indicate that the proposed two-timescale design avoids heavy training overhead, and thus effectively enhances the performance of offshore communications.","line-of-sight dominant propagation,beam configuration period,array signal processing,two-timescale design,Maritime offshore communication,maritime offshore communications,Marine vehicles,coherence intervals,Resource management,beam selection,telecommunication network topology,Quality of service,power allocation,Network topology,long-term beam selection strategy,beamforming configurations,short-term power allocation scheme,BCP,Indexes,Training,marine communication,network topology,Downlink,two-timescale beam selection,land-sea links,resource allocation,numerous coherence intervals,"

"adaptive shipborne base station sleeping control for dynamic broadband maritime communications","2017","Increasing marine activities taking place within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) have made broadband maritime communications very attractive in recent years. In this paper, a coordinated satellite and terrestrial architecture (II-CST) is presented to implement real-time and broadband Internet access at sea. Further, since the mobility of shipborne base stations (S-BSs) may cause complex inter-cell interference (ICI), an S-BS sleeping control scheme is proposed to adapt the system resource allocation corresponding with the user load. When the proportion of blocked users is beyond threshold, the sleeping control process is triggered to reduce ICI and recover broadband access. Then we use the sailing position of accessed users as a constraint to adjust the downlink power allocation of S-BSs. Simulation results with real ship data of China's Yellow Sea show that under the II-CST, our adaptive S-BS sleeping control can contribute to achievable downlink data rate, mobility robustness, and power efficiency of the dynamic broadband maritime communication system.","Satellites,broadband access,broadband maritime communication,system resource allocation,Marine vehicles,shipborne base stations,Switches,accessed users,Mobile communication,shipborne BS sleeping,inter-cell interference coordination,ICI,sleeping control process,blocked users,dynamic broadband maritime communication system,adaptive shipborne base station sleeping control,ships,power allocation,cellular radio,coordinated satellite,terrestrial architecture,Broadband communication,complex intercell interference,adaptive S-BS sleeping control,China Yellow Sea show,marine activities,Sleep apnea,II-CST,Real-time systems,downlink power allocation,dynamic broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,marine communication,Internet,exclusive economic zone,resource allocation,user load,"

"cfd based autonomous surveillance vessel design for maritime environments","2022","Oceans cover about 70% of Earth's surface and it is difficult to keep them under continuous surveillance with ever increasing criminal activities. Conventional surveillance methods utilize manned vessels to patrol large sea areas, and due to repetitive-monotonous nature, the personnel involved can often make inevitable human errors due to fatigue. As an alternative, solar-charged battery-powered surface vessel that can autonomously navigate in maritime waters is proposed. Autonomous surveillance vessels are required to navigate in oceans for an extended time duration, requiring them to use much power in propulsion. To properly manage propulsion power, the vessel design must minimize the drag acting upon the vessel. In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques are used to identify the most suitable type of vessel shape that can minimize the drag and maximize the lift and stability. According to the simulation results, conventional catamaran gondola vessel type gives better performance over others.","maritime waters,surveillance,Computational fluid dynamics,conventional catamaran gondola vessel type,remotely operated vehicles,extended time duration,computational fluid dynamics,CFD,control facilities,vessel shape,criminal activities,marine systems,propulsion power,Earth's surface,boats,Drag,oceans cover,maritime environments,Shape,computational fluid dynamics techniques,Sea surface,continuous surveillance,conventional surveillance methods,solar-charged battery-powered surface vessel,sea areas,Autonomous Surface Vessel,repetitive-monotonous nature,mobile robots,marine communication,national security,autonomous surveillance vessels,inevitable human errors,Simulation,Navigation,Surveillance,marine vehicles,drag,manned vessels,oceanographic techniques,autonomous surveillance vessel design,"
"increasing long range coverage by multiple antennas for maritime broadband communications","2018","Maritime broadband wireless communications differs to typical in-land broadband. The envisaged environment is either open sea or along coastal areas. On the open sea distance between vessel and shore installations have only limited success. However, broadband communication links between vessels or offshore installations are useful. Satellite links are used to overcome the limited terrestrial coverage with a broadband and high data rate link. However, these links suffer from their huge footprints and therefore, only a portion of the overall data rate is reasonable for a single vessel. Further, delays are significant because of the distance to the satellite even between vessels that are close by. Close to the shore the vessels benefit from the cellular mobile radio links that exist anyhow for terrestrial users on land. However, the continuous tremendous increase of data rate over the evolution of the cellular generation from the 2nd (GSM) to the 3rd (UMTS) and now to the 4th generation (LTE) comes with a cost. The main reasons to increase data rate is the densification of cells and the additional used bandwidth per link. Both together decrease the coverage zones on land and therefore, consequently have shrunk the cell sizes for users on the sea. A new broadband solution that guarantees high and reliable data rates with large coverage zones around the shore is needed to cope with the increasing demands on sea. The demand for high data rates increases by novel on sea applications such as tele-health and telematic. In addition recently, marine robots with networking connectivity are essential in environmental sensing and ocean observation applications [1]. Underwater sensors need to bridge the gap between data transmission limits under water and above water. Either remotely controlled or autonomous surface vehicles could perform as that bridge. However, even distant vehicles need the connectivity to assure the received data is delivered timely.","telecommunication network reliability,cellular generation,maritime broadband communications,cellular mobile radio links,terrestrial coverage,broadband antennas,3G mobile communication,Transmitting antennas,Synchronization,4G mobile communication,cellular radio,OFDM,Broadband communication,offshore installations,wireless communications,Receiving antennas,satellite links,broadband networks,sea applications,marine communication,mobile communication,open sea distance,Long Term Evolution,broadband communication links,"

"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"

Maritime traffic contributes to a very large extent to the trade and exchange of goods between countries and continents. For decades, security on the boat was restricted to fire prevention and the avoidance of pirates. Internet and computer-based systems inside the boats have changed the relative quietness of a ship at sea to deal with new challenges and threats, viruses, cyber attacks, remote operation and control, etc. Even when in a harbor, a ship appears as very vulnerable as it relies on information systems that can be corrupted. Ensuring security and protection of a ship when at sea or by the coastline raise numerous challenges, as the ship design did not anticipate impacts of recent omnipresence of information and communication technologies. In this paper, we present our current platform, its rationale and the initial feedback we have obtained when teaching cyber security and presenting cyber risks. We also detail how we used it to detect potential attacks.","security of data,ship design,SCADA,education,raising awareness,risk management,ICS,maritime traffic,cyber security,fire prevention,computer-based systems,detection of potential attacks,Internet,cyber risks,ships,marine engineering,maritime context,cyber attacks,"
"study on application of channel propagation model for maritime communication","2022","With the implementation of marine power strategy, large scale activities at sea are increasing, and the demand for maritime communication, especially LOS communication and over-the-horizon communication on the sea, is growing, so the role of maritime communication is increasingly prominent to support the activities.

"an efficient and controllable capsule network for classification of maritime moving targets","2023","The accurate classification of maritime moving targets under complex sea conditions is a very important task. And it plays an important role in ensuring the safety of navigation and safeguarding maritime rights and interests and security, and has a wide range of applications in military and civilian fields. At present, there are many methods for related research, but there are still problems such as a large number of parameters and a high computational cost. Based on this, this article proposes a new efficient and controllable capsule network method for maritime moving target classification research. First, a non-iterative attention routing is constructed to reduce the number of parameters and weaken the dependence of the previous capsule layer on the next capsule layer in the routing process. Second, a controllable routing algorithm is proposed, which can reduce the number of routing and computational cost dynamically according to the complexity of samples and has strong flexibility.

In this paper, we aim to achieve efficient and communication fault-tolerant MSAR operations by employing trajectory planning and resource scheduling for heterogeneous units involving observation unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), router UAVs, and rescue ships equipped with mobile edge computing (MEC). Firstly, we model several essential components related to MSAR, including the ocean current environment, UAVs for observing, fault tolerance of routing network, MEC scheduling, and energy consumption of UAVs. Secondly, we formulate the optimization problem into a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) and then introduce the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to search for an optimal joint strategy.

In a maritime network scenario, they can potentially offer solutions close to ports or relatively narrow water channels; over such a multi-hop network one could enable various services ranging from simple file transfers to real-time communication. Concentrating on the latter case, which poses the biggest challenges, we develop and evaluate strategies for dynamic and predictive network resource allocation in order to support Voice over IP. We analyse how the ability to monitor the mobility of seaborne vessels through the Automatic Identification System provides us with a critical advantage in anticipating topology changes.

"a camera-based deep-learning solution for visual attention zone recognition in maritime navigational operations","2022","The visual attention of navigators is imperative to understand the logic of navigation as well as the surveillance of navigators' status and operation. Current studies are implemented with the help of wearable eye-tracker glasses; yet, the high expenditure demanded by such equipment and service and its limitations on usability have impeded related research from further development. In this letter, the authors propose a framework, which is the first attempt in the maritime domain, to provide a camera-based deep-learning (CaBDeeL) visual attention recognition solution that outperforms the intrusive eye tracker regarding its shortcomings. A wide-angle camera is configured in front of the navigator in the advanced ship-bridge simulator in a way that visual attention reflected by their facial and head movements is captured in the front view. A pair of eye-tracker glasses is used to classify the captured visual attention images, which then form the primary database.

"data transmission for maritime and land mobiles using stored channel simulation","1982","Channel simulators with synthetically generated complex multiplicative and additive Gaussian distortions are widely used for investigating non-frequency-selective fading channels. An alternative is to record the channel distortions (i.e. amplitude and phase variations) by probing the real channel and to use these stored signals to control the simulator in the lab. This stored channel method (SCM) has been applied to the following mobile radio channels â€¢ satellite to ship â€¢ SAR emergency buoy to satellite â€¢ base station to land mobile for low data rates A collection of tapes has been obtained for these channels under various conditions. They were used to compare several data transmission schemes at different data rates and various S/N-ratios, but with the same replayed fading fluctuations. The SCM was used to evaluate low rate data transmissions (< 10 Kbit/sec) with various modulation schemes such as CBPSK, digital FM, and DPSK/FM. Bit error rate results are presented.

"joint stochastic prediction of vessel kinematics and destination based on a maritime traffic graph","2022","Maritime traffic increases every year, and therefore also the amount of traffic data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Utilizing these data on traffic patterns and possible destinations for long-term vessel prediction is here an important way of gaining maritime situational awareness (MSA) for use in the decision making in autonomous ships, such as collision avoidance algorithms, which can reduce collision risk during voyage. In this article, we present a destination inference method based on piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes for predicting vessel motions along common traffic lanes toward a set of destinations. The mean velocities of the processes are inferred through the creation of a maritime graph that represents the major traffic patterns in the area of consideration. After using an OU process for prediction along major sea lanes, the Equilibrium Reverting Velocity (ERV) bridging model is used to enable convergence of the prediction towards considered destinations. Then, based on the OU process and ERV bridging model for prediction, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the posterior destination distribution. Tested on a real-time AIS dataset, the method is shown to perform better than current state-of-the art methods in destination inference as it indirectly takes land and passed destinations into account.","Traffic control,mean velocities,Prediction algorithms,vessel kinematics,Bayes methods,equilibrium reverting velocity bridging model,Destination inference,traffic patterns,posterior destination distribution,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,traffic lanes,sea lanes,maritime situational awareness,long-term vessel prediction,piece-wise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,joint stochastic prediction,collision risk,maritime graph,real-time AIS dataset,maritime graphs,traffic data,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,vessel motions,maritime traffic graph,decision making,collision avoidance algorithms,Bayesian inference,Real-time systems,graph theory,ERV bridging model,telecommunication traffic,inference mechanisms,traffic engineering computing,Navigation,collision avoidance,OU process,AIS data,destination inference method,autonomous ships,"
"massive maritime path planning: a contextual online learning approach","2021","The ocean has been investigated for centuries across the world, and planning the travel path for vessels in the ocean has become a hot topic in recent decades as the increasing development of worldwide business trading. Planning such suitable paths is often based on big data processing in cybernetics, while not many investigations have been done. We attempt to find the optimal path for vessels in the ocean by proposing an online learning dispatch approach on studying the missionâ€“executingâ€“feedback (MEF) model. The proposed approach explores the ocean subdomain (OS) to achieve the largest average traveling feedback for different vessels. It balances the ocean path by a deep and wide search, and considers adaptation for these vessels. Further, we propose a contextual multiarmed bandit-based algorithm, which provides accurate exploration results with sublinear regret and significantly improves the learning speed.

"dltif: deep learning-driven cyber threat intelligence modeling and identification framework in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies.

"optimising file delivery in a maritime environment through inter-vessel connectivity predictions","2012","It is well known that the Internet infrastructure is experiencing an ever growing demand for large file/data transfers. To date, Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) seems as the only economically viable over-the-sea communications paradigm to support bulk data transfers between seagoing vessels and the fixed Internet. In this work, we construct an architectural prototype of this DTN overlay to connect sailing vessels to the fixed Internet infrastructure. The proposed architecture integrates elements of the existing vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) to fetch and manipulate mobility and trip related data of every vessel that could come into close contact (at any future instance in time) with a destination node and therefore assist in message forwarding. Considering both current and future contact opportunities all within the same optimization strategy allows for the maximization of routing performance. Ultimately, it is shown that the proposed architecture allows for computationally efficient routing solutions to be generated with variable optimization objectives.

An expected throughput maximization problem is then formulated, where the USV trajectory and power allocation are jointly considered, subject to the constraints of kinematics, safe sailing, line-of-sight (LoS) link distances, power allocation, and information-causality. Due to the complexity of the maritime two-ray signal propagation model, we propose a channel approximation method to find the upper bound of the throughput.

In this paper, we propose an Improved Nearest Point based Location Routing (INPLR) protocol for an intermittently connected MWMN, with a joint consideration of the expected delivery time and sea condition. We first estimate the movement range of the destination, then develop a carrying and forwarding metric (CFM) based on the concept of nearest point. Subsequently, the ship with the minimum value of CFM is selected as the packet carrier. Moreover, the retransmission mechanism is applied to reduce the packet loss. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposal by extensive simulation.

"trial results conducted by multiple canadian government agencies of the recent covert technology developped by tektrap to trace and track the integrity of maritime containers worldwide","2012","iCargo is an easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device combining GPS and door lock tracking with wireless and satellite communications to remotely track the status and position of maritime containers worldwide. A system of strategically placed readers combined with satellite or cellular communications and redundant technologies ensures that security breaches are detected early and reliably anywhere along the supply chain. iCargo provides a GPS trace of where a container has travelled and where the container might have been opened. Deviations from the expected itinerary in time and/or distance are detected and the container can be flagged for physical inspection. Such a system helps borders authorities to focus their energy on suspicious cargo with the overall impact of speeding the flow of all cargo. iCargo uses a patented technique to convert the metal structure of the container into an antenna thereby allowing it to be installed behind the rubber seal of the door in a truly covert fashion. Other technologies are visible from the exterior and vulnerable to tampering and damage during container handling. The location within the door gasket is ideal for monitoring the door open/close status as well as for acting as a communications gateway to optional internal sensors. There are approximately 7 million maritime containers entering/leaving North America every year. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. Such containers may include contraband, hazmats, weapons or illegal items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements since Sept-11th, only 5% of the maritime containers go through physical inspection. The use of the iCargo mounted on a container at the point of departure will assist government authorities in making better decisions about which containers to inspect thereby speeding up the overall throughput of all containers. In today's lean economy, goods in transit do not contribute to economic growth but instead are added costs to customers and shippers. With rising fuel and transportation costs, delays at borders are becoming increasingly expensive. Early detection via the iCargo system will help to reduce these costs by not only helping to shorten inspection delays but by also allowing officials to focus their energy on suspicious cargo thereby improving border security. Tektrap has been selected for the Pool of Pre-qualified Proposals for the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP). CICP is a very competitive program that targets recent innovations, especially in the field of national security, which are ready for the beta phase of product development. Within this award, iCargo will be evaluated during spring and early summer 2012 by Canada Border Services Agency for Canadian-US border application, by Defense Research and Development Canada, DND, for land, rail and air applications in the Canada Nordic environment, and by Transport Canada for trans-Canada land/rail and Asia-Canada sea conditions.

"a survey of mobility-aware multi-access edge computing: challenges, use cases and future directions","2023","Many mobile and pervasive applications avail cloud services to reduce overheads in on-device computation. The performance of these services depends on the available bandwidth of the underlying network, the physical proximity of the cloud server and the end devices, the volume of data, the computational capacity of the server, and, importantly, the mobility of the devices hosting the applications. Edge computing promises to provide better performance by bringing services (e.g., a video streaming service) from the cloud to servers near the user. It also enables partial or full offloading of the computation (tasks) and storage functionalities from the User Equipment (UE) to the edge of the network. This saves power and benefits from relatively more powerful devices at the edge. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which supports wireless and wired access technologies, has gained significant research interest. When UEs move, services must continue to operate, tasks may need to be offloaded again, and states related to tasks and services may need to be migrated. In this paper, we focus on four functional components (task/service offloading, resource allocation, content/task caching, and service/task migration) of MEC. We survey the challenges to these and their solutions in the context of UE mobility. Mobility creates challenges during offloading resource-intensive tasks as the user may move while the task is being offloaded. Some of the other challenges are how to jointly allocate computing and communication resources, minimize service down time during migration, and share the backhaul network if the same MEC host must continue to be used. Some key research areas include intelligent task offloading and service migration algorithms, exploiting group mobility to improve task migration time, studying the interplay of MEC parameters such as capabilities of the target MEC host, etc. In addition, predicting the mobile trajectory through intelligent methods and implementations with datasets from real-world scenarios are required. We compare this paper on 11 parameters (service migration, task offloading, resource allocation, content caching, mobility, use cases, architecture, computing paradigm, mobility model, system model, virtualization/Software Defined Networks) with 31 other survey papers from 2018 to April 2022 in MEC and related domains. We discuss the Edge Computing paradigm, the system architecture and model descriptions, and use cases. We briefly explain the relevant challenges and future directions in emerging domains, such as the Internet of drones and Digital twins. We also discuss future research directions in task/service migration, offloading, resource management, distributed computing, reliability, and Quality of Service, all related to mobility in MEC.","Service migration,Multi-access Edge Computing,Resource allocation,Mobility,Task offloading,Content caching,"
"cooperative collision avoidance study of maritime autonomous surface ship","2021","Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) with the advantage of advanced guidance, navigation, and control capabilities have attracted great attention in recent years. The MASS collect travelling information by the radar, camera, and Autonomous Identification System (AIS) with which it is equipped. Therefore, collision avoidance of MASS turns to be a cooperative and collaborative one by utilizing the interactive information efficiently and effectively. During the collision avoidance procedure of MASS, steering and deceleration are the common actions. In order to receive an efficient and reasonable steering angle and navigation time on the new course, a communication-based real time collaborative collision avoidance decision model is proposed. Firstly, a multi-level communication method is utilized to integrate dynamic information of surrounding vessels. Secondly, a real time collision risk analysis system for MASS is established based on fuzzy logic method. Finally, a collaborative collision avoidance decision system based on the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm is developed to find the optimal steering angle and sailing time on a new course.

"a novel adaptive terahertz system for reliable and efficient maritime communications under hostile sea conditions","2022","Terahertz (THz) frequency band has been widely used in indoor, outdoor and space communications due to its advantage of large available bandwidth. However, limited research has been conducted to apply THz technique in maritime communications as hostile sea conditions cause significant path loss, thus leading to unacceptable signal error rate. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive THz maritime communication system to tackle the above-mentioned challenge. Specifically, we design a joint source-channel coding scheme by using system random linear network coding (sRLNC) and Reed-Solomon (RS) to ensure transmission reliability. To further improve the transmission efficiency, we propose a novel triple-channel communication architecture facilitated by a very high frequency (VHF) feedback channel. With this design, the source data can be transmitted via the THz main channel while the coding redundancy is dispatched in the auxiliary channel. Meanwhile, the feedback channel allows sender to use an adaptive mechanism to achieve the transmission efficiency with higher transmission rate over long communication distance. In addition, we adopt the Doppler frequency offset in maritime environment to compensate both relative movement between communication parties and adversarial maritime factors, e.g., strong wind and extreme sea states. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed THz system has remarkable capability not only to improve the communication efficiency up to 20Gbps compared to those conventional high frequency (HF), VHF and millimeter wave communication systems but also to transmit data over a longer distance with lower BERs.","telecommunication network reliability,feedback,channel coding,long communication distance,above-mentioned challenge,High frequency,Reed-Solomon,millimeter wave communication systems,high frequency feedback channel,terahertz frequency band,joint source-channel coding scheme,Wireless communication,Communication systems,source data,outdoor space communications,Adaptive modulation algorithm,efficient maritime communications,transmission efficiency,adversarial maritime factors,novel adaptive terahertz system,error statistics,Doppler frequency,significant path loss,hostile sea conditions,communication parties,triple-channel communication architecture,transmission reliability,Modulation,network coding,adaptive mechanism,combined source-channel coding,Doppler effect,wireless channels,indoor space communications,extreme sea states,system random linear network coding,higher transmission rate,maritime communication system,Doppler frequency offset,Frequency modulation,unacceptable signal error rate,maritime environment,coding redundancy,marine communication,Adaptive systems,Reed-Solomon codes,communication efficiency up to 20Gbps,THz main channel,linear codes,auxiliary channel,THz system,maritime THz communication system,"

Considering the shortage of communication resources, the USV shares the same frequency spectrum with the satellite network.

"on small satellites for oceanography: a survey","2016","The recent explosive growth of small satellite operations driven primarily from an academic or pedagogical need, has demonstrated the viability of commercial-off-the-shelf technologies in space. They have also leveraged and shown the need for development of compatible sensors primarily aimed for Earth observation tasks including monitoring terrestrial domains, communications and engineering tests. However, one domain that these platforms have not yet made substantial inroads into, is in the ocean sciences. Remote sensing has long been within the repertoire of tools for oceanographers to study dynamic large scale physical phenomena, such as gyres and fronts, bio-geochemical process transport, primary productivity and process studies in the coastal ocean. We argue that the time has come for micro and nano-satellites (with mass smaller than 100kg and 2–3 year development times) designed, built, tested and flown by academic departments, for coordinated observations with robotic assets in situ. We do so primarily by surveying SmallSat missions oriented towards ocean observations in the recent past, and in doing so, we update the current knowledge about what is feasible in the rapidly evolving field of platforms and sensors for this domain. We conclude by proposing a set of candidate ocean observing missions with an emphasis on radar-based observations, with a focus on Synthetic Aperture Radar.","Ocean observation,Sensors,Small satellites,"

"deep reinforcement learning based latency minimization for mobile edge computing with virtualization in maritime uav communication network","2022","The rapid development of maritime activities has led to the emergence of more and more computation-intensive applications. In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using these two proposed algorithms, we can minimize the system latency.

Coherent distributed arrays, where the individual wireless systems synchronize at the level of the RF carrier phase, achieve transmit power gains on the order of the number of platforms squared, and receive gains proportional to the number of platforms. For radar applications, an array with N elements yields an overall system gain of N3 in the far field of the array, providing a significant improvement in radar sensitivity.

"kalman filter based precoding approach for inter-beam interference cancellation in maritime mtc satellite","2021","The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite for the maritime Machine Type Communication (MTC) is usually equipped with a multi-beam antenna and uses full frequency multiplexing which can increase communication capacity. However, it brings serious inter-beam interference. In this regard, precoding technique is considered to eliminate inter-beam interference. However, conventional precoding algorithms represented by direct inversion bring higher complexity. To this end, we combine the system signal model with the Kalman filter equation and propose a precoding scheme without training sequence in the form of Kalman filter. This scheme can obtain an approximated matrix of the channel inverse matrix. Firstly, we define the channel matrix as the measurement parameter and the precoding matrix as the Kalman state. Then, the difference between the received signal and the transmitted signal is defined as the difference of the Kalman equation as a control factor combined with the Kalman gain. Finally, minimizing control factor through a finite number of iterations to generate the optimum precoding matrix. The numerical results show that the Kalman-based precoding algorithm is more suitable for MTC satellite inter-beam interference cancellation which can gain an improvement in Symbol Error Rate (SER) and system sum rate.","Satellites,symbol error rate,Kalman-based precoding algorithm,MIMO-satellite,maritime MTC satellite,Kalman filters,Kalman gain,direct inversion,matrix algebra,maritime machine type communication,optimum precoding matrix,kalman filter,approximated matrix,precoding scheme,precoding algorithm,Low Earth Orbit satellite,inter-beam interference elimination,interference suppression,channel inverse matrix,iteration finite number,Filtering algorithms,satellite communication,Kalman filter equation,multibeam antenna,precoding,MTC satellite inter-beam interference cancellation,error statistics,Low earth orbit satellites,transmitted signal,Maritime MTC,received signal,SER,precoding approach,frequency multiplexing,control factor,Interference cancellation,inter-beam interference cancellation,system signal model,Training,RSSI,marine communication,Simulation,measurement parameter,communication capacity,MTC satellite,Precoding,Kalman equation,Kalman state,multibeam antennas,"
"digital modular radio (dmr) as a maritime/fixed joint tactical radio system (jtrs)","2001","The definition for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) compliance is continuing to evolve through refinement of the JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO) software communications architecture (SCA). Over the last 3 years, the Navy digital modular radio (DMR) program has solicited, evaluated, and selected a software defined radio, which must eventually evolve to be JTRS compliant. The need to replace legacy communications systems required the Navy to bear the risk that the system they selected would support an orderly migration to JTRS compliance. To reduce the risk, the Navy conducted open system architecture (OSA) evaluations during the selection process. These evaluations looked for specific architecture attributes that would enable a future transition to JTRS compliance. Program participation by the Navy's DMR contractor, Motorola, on JTRS Step 2B successfully demonstrated that DMR is indeed able to migrate to full JTRS compliance. As part of a JTRS Step 2B effort, Motorola assessed the DMR architecture against the SCA V.1.0 and modified the DMR implementation to develop a nearly JTRS SCA compliant DMR prototype. Evaluation confirms that migration to a JTRS SCA V2.0 complaint architecture is possible due largely to the extensible, open DMR architecture that is based on a distributed object computing software architecture.

"event processing in supply chain management – the status quo and research outlook","2019","Increasing supply chain complexity poses new challenges to managers. On the other hand, evolving information and communication technology offers ample opportunity for more reliable supply chain management practices. Event processing has established itself in many applications in logistics. Although the topic has enjoyed increasing popularity, there is no study taking stock of prior developments and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic literature review on the topic of event processing in supply chain management from 2005 until the present is undertaken. Extant literature is synthesized and analyzed from technological and supply chain management perspectives to inform scholars and practitioners of existing field developments. Additionally, to guide future scholarly endeavors, a research agenda is derived from promising topics raised in papers and unfulfilled practical requirements. We find that current solutions primarily focus on a limited number of supply chain core processes and a restricted number of supply chain actors. The majority of publications focused on time-temperature sensitive products. Additionally, the domination of road transportation can be observed, while other modes of transport are often ignored in solution implementations. Decision support in terms of object traceability within the supply chain is found in most articles. RFID, typically accompanied by the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, is the dominant enabling technology. Future research should focus on the topics of standardization, granularity, data sources, and cooperation. Moreover, holistic event processing supported by big data and machine learning techniques could create interfaces with other legacy business intelligence applications. Another promising area includes the exploration of new technologies, i.e. IoT, to enable new smart solutions.","Event processing,Logistics,Decision support,Research agenda,Supply chain event management,Literature review,"

"resource management of maritime edge nodes for collected data feedback","2020","With the development of marine economy, more marine applications emerge leading to more deployed sensors and more generated data. However, current marine Internet only provides low transmission rate constrained by limited communication resources and bad transmission environment. How to efficiently use these resources and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) of applications need to be addressed. This paper proposes an online optimization resource management algorithm to improve the communication resource efficiency with guaranteed QoSs for different applications. This algorithm needs neither of the resource cost function nor QoS constraint function at the resource scheduling node. Furthermore, the gradient information, which is usually needed in learning strategies, is not required either. Instead, this algorithm performs resource management of both computation and communication resources in each time slot only based on the observation of the last time slot. With slot-by-slot resource allocation, the communication cost can be minimized to be suitable for maritime scenarios. In the meantime, a long-term delay constraint can be satisfied. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the goal of reducing communication cost while guaranteeing the delay-constraint of different applications. Although more computation resources will improve its performance, this algorithm still can obtain the minimized cost given a low computation resource.","Image edge detection,marine applications,guaranteed QoSs,long-term delay constraint,quality of service,Delays,time slot,online optimization resource management algorithm,Resource management,gradient information,telecommunication scheduling,resource scheduling node,communication cost minimization,Online resource management,resource cost function,Quality of service,learning strategies,data feedback,optimisation,communication resources,computation resources,low computation resource,communication resource efficiency,edge computing,marine economy,maritime edge nodes,collected data feedback,Bandwidth,quality-of-service,communication cost reduction,current marine Internet,low transmission rate,marine communication,Scheduling,slot-by-slot resource allocation,Internet,resource allocation,maritime communications,QoS constraint function,bad transmission environment,"
"secure task offloading and resource scheduling in maritime edge computing systems","2023","Mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme can enable maritime Internet of things (MIoT) to support computing-intensive and delay-sensitive maritime applications.

The task offloading and resource scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the objective is to maximize the overall performance of the system with the consideration of the physical layer security (PLS). An offloading decision is made based on the channel qualities between USVs and UAV, task queue status and task information of USVs.

"cost- and delay-efficient backhaul selection for time-sensitive maritime communications","2023","Extending the existing near-shore terrestrial infrastructure with non-terrestrial network capabilities helps maritime operators alleviate the high costs of communication and meet the requirements imposed by time-sensitive applications. Recognizing that the deployment of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks necessitates selecting from the available wireless backhaul solutions, which have dissimilar data transmission costs and communication link qualities, it is essential to propose an appropriate backhaul selection policy. Specifically, in this letter, we coin a backhaul selection policy that manages the inherent trade-off between data transmission expenses and timely throughput guarantees for maritime communications. We formulate the backhaul selection problem as a Markov decision process and show that the proposed solution is not only more cost-efficient, but also satisfies the timely throughput requirements in contrast to the currently used greedy strategies.","Satellites,Markov processes,Data communication,near-shore communications,non-terrestrial networks,delay-efficient backhaul selection,maritime operators,near-shore terrestrial infrastructure,time-sensitive maritime communications,Costs,Throughput,cost efficiency,Wireless communication,data transmission costs,backhaul selection policy,timely throughput,time-sensitive applications,Low earth orbit satellites,communication link qualities,nonterrestrial network capabilities,wireless backhaul solutions,decision theory,backhaul selection problem,marine communication,greedy strategies,Backhaul selection,cost-efficient backhaul selection,data transmission expenses,Markov decision process,Backhaul networks,existing near-shore terrestrial infrastructure,"

"nowhere to hide? passive, non-cooperative maritime surveillance from a nanosat","2018","Non-cooperative tracking of shipping from space has traditionally been the preserve of state actors. Recent progress in nanosat and SDR technology raises the possibility of conducting such surveillance from low-cost space platforms. While ships may switch off beacons in order to obscure their location, they cannot proceed safely without their navigation radar systems being operational. Radar emissions may be recorded to achieve geolocation. As the radar antenna is mechanically rotated, a periodic power peak is observed by a fixed receiver. A receiver in LEO will record differing interception times according to its motion and that of the emitter platform. A least squares estimator is used to compare possible emitter locations with the collected data in order to arrive at the most probable geolocation. The highly constrained geometry of the system reduces the search to a 1-dimensional one which significantly reduces the processing power required for a fast answer. It is suggested that power reduction resulting from a new algorithm, coupled with advances in nanosat and SDR technology enables a low-cost demonstrator mission. Additionally, using only one satellite removes the requirement for high-speed data links, further reducing weight and power needs. Accuracies of better than 20km have been recorded in simulations.","Satellites,surveillance,least square estimator,marine radar,nanosat,Radar antennas,Marine vehicles,radar antennas,low-cost demonstrator mission,LEO,high-speed data links,power reduction,satellite communication,ships,maritime surveillance,Frequency measurement,emitter locations,radar antenna,noncooperative tracking,least squares approximations,SDR technology,software radio,Geology,radar emissions,low-cost space platforms,Spaceborne radar,radionavigation,"

"reliable and efficient communications in sensor networks","2007","Wireless sensor networks are inherently plagued by problems of node failure, interference to communications from environmental noise and energy-limited sensor motes. These problems pose conflicting issues in the design of suitable routing protocols. Several existing reliable routing protocols exploit message broadcast redundancy and hop count as routing metrics and their performance trade-offs are revealed during simulation. In this paper, we study and analyse related design issues in proposed efficient and reliable routing protocols that attempt to achieve reliable and efficient communication performance in both single- and multi-hub sensor networks. Simulation results of four such routing protocols show that routing performance depends more on optimal (near-optimal) routing in single hub than in multi-hub networks. Our work also shows that optimal (near-optimal) routing is better achieved when historical metrics like packet distance traversed and transmission success are also considered in the routing protocol design.","Multi-hub network,Single hub network,Deadlock-freedom,Reliable and efficient routing,Wireless sensor network,Routing protocol design,Livelock-freedom,"

"detecting and hunting cyberthreats in a maritime environment: specification and experimentation of a maritime cybersecurity operations centre","2018","The vast majority of worldwide goods exchanges are made by sea. In some parts of the world, the concurrence for dominance at sea is very high and definitely seen as a main military goal. Meanwhile, new generation ships highly rely on information systems for communication, navigation and platform management. This ever-spreading attack surface and permanent satellite links have grown a concern about the potential impact of cyberattacks on a ship at sea or on naval shore infrastructures. Therefore, on top of the usual cyberprotection measures taken for safety reasons, it is essential to implement an ongoing cyber monitoring of ships in order to detect, react accordingly, and stop any incoming threat. In this paper, we explain the specific constraints when trying to assess the cyber situation awareness of maritime information systems. As we will demonstrate, those systems combine physical and logical constraints which complexify their cyber monitoring process and architecture. Gathering valuable data while having a limited and controlled impact on the satellite bandwidth, maintaining a high level of integrity on remote systems in production are, for instance, thriving challenges for both civilian and military ships.

This network uses an antenna system made up of six fixed-beamwidth antennas. Directional antennas are used for both transmission and reception as compared to most other directional antenna schemes which use directional antenna for transmission and omni-directional antenna for reception. Through efficient use of directional antennas for both transmission and reception, and spatial reuse in transmission, we are able to realize a high capacity mesh network.

A communication system tailored to provide a reliable and real time updated map of positions and health conditions of floating people can improve efficiency of rescue operation. The aim of the SMARTSOS system is to introduce the capability for each person, equipped with GPS receiver and health sensors, to send information at low cost to a remote location, maximizing delivery probability and quality of service, ensuring also data integrity.

"desyco: a decision support system for the regional risk assessment of climate change impacts in coastal zones","2016","Several decision support systems were developed in recent years to encourage climate adaptation planning in coastal areas, especially at a national to global scale. However, few prototypes are easy to use and accessible for decision-makers to evaluate and manage risks locally. DESYCO is a GIS based decision support system specifically designed to better understand the risks that climate change poses at the regional/subnational scale (e.g. the effect of sea level rise and coastal erosion on human assets and ecosystems) and set the context of strategic adaptation planning within Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It implements a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowing the spatial assessment of multiple climate change impacts in coastal areas and the ranking of key elements at risk (beaches, wetlands, protected areas, urban and agricultural areas). The core of the system is a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model used to operationalize the steps of the RRA (hazard, exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage assessment) by integrating a blend of information from climate scenarios (global/regional climate projections and hydrodynamic/hydrological simulations) and from non-climate vulnerability factors (physical, environmental and socio-economic features of the analysed system). User-friendly interfaces simplify the interaction with the system, providing guidance for risk mapping, results communication and understanding. DESYCO was applied to low-lying coastal plains and islands (the North Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Gabes and the Republic of Mauritius), river basins and groundwater systems (Upper Plain of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche Region). The paper presents the RRA methodology, the structure of DESYCO and its software architecture, showing the capabilities of the tool to support decision making and climate proofing in a wide range of situations (e.g. shoreline planning, land use and water resource management, flood risk reduction).","Geographic information systems (GIS),Climate change adaptation,Decision support systems (DSS),Risk assessment,Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA),"

"3-d multiobjective deployment of an industrial wireless sensor network for maritime applications utilizing a distributed parallel algorithm","2018","Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications.

"intra-ship channel characterization for smart maritime empowered by 5g","2022","The vision of smart maritime requires a seamless high-data rate wireless connectivity, which can be realized by the fifth-generation communication system (5G). As one of the most widely used 5G frequency spectrum, 3.5 GHz is a promising candidate band to provide high-quality wireless coverage inside ships. Hence, in this paper, the wireless channel in the intra-ship scenario at 3.5 GHz is characterized through extensive ray-tracing (RT) simulations. Channel parameters are extracted and analysed in terms of root-mean-square delay spread (RMS DS), Rician $K$-factor (KF), azimuth/elevation angular spread of arrival/departure (ASA, ASD, ESA, ESD), cross-polarization ratio (XPR), and their cross-correlations.

"beam scheduling of maritime multifunctional radar based on binary integration","2023","This study developed a radar resource management (RRM) framework for maritime multifunctional radar (MFR) that performs surveillance and tracking of unknown targets. The proposed scheme consists of two stages: target prioritization based on fuzzy logic and a beam scheduling approach that transmits surveillance beam and tracking beams for each target appropriately. The proposed beam scheduling scheme also takes into account the imperfect detection of targets in real situation. A conventional heuristic beam scheduling approach was modified to incorporate binary integration in radar theory into the RRM strategy. The resulting scheme efficiently handles the complicated beam scheduling problem by considering the target priority as well as the imperfect detection of targets of a real maritime MFR. Simulation results based on a realistic maritime environment demonstrated that the proposed scheme not only determines the correct order of transmission beams according to the target priority but also maintains good tracking accuracy for the threatening target.","marine radar,Radar resource management,radar detection,tracking accuracy,heuristic beam scheduling approach,Neural networks,maritime MFR,radar resource management framework,fuzzy logic,telecommunication scheduling,RRM strategy,target tracking,beam scheduling,tracking beams,Target tracking,threatening target,object detection,search radar,Radar tracking,complicated beam scheduling problem,multifunctional radar,surveillance beam,Radar,RRM framework,radar tracking,target prioritization,realistic maritime environment,Surveillance,Task analysis,maritime multifunctional radar,binary integration,Radar detection,radar theory,"

"a systematic literature review on rams analysis for critical infrastructures protection","2021","Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety/Security (RAMS) analysis of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) can be applied to investigate their performance subjected to failure modes. The literature has witnessed earlier research approaches to RAM analysis. However, the integration of cybersecurity or safety aspects, along with the RAM to develop RAMS analysis methods, tools, and models, is a significant aspect for protecting CIs as their digitalization is progressing. In recent times, digital components and systems comprising information and communication technologies, smart devices, efficient gateways, faster protocols have transformed the CIs. This transformation comes with a considerable cost, such as the necessity to integrate innovative cyber-defense measures and policies due to new vulnerabilities, efficient maintenance strategies, risk management scenario development, resilience with self-healing architecture. Nevertheless, the current knowledge body lacks an up-to-date Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focused on addressing integrated protection aspects, recent developments, and evaluation criteria towards RAMS analysis for CIs. Accordingly, this study aims to provide a comprehensive SLR on existing studies dealing with developing techniques, methodologies, protocols, models, and RAMS analysis tools for different applications. This SLR followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. 1513 records published between 2011 and 2020 are initially identified, which are later screened to 212 records to be considered for the eligibility check process. Finally, after examining the exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 19 articles are included in this research. In this SLR, a comparative analysis of existing solutions based on included studies is presented in different aspects such as developed architectures and methodologies, performance evaluation mechanisms, implementation scenarios, targeted applications, pros and cons, and applied CIs protection aspects associated with RAMS. The findings suggest that RAMS analysis for CIs is an emerging research area, with currently focused applications including power grid stations, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud computing, maritime transportation, and Industrial Control Systems. 36.8% of the studies have performed a real-time implementation, while the remaining approaches have either performed simulation or preliminary analysis. Also, 84.2% of the included studies focus on integrating only three aspects of CIs protection. Finally, the open research challenges and limitations of existing studies and their respective emerging solutions are presented.","Protection,Critical infrastructures,RAMS,Literature review,"
"an efficient identity-based aggregate signcryption scheme with blockchain for iot-enabled maritime transportation system","2022","Maritime transportation has ushered in a period of vigorous development and has been the most critical mode of transport in international trade. Maritime communication is also becoming increasingly complex. This trend needs the IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation System (IMTS) to enhance its ability of privacy-preserving, performance continuously, and add the function of joint management. Although many aggregate signcryption (ASC) schemes have been presented to satisfy this requirement, they still suffer from performance deficiencies or security weaknesses. To address these issues, we design a more practical â€œPerception-Network-Applicationâ€ IoT-enabled MTS (PNA-IMTS) network structure. Then, we propose an efficient Identity-based aggregate signcryption scheme with blockchain (B-ID-ASC) for PNA-IMTS based on this network model. The security analysis shows that the B-ID-ASC scheme is capable of providing confidentiality and unforgeability. It also can resist existing known attacks (impersonation attack, modification attack, man-in-the-middle attack).

The locations covered in this paper are RÃ¸st (67.5Â°N), VadsÃ¸ (70.1Â°N) and Isfjord Radio (78.1Â°N). The elevation angles towards the satellite are 14, 10 and 3 degrees, respectively. Excess attenuation and precipitation are studied and compared with prediction models from ITU-R. The measured rain intensities at 0.01 per cent of time are 5.8 mm/h for Isfjord Radio, 13.8 mm/h for VadsÃ¸ and 16.5 mm for RÃ¸st. For the three stations, the predicted rain intensities from ITU-R, at the same time percentage, are significantly higher, while the values from the Norwegian mainland rain intensity map are relatively close to the measured ones. Rain height based on measured ground temperatures are lower than those utilised in the ITU-R model for VadsÃ¸ and Isfjord Radio. The significance of cloud attenuation is clearly visible when investigating the same two sites, which both have long paths through the atmosphere.

"a methodology to improve the assessment of vulnerability on the maritime supply chain of energy","2015","The globalization of trade is due to the transportation possibilities and the standardization (containerization of freight). The dependency of the economy to the sea and to the merchant navy has increase this last decade. This process forms a worldwide maritime network between the different locations of production and consumption. This network, representing between 80 % and 90% of world traffic is a major economic concern, including freight distribution, raw materials or energy. Rodrigue demonstrates[1] the economic dependency of energy is increasing in the industrialized countries (North America, Europe, East Asia). The inter-regional trade of oil was 31 million bbl/day in 2002 and is expected to grow up to 57 bbl/day in 2030 [2]. Most of the international traffic use a maritime way, where may occur disruptions. For example, the Suez crisis (1956-1957) caused a closure of the canal, reducing the throughput capacity of transportation. This disruption cost a 2 millions of barrels lost per day.

"wave propagation simulations for considering the installation of the maritime mobile satellite communication antennas","2012","In maritime mobile satellite communications, received satellite signal level varies due to direction and motion of a ship. Then sometimes the communications are interrupted, because the receiving satellite signal level decreases when the ship's body shadows the antenna. Thus it is important to evaluate how qualities of satellite communications vary during ship operations. However, precise temporal level fluctuations during ship movement are not yet studied. In this paper, to evaluate temporal variances of receiving satellite signal level of the ship in motion, modeling and numerical simulations were performed with considering the effect that the ship's body shadows the antennas. Effects of pitching, rolling and yawing were taken into accounting the calculations.

"spatial-modulated physical-layer network coding based on block markov superposition transmission for maritime relay communications","2020","As an alternative to satellite communications, multi-hop relay networks can be deployed for maritime long-distance communications. Distinct from terrestrial environment, marine radio signals are affected by many factors, e.g., weather conditions, evaporation ducting, and ship rocking caused by waves. To ensure the data transmission reliability, the block Markov superposition transmission (BMST) codes, which are easily configurable and have predictable performance, are applied in this study. Meanwhile, the physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme with spatial modulation (SM) is adopted to improve the spectrum utilization.

"seaport data space for improving logistic maritime operations","2020","The maritime industry expects several improvements to efficiently manage the operation processes by introducing Industry 4.0 enabling technologies. Seaports are the most critical point in the maritime logistics chain because of its multimodal and complex nature. Consequently, coordinated communication among any seaport stakeholders is vital to improving their operations. Currently, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Port Community Systems (PCS), as primary enablers of digital seaports, have demonstrated their limitations to interchange information on time, accurately, efficiently, and securely, causing high operation costs, low resource management, and low performance. For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities. The KPIs have been shown in a dashboard to allow easy interpretability of results for planning vessel operations.

The algorithm utilizes the calculation results of adjacent agents to train local model, which can alleviate the coupling between individual agent and global data. For large network with small-scale topological changes, we leverage online learning mechanism for local training to ensure the accuracy of routing decision.

"energy-efficient trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2022","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAVâ€™s energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAVâ€™s flight trajectory subject to wind effect. The conventional successive convex approximation (SCA) method can provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered wind effect, while the computational/trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework with tailored initialization algorithm that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently, as well as a hybrid offline-online (HO2) design that leverages convex stochastic programming (CSP) offline based on wind statistics, and refines the solution by adapting online to real-time wind velocity. Numerical results show that our optimized trajectory can better adapt to various setups with different target data volume and buoysâ€™ topology as well as various wind speed/direction/variance compared with benchmark schemes. In particular, our proposed HO2 design can effectively adapt to random wind variations with feasible and robust online operation, and proactively exploit the wind for further energy savings in both single-buoy and multi-buoy scenarios.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind statistics,wind effect,aircraft power systems,successive convex approximation,Energy consumption,SCA,convex programming,energy-efficient trajectory design,control engineering computing,hybrid offline-online design,trajectory complexity,Wireless communication,flight trajectory,data acquisition,single-buoy scenarios,real-time wind velocity,target data volume,communication time scheduling,oceanic exploration,UAV-aided maritime data collection system,Maritime data collection,HO2 design,random wind variations,hybrid offline-online (HO2),trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,wind direction,energy savings,marine buoys,convex stochastic programming,Real-time systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,wind speed,wind,trajectory control,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,mobile robots,energy conservation,sub-optimal solutions,stochastic programming (SP),aerospace computing,Task analysis,multibuoy scenarios,Data collection,approximation theory,stochastic programming,fixed-wing UAV,CSP,"

"an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station by a ray-based monte carlo method","2017","In this paper, an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station using a ray-based Monte Carlo method has been proposed. A sea surface is modeled by the one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. A Monte Carlo method based on a ray tracing is employed to predict the scattering from the temporally evolving rough sea surface for each time step. The maximum of double reflections is restricted in the ray tracing for a practical purpose. The total received signal is the superposition of the direct propagating field and the scattered field by the sea surface. The statistical numerical result is finally obtained by averaging the results from many realizations. Numerical results for the link performance evaluation obtained by the proposed method are illustrated. The results show that the misalignment of transmitting and receiving antennas due to the rolling ship has relatively less impact on the communication link performance than the multipath fading due to the scattering by the temporally evolving rough sea surface.","direct propagating field,Monte Carlo methods,ray tracing,receiving antennas,scattered field,electromagnetic wave propagation,Marine vehicles,Rough surfaces,Transmitting antennas,Scattering,ships,ransmitting antennas,rough sea surface,one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum,Sea surface,Monte Carlo method,transmitting antennas,statistical numerical result,Receiving antennas,communication link performance,Surface roughness,marine communication,shore station,electromagnetic wave scattering,maritime communications,"

"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning.

Unfortunately, these needs are still far from being adequately fulfilled by currently available technologies. This paper presents some results of our studies aiming at developing broadband radio links operating in UHF/microwave bands at sea. The general principle of the concept that we are implementing is establishment of a robust backbone network based on vessel-to-vessel mesh communications, making use of radio links that are expected to be capable of beyond the horizon operation.

"energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks for mec-enabled maritime internet of things","2022","In recent years, various maritime applications such as unmanned surface vehicles, marine environment monitoring, target tracking, and emergency response have developed rapidly in maritime communication networks (MCNs), and these applications are often accompanied by complex computation tasks and low latency requirements. However, due to the limited resources of the vessels, it is critical to design an efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled network for maritime computation. Inspired by this motivation, energy harvesting space-air-sea integrated networks (EH-SASINs) for maritime computation tasks offloading are proposed in this paper. We first make the optimal deployment of tethered aerostats (TAs) with the K-means method. In addition, we study the issue of computation task offloading for vessels, focusing on minimizing the process delay of computation task based on the proposed architecture. Finally, because of the NP-hard properties of the optimization problem, we solve it in two stages and propose an improved water-filling algorithm based on queuing theory.

According to the e-navigation concept, the various marine and marine-related domains' data both on- and off-shore are used as resources for maritime services, the purpose of which are to facilitate communication at sea and to ensure safe navigation. To those ends, e-navigation services exchange, share, and utilize data resources created and distributed according to the data product specifications based on the e-navigation Common Maritime Data Structure (CMDS). Currently, maritime equipment and systems transfer data among themselves over ships' networks. In e-navigation, those equipment and systems' data will be utilized as useful data resources. But before that data can be used, it is necessary to create and distribute it according to the above-noted CMDS-based data product specifications.

"sea fog attenuation analysis of white-led light sources for maritime vlc","2019","Maritime VLC has features of high speed, low cost and anti-EMI. The scattering attenuation of sea fog particles for white-LED light source will directly affect the signal transmission. Due to meteorological effects, much physical detail could be lost in Maritime VLC. Effects of changes in the particle size distributions and influences of different sources cannot easily be taken into account. To address this issue, this paper presents scattering spectrum analysis of sea fog particles and attenuation of maritime VLC channel systematically. Firstly, based on sea fog parameters, the scattering, extinction and phase functions of sea fog particles can be calculated by employing Mie theory. Furthermore, scattering analysis of sea fog particle swarm could be evaluated. Then transmission attenuation of wide spectrum white-LED is analyzed by utilizing revised Gamma distribution.

"energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2020","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAVaided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV's energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory subject to wind effect, which is a non-convex problem and difficult to solve optimally. Existing techniques such as the successive convex approximation (SCA) method provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on the trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered the wind effect, while the computational complexity and resulted trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently subject to wind effect. Specifically, the proposed UAV trajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible for collecting only a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the computational/trajectory complexity, which allows searching for better trajectory initialization that fits the buoys' topology and the wind. Numerical results show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the benchmark oneflight-only scheme in general. Moreover, the optimized cyclical 8-shape trajectory can proactively exploit the wind and achieve lower energy consumption compared with the case without wind.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind effect,energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design,convex approximation,Energy consumption,convex programming,Acceleration,scheduling,nonconvex problem,communication time scheduling,UAV trajectory,oceanic exploration,8-shape trajectory,Maritime data collection,data volume,trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,strong winds,UAV energy consumption,marine buoys,UAV-aided maritime data collection,autonomous aerial vehicles,nonlinear programming,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,multiple cyclical laps,sub-optimal solutions,Task analysis,UAV flight trajectory subject,Data collection,approximation theory,fixed-wing UAV,energy efficiency,"

"a stochastic ray-tracing approach for maritime line-of-sight channel modeling","2019","In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for maritime wireless channels based on a stochastic ray-tracing approach. Taking into consideration the line-of-sight (LOS) path, the specular reflection path, and the diffuse reflection paths from the sea surface, the maritime wireless fading channel is modeled by combining all the propagation paths arrived at the receiver point. In contrast to the conventional ray-tracing approaches where the propagation environments (and hence, the rays) are considered to be fixed, our stochastic ray-tracing approach assumes varying propagation environment caused by practical factors such as the sea wave. In this case, the locations of the reflection and receiver points randomly vary following a stochastic process. Based on the proposed channel model, we further investigate the deep fading effect in maritime wireless propagations caused by destructive combination of sparse rays. We show by simulations that the role of sea wave has two sides. Specifically, the sea wave is beneficial to compensate the deep fading in the areas where the LOS path and the specular reflection path have been destructively combined, while on the other hand it might induce more outage in the areas where deep fading has not occurred.","ray tracing,receiver points,ray-tracing,sparse rays,maritime wireless channel,Rough surfaces,Stochastic processes,channel model,maritime wireless channels,propagation paths,maritime line-of-sight channel,outage,line-of-sight path,stochastic processes,radiowave propagation,Reflection,diffuse reflection paths,specular reflection path,Sea surface,line-of-sight,Fading channels,LOS path,fading channel,sea wave,Surface roughness,marine communication,Channel model,propagation environment,conventional ray-tracing approaches,stochastic ray-tracing approach,Ray tracing,fading channels,"

"maritime vehicle tracking using underwater gliders and particle filters","2016","A major difficulty in tracking unidentified vessels at sea is due to the need to observe large areas for long periods of time for sparsely appearing targets. A possible solution is to use a network of energy efficient underwater gliders that use buoyancy engines and are equipped with sensor array, processing, and communication hardware. Gliders, however, have a limited size and payload which limits the length of their sensor array and the capabilities of their power, processing, and communication modules. This reduces the resolution of measurements that can be collected and processed on board of gliders and be communicated to a fusion center for accurate target tracking. In this work, we propose the use of adaptive compressive sensing and processing to enable accurate target tracking while using low signal acquisition, processing, and communication rates, short sensor array lengths, and simplified sensing and processing hardware hosted on gliders.

The proposed methodology adopts a decentralised approach towards the allocation of perception and control processes to different agents (unmanned vessels, fog or cloud services) based on an estimation of the communication parameters (bandwidth, latency, cost), the agent capabilities in terms of processing hardware (not only focusing on the CPU, but also taking into consideration the GPU, disk & memory speed and size) and the requirements in terms of timely delivery of quality output data.

"hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial networks for 6g ubiquitous coverage: a maritime communications perspective","2021","In the coming smart ocean era, reliable and efficient communications are crucial for promoting a variety of maritime activities. Current maritime communication networks (MCNs) mainly rely on marine satellites and on-shore base stations (BSs). The former generally provides limited transmission rate, while the latter lacks wide-area coverage capability. Due to these facts, the state-of-the-art MCN falls far behind terrestrial fifth-generation (5G) networks. To fill up the gap in the coming sixth-generation (6G) era, we explore the benefit of deployable BSs for maritime coverage enhancement. Both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile vessels are used to configure deployable BSs. This leads to a hierarchical satellite-UAV-terrestrial network on the ocean. We address the joint link scheduling and rate adaptation problem for this hybrid network, to minimize the total energy consumption with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Different from previous studies, we use only the large-scale channel state information (CSI), which is location-dependent and thus can be predicted through the position information of each UAV/vessel based on its specific trajectory/shipping lane. The problem is shown to be an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with a group of hidden non-linear equality constraints. We solve it suboptimally by using Min-Max transformation and iterative problem relaxation, leading to a process-oriented joint link scheduling and rate adaptation scheme. As observed by simulations, the scheme can provide agile on-demand coverage for all users with much reduced system overhead and a polynomial computation complexity. Moreover, it can achieve a prominent performance close to the optimal solution.","Satellites,unmanned aerial vehicles,fifth-generation networks,maritime communications perspective,NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem,polynomial computation complexity,nonlinear equality constraints,on-shore base stations,quality of service,optimal control,wide-area coverage capability,current maritime communication networks,maritime coverage enhancement,integer programming,Resource management,MCN,link scheduling,iterative problem relaxation,scheduling,agile on-demand coverage,trajectory-shipping lane,Channel state information (CSI),reliable communications,process-oriented joint link scheduling,large-scale channel state information,Quality of service,Maritime communications,marine satellites,rate adaptation,sixth-generation era,efficient communications,hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks,rate adaptation problem,6G mobile communication,radio networks,software prototyping,wireless channels,smart ocean era,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,deployable BSs,6G ubiquitous coverage,Optimization,nonlinear programming,min-max transformation,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,energy consumption,trajectory control,computational complexity,marine communication,optimal solution,mobile vessels,transmission rate,maritime communications,unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),hybrid network,"
"a generic and modular architecture for maritime autonomous vehicles","2018","Autonomous systems face the challenge of managing disruptive events such as internal alterations, mission updates and environmental perturbations that always occur in an operational context. Autonomous vehicles must embed the capabilities to supervise their behaviour and to detect and react to such events.

"aqua safe: blockchain based maritime communication system using ad hoc network","2022","The lack of a pre-existing infrastructure for facilitating long-range connectivity with the land makes maritime communications extremely difficult. Satellite connections, which are expensive, and use much power, are generally used to communicate on the high seas. For better connectivity between fisheries and land stations, different functional methods such as whether detection, boundary detection, data security, barrier detection, and data communication without interruption have been implemented in the system. Implementing a LoRa WAN system is to inform about emergencies in the deep sea and send the information indicated above.

"a deep semantic autoencoder for maritime wireless communications","2023","With the rapid development of maritime transportation, ocean tourism, monitoring, surveillance and aquaculture, the maritime communication industry has encountered new opportunities. Maritime End-to-end (E2E) communication systems based on deep learning (DL) have become diverse, while semantic communication systems have become a critical research point due to their ability to understand and analyze natural language. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic autoencoder (DSA) for maritime wireless communications. The DSA consists of a semantic encoder, channel encoder, channel decoder, and semantic decoder. The DSA employs transformers and convolutional neural networks to extract and restore the meaning of sentences while minimizing semantic errors during transmission. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the DSA in transmitting maritime data, the Rician fading channel is utilized to simulate complex and varied marine environments. Furthermore, the system parameters of the DSA are optimized through training the maritime data and calculating the loss functions. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that compared to the benchmark, the DSA demonstrates superior bilingual evaluation understudy and sentence similarity performance under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions, indicating its ability to effectively extract semantics.","end-to-end,semantic communication systems,Semantics,surveillance,maritime data,Transportation,Benchmark testing,deep learning (artificial intelligence),system parameters,maritime wireless communications,semantic encoder,maritime communication industry,deep semantic autoencoder,natural language processing,semantic errors,Wireless communication,critical research point,deep learning,marine safety,semantics,marine engineering,Maritime wireless communications,Rician channels,maritime transportation,maritime end-to-end communication systems,convolutional neural nets,semantic decoder,Training,ocean tourism,marine communication,Simulation,Surveillance,artificial intelligence,DSA,channel decoder,aquaculture,Rician fading channel,"
"convergence of broadband and broadcast/multicast in maritime information networks","2021","Recently, the fifth-generation (5G) of wireless networks mainly focuses on the terrestrial applications. However, the well-developed emerging technologies in 5G are hardly applied to the maritime communications, resulting from the lack of communication infrastructure deployed on the vast ocean, as well as different characteristics of wireless propagation environment over the sea and maritime user distribution. To satisfy the expected plethora of broadband communications and multimedia applications on the ocean, a brand-new maritime information network with a comprehensive coverage capacity in terms of all-hour, all-weather, and all-sea-area has been expected as a revolutionary paradigm to extend the terrestrial capacity of enhanced broadband, massive access, ultra-reliable, and low-latency to the vast ocean. Further considering the limited available resource of maritime communication infrastructure, the convergence of broadband and broadcast/multicast can be regarded as a possible yet practical solution for realizing an efficient and flexible resource configuration with high quality of services. Moreover, according to such multi-functionality and all-coverage maritime information network, the monitoring and sensing of vast ocean area relying on massive Ocean of Things and advanced radar techniques can be also supported. Concerning these issues above, this study proposes a Software Defined Networking (SDN) based Maritime Giant Cellular Network (MagicNet) architecture for broadband and multimedia services.

"tracking receiver design for the electronic beam squint tracking system in the maritime mobile environment","1988","One method of reducing the overall cost of a shipborne satellite terminal is to dispense with the stabilised platform. This is only permissible in a situation in which the dynamic performance of the tracking system can compensate directly for the motion of the ship. Two techniques have been proposed to solve this problem. The first involves the use of optimal estimation techniques which utilise both the available tracking information and the instantaneous platform orientation to provide steering information for the antenna. This is obviously a complex technique as it requires a separate high-speed microprocessor system to provide information on the ship's dynamics. The second, a new technique, is the 'electronic beam squint' (EBS) tracking system under investigation at Bristol University. This system can be demonstrated to counter the characteristic roll and pitch dynamics of a maritime vessel purely by a closed-loop tracking technique. The authors investigate the beam squint technique from the viewpoint of the tracking receiver in a maritime environment, together with the more general problems experienced by tracking receivers in this situation.<>","steering information,mobile radio systems,closed-loop tracking technique,antenna,Receivers,high-speed microprocessor system,satellite relay systems,Satellite communication,marine systems,maritime mobile environment,tracking systems,electronic beam squint tracking system,Tracking,receivers,optimal estimation techniques,"
"wireless sensor network for localized maritime monitoring","2008","In this paper, we propose a novel routing algorithm for maritime monitoring of short term events where large area monitoring relies on small buoys drifting along with local currents. The objective of this algorithm is to improve communication where scalable mobile networks are optimized by taking into consideration a weight function based on remaining energy and relative distance between buoys. To improve wide area communication, amplified transmitters were selected. Therefore route optimization requires a different approach, as transmission requires more power than reception. We present two new approaches for message routing, where relay selection depends on a weight advertised periodically, and calculated through remaining energy and route distance to sink. The first approach uses a single route, while the second approach balances its load by using different routes selected in proportion to route weight. In both cases, the algorithms show improvements over single-hop and greedy approaches. Moreover, the second solution shows a more efficient message distribution through relay nodes that ultimately results in lower latency.","Satellites,Wireless Sensor Networks,wireless sensor network,Wireless sensor networks,Computerized monitoring,Sea measurements,monitoring,localized maritime monitoring,Petroleum,routing algorithm,Pollution measurement,Synthetic aperture radar,relay nodes,wide area communication,routing,single-hop approach,Remote monitoring,marine engineering,wireless sensor networks,oil slick,Sea surface,large area monitoring,scalable mobile networks,two-hop,load balancing,clustering,Routing,greedy approach,route optimization,mobile communication,message distribution,wide area networks,small buoys,message routing,"

"signal strength sensitivity and its effects on routing in maritime wireless networks","2008","Unlike terrestrial networks, the received signal strength in maritime wireless networks are subjected to perturbations due to the sea movement. Surface motions at sea cause variations in antenna heights and orientations of the communicating node (e.g. ships and buoys), thus affecting the received signal strength. In order to minimize such undesirable effects, we carried out a detailed study of the relationship between sea waves and the received signal strength. The effect of antenna gain variations due to tilting of antenna masts were studied by modeling sea waves. The channel path-loss variations were studied using a two-ray path-loss model for the maritime environment. Our analysis showed that the sea wave movements affect both short and longer links. We proposed a simple scheme to avoid the use of unstable links and implemented it on the QualNet network simulator.

"performance evaluation of manet routing protocols in a maritime environment","2014","DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector), AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector), AOMDV (Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector) and DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) are among the most widely used routing protocols in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) due to their compatibility with multi hop routing environments and scalability towards increased traffic and mobility.

The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds.

On the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services. In this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography schemes.

With delay and energy consumption as constraints, the revenue function for task offloading path is designed. The function comprehensively considers network resources, channel transmission and node execution ability, thereby achieving the reliable task offloading. Simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the success rate of task execution, reduce the network packet loss rate and ensure the network resources load balancing, which effectively improve the QoS of maritime edge computing networks.","telecommunication network reliability,task offloading scheme,task offloading path,network resources load balancing,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Delays,packet loss,task execution,task packet loss,maritime edge computing,telecommunication scheduling,multi-path fading,Manganese,ships,Quality of service,Maritime communications,network packet loss rate,mobile computing,ship motion model,edge computing,network connectivity,task offloading,telecommunication traffic,maritime communication network,Edge computing,node coverage,energy consumption,marine communication,Task analysis,reliable task offloading,resource allocation,maritime edge computing network,"
"uav-assisted data offloading for smart container in offshore maritime communications","2022","Smart containers have been extensively applied in the maritime industry by embracing the Internet of Things to realize container status monitoring and data offloading without human intervention. However, the offloading rate and delay in the offshore region are limited by the coverage of the onshore base station (BS). In this paper, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data offloading for smart containers in offshore maritime communications where the UAV is as a relay node between smart containers and onshore BS. We first consider the mobility of container vessel in the offshore region and establish a UAV-assisted data offloading model. Based on this model, a data offloading algorithm is proposed to reduce the average offloading delay under data-size requirements and available energy constraints of smart containers. Specifically, the convex-concave procedure is used to update time-slot assignment, offloading approach selection, and power allocation in an iterative manner. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce average offloading delay and increase offloading success ratio. Moreover, it is shown that the UAV relay cannot always bring the performance gain on offloading delay especially in the close-to-shore area, which could give an insight on the deployment of UAV relay in offshore communications.","data offloading algorithm,average offloading delay,offshore maritime communications,time-slot assignment update,smart container,offshore communications,container status monitoring,offloading rate,convex programming,Monitoring,Delays,UAV relay,offloading approach selection,data-size requirements,concave programming,Containers,Relays,Maritime communications,unmanned aerial vehicle,data offloading,freight containers,Data models,UAV-assisted data offloading model,offshore region,container vessel,maritime Internet of Things,unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted data offloading,Autonomous aerial vehicles,offloading success ratio,autonomous aerial vehicles,telecommunication traffic,marine communication,"

"environmental contaminants and human health in the canadian arctic","2010","The third Canadian Arctic Human Health Assessment conducted under the Canadian Northern Contaminants Program (NCP), in association with the circumpolar Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), addresses concerns about possible adverse health effects in individuals exposed to environmental contaminants through a diet containing country foods. The objectives here are to: 1) provide data on changes in human contaminant concentrations and exposure among Canadian Arctic peoples; 2) identify new contaminants of concern; 3) discuss possible health effects; 4) outline risk communication about contaminants in country food; and 5) identify knowledge gaps for future contaminant research and monitoring. The nutritional and cultural benefits of country foods are substantial; however, some dietary studies suggest declines in the amount of country foods being consumed. Significant declines were found for most contaminants in maternal blood over the last 10years within all three Arctic regions studied. Inuit continue to have the highest levels of almost all persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals among the ethnic groups studied. A greater proportion of people in the East exceed Health Canada's guidelines for PCBs and mercury, although the proportion of mothers exceeding these guidelines has decreased since the previous assessment. Further monitoring and research are required to assess trends and health effects of emerging contaminants. Infant development studies have shown possible subtle effects of prenatal exposure to heavy metals and some POPs on immune system function and neurodevelopment. New data suggest important beneficial effects on brain development for Inuit infants from some country food nutrients. The most successful risk communication processes balance the risks and benefits of a diet of country food through input from a variety of regional experts and the community, to incorporate the many socio-cultural and economic factors to arrive at a risk management decision that will be the most beneficial in Arctic communities.","Infant,Risk communication,Maternal,Legacy and emerging environmental contaminant monitoring,Metals,Country food,Organochlorines,Arctic health,"

"developing maritime digital competencies","2021","In recent years, there has been a relentless drive by all industries to digitalize many everyday operations. The maritime industry is no exception, with the increase in digital tools that assist the everyday operations of the seafarer. What is more, much of this technology is now networked together, or to the Internet, which opens the seafarer up to a wave of new cyber risks. Maritime communication systems have often been demonstrated as insecure in the recent past. Thus, without appropriate training, seafarers are ill-prepared to protect themselves, and the systems for which they are responsible, from the impacts of cyber incidents. This article argues that there is a clear link between seafarer training and maritime safety. As such, there is a need to develop standardized digital competencies for all seafarers.

"a blockchain-based authentication scheme and secure architecture for iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Although modern Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) have been extensively benefited from Internet of Things (IoT) technology, but still the risks and challenges in safety and reliability have increased substantially. The involvement of different maritime parties in the marine transportation flow scheduling and management further escalates these challenges. Thus, we need an IoT-based collaborative processing system that unifies the modular structure and integrates multiple modules involved in MTS. Moreover, the need for a shared and controlled access mechanism that cannot be manipulated or tampered by unauthorized parties is also essential requirement in MTS. Blockchain, as an emerging technology, has become a key tool in data security protection because of its non-tampering and non-forgery characteristics. Keeping in view of this aspect, in this paper, an IoT-based collaborative processing system based on blockchain is proposed for marine transportation flow scheduling and management.

"an identity-based data integrity auditing scheme for cloud-based maritime transportation systems","2023","With the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), massive data generated in the system not only requires to be stored reliably and cheaply, but also needs to be analyzed timely. The Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems (CMTS) allow users to upload the data without worrying about the price, capacity, location and so on. However, CMTS also brings some security issues, where the integrity protection of outsourced data is one of the most important issues since it is crucial for the safety, reliability and efficiency of sea lanes. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme for CMTS. Our scheme decreases the burden of key management and improves the auditing efficiency by batch auditing. Besides, our scheme also supports dynamic operations on the outsourced data for CMTS. The security analysis shows that our scheme can ensure the feature of storage correctness and resist common attacks. In addition, the performance comparison results with other related schemes show that our scheme not only has the lowest computational cost on all entities, but also greatly reduces the communication overhead of the auditing phase.

"energy-efficient full-duplex uav relaying with trajectory optimization and power control in maritime communication environments","2022","This paper solves an energy-efficient optimization problem of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted full-duplex mobile relaying in maritime communication environments. Taking the speed and the acceleration of the UAV and the information-causality constraints into consideration, the energy-efficiency of the system under investigation is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and the individual transmit power levels of the source and the UAV relay nodes. The optimization problem is non-convex and thus cannot be solved directly. Therefore, it is decoupled into two subproblems. One sub-problem is for the transmit power control at the source and the UAV relay nodes, and the other aims at optimizing the UAV's flight trajectory. By using the Lagrangian dual and Dinkelbach methods, the two sub-problems are solved, leading to an iterative algorithm for the joint design of transmit power control and trajectory optimization. Computer simulations demonstrated that by conducting the proposed algorithm, the flight trajectory of the UAV and the individual transmit power levels of the nodes can be flexibly adjusted according to the system conditions, and the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly higher energy efficiency as compared with the other benchmark schemes.","UAV relay nodes,individual transmit power levels,fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle,energy-efficiency,remotely operated vehicles,Throughput,full-duplex relaying (FDR),information-causality constraints,concave programming,energy-efficient optimization problem,full-duplex mobile relaying,Relays,UAV communication,Maritime communications,optimisation,energy-efficient full-duplex UAV,Power control,Autonomous aerial vehicles,maritime communication,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,power control,trajectory optimization,Trajectory,Energy efficiency,marine communication,maritime communication environments,energy conservation,transmit power control,UAV's flight trajectory,UAV's trajectory,"

"horizon detection from electro-optical sensors under maritime environment","2020","In recent years, target detection in maritime surveillance has become a popular subject. Horizon under maritime environment is one of the most important semantic boundaries for segmenting the image into sea and sky. With the help of horizon, seeking scope can be restricted to a definite small area, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. Meanwhile, horizon is used to automatically adjust the attitude of air vehicles as well. Although a plenty of algorithms for horizon detection have been created, they are prone to low visibility and occlusions. In this paper, a novel robust algorithm based on probability distribution and physical characteristics is proposed. At first, the probabilities are distributed to each vertically divided region by weighted textures, and the sea-sky region is located from definite probabilistic intervals. Based on a Canny edge detector, Hough transform extracts a series of candidate horizons. Finally, a novel voting method is applied. The line with the maximum value will be regarded as the true horizon. The proposed algorithm can not only precisely detect the horizon from fine images but also from blurred image, even with splashed camera. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments on 65 videos containing more than 20 000 frames under different sceneries.

"cache optimization strategy for mobile edge computing in maritime iot","2022","With the increasing storage capacity of Internet of Things (IoT) mobile devices, cache-enabled device-to-device (D2D) networks enable efficient information sharing, thereby increasing the transmission efficiency of the entire network. The efficiency is further improved by the rational deployment of caching strategies on mobile devices in combination with traditional base station transmission methods. In this paper, the mobile-aware caching strategy is divided into two problems to solve. The first problem is to solve the user's latency-minimizing cache placement problem. We transform the problem into a decision problem, propose a low-complexity algorithm that approximates the optimal solution, and justify the method using the properties of submodular functions. The second problem addresses external restriction parameters, such as cache file type, cache upper limit, and deadline. We find through simulation that there is a bottleneck in the performance improvement of the whole system as the external parameters change. A suitable formulation of these parameters can put the system in a range where the input and output are most effective, further maximizing the performance of the optimization method.

"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time.

The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"

"a routing protocol for wimax based maritime wireless mesh networks","2009","We envisage extending radio coverage of the existing terrestrial wireless broadband networks to the sea to provide ships with high speed connection to the Internet. This is achieved by forming a WiMAX-based maritime wireless mesh network where ships are network nodes connected to the land station across multiple hops.

This paper proposes a routing protocol, called MRPT (MAC-based Routing Protocol for TRITON), that piggybacks routing information on WiMAX mesh MAC control messages. This provides proactiveness and readily available multi-path for traffic from ship to land station. For traffic from land station to ship, the proposed routing protocol uses a bitmap encoding to efficiently inform land station of the constructed routing tree.

Wide-swath SAR system based on networking of multiple small satellites for maritime applications is proposed in this paper, where the wide swath can be quickly scanned during one pulse repeated period (PRP) by the high-gain and narrow transmit beam, and all the echoes of the entire coverage can be obtained by the multi-channel receivers with low-gain and wide beam. The high SNR echoes of the different sub-swath can be reconstructed with digital beam forming (DBF) technology along the range direction.

"on apache log4j2 exploitation in aeronautical, maritime, and aerospace communication","2022","Apache Log4j2 is a prevalent logging library for Java-based applications. In December 2021, several critical and high-impact software vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-44228, were publicly disclosed, enabling remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS) attacks. To date, these vulnerabilities are considered critical and the consequences of their disclosure far-reaching. The vulnerabilities potentially affect a wide range of internet of things (IoT) devices, embedded devices, critical infrastructure (CI), and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In this paper, we study the effects and feasibility of exploiting these vulnerabilities in mission-critical aviation and maritime environments using the ACARS, ADS-B, and AIS protocols. We develop a systematic methodology and an experimental setup to study and identify the protocolsâ€™ exploitable fields and associated attack payload features. For our experiments, we employ software-defined radios (SDRs), use open-source software, develop novel tools, and develop features to existing software.

"adaptive network based fuzzy inference system for frequency regulation in modern maritime power systems","2019","It is expected that the wireless technologies will play a large role as communication infrastructures in the next generation of the marine power systems due to some benefits, such as large information reliability, wide coverage area, etc. However, such technologies are exposed to some network degradations such as transmission delays, packet loss and network congestion, which highly threaten the reliability of the networked control system. Thus, the effects of the network degradations should be considered during the controller design procedure since they will lead to system instability. This letter presents the analysis of a wireless network control system based on the Fifth Generation (5G) cellular technology for a navy Shipboard Microgrid (SMG). In this study, a new cascaded combination of interval type-2 fractional order fuzzy and PI/PO (IT2FOF/PI-PO) controller supervised online adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed for the frequency grid oscillation damping in the concerned networked SMG. For a more efficient performance of the suggested structured controller, a modified version of sine cos algorithm (SCA) is proposed for optimal setting of the controller parameters. The comprehensive studies and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations are conducted to assess the behavior of the proposed technique.","transmission delays,control system synthesis,frequency regulation,system instability,packet loss,5G Cellular Network Technology,fuzzy reasoning,navy shipboard microgrid,neurocontrollers,interval type-2 fractional order fuzzy controller,maritime power systems,wireless network control system,power system stability,network congestion,5G mobile communication,hardware-in-the-loop simulations,networked control system,communication infrastructures,optimisation,adaptive control,Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS),adaptive network based fuzzy inference system,frequency grid oscillation,fuzzy set theory,controller parameters,marine power systems,controller design procedure,fifth generation cellular technology,information reliability,Load Frequency Control (LFC),online adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system,supervised online adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system,sine cos algorithm,fuzzy control,network degradations,distributed power generation,"

This paper presents a maritime communication network architecture where the onshore high-tower base station provides wireless backhaul for the shipborne base stations, while the shipborne base stations serve as the mobile access points for the user ships. Under this architecture, considering the out-of-band full-duplex (OBFD) backhauling mode, we propose a joint backhaul and access link resource management scheme in respect to the wireless backhaul power allocation, access link power allocation and user association, for the sake of maximizing the network capacity. Specially, this scheme takes the inter-cell interference and the multiuser association into account in order to model the realistic maritime communication scenarios.

We first introduce two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided maritime communication models. By analyzing the mutual information of joint processing, we derive the closed-form expression of lower bound for the achievable rate. Simulation results indicate that joint processing can take full advantage of the channel state information contained in received data signals, and it gives rise to a satisfying spectral efficiency.

Obviously, reduction of GHG emissions through operational measures can also reduce costs. This has been realized by the shipping community and the e-Navigation (by International Maritime Organization - IMO) and e-Maritime (by European Union - EU) initiatives testify to this.

Currently long-range, high-speed backhaul communication over sea is limited to line-of-sight (LOS) distances requiring high antenna towers for microwave radio link or satellite based backhaul link which is limited in bandwidth. Using evaporation duct, present over Malaysian water in South China Sea surface to our advantage, we can achieve results for a long-range, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) maritime wireless backhaul high-speed communication link. With high reliability and capacity this could be the best alternative for long-range, high-speed maritime communication. Virtual MIMO based Mesh Network can further increase availability and capacity performance for a NLOS broadband maritime wireless communication Network.","MIMO,satellite-based backhaul link,telecommunication network reliability,Malaysian water,LOS distance,transhorizon non-line-of-sight communication,transhorizon NLOS communication,antenna arrays,Ducts,NLOS broadband maritime wireless communication Network,high-speed backhaul communication link,virtual MIMO-based mesh network,Mathematical model,Mesh networks,communication reliability,Wireless communication,Shadow mapping,high-capacity communication,Long-range,Backhaul Network,poles and towers,Evaporation Duct,evaporation duct,transhorizon link-based data communication,antenna towers,Trans-horizon signal propagation,Virtual MIMO,Maritime wireless communication,Radio link,microwave radio link,marine communication,South China Sea surface,maritime wireless communication backhaul network,MIMO communication,Mesh Network,line-of-sight distance,"
"novel maritime channel models for millimeter radiowaves","2016","This work presents and analyzes the results of millimeter-wave propagation simulations performed for over the sea LoS ship to ship communication channels. We present a channel characterization study where channel parameters such as path loss, received power, RMS delay spread, and power delay profile are obtained by using a ray tracing approach. 5G candidate frequencies, 35 GHz and 94 GHz were chosen as the primary bands of interest since these two bands have minimum water and oxygen attenuation, thereby promising better performance among the other frequency bands. Our results indicate that 2-ray analytical propagation loss model should only be used for short ranges over the sea surface propagation at typical frequencies considered by 5G. However, free space path loss model cannot predict the behavior of channel over the sea surface in high frequencies even for short ranges. Therefore, in this study a new model that is the modified version of 2-ray path loss model is proposed, in which a coefficient in the power of exponential function is introduced to better predict the behavior of maritime channels of 5G. It is shown that the proposed model can predict the path loss of maritime channel better than the existing models.","ray tracing,millimeter radiowaves,free space path loss model,Ducts,wireless path loss,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime channel modeling,novel maritime channel models,Predictive models,radiowaves,oxygen attenuation,exponential function,sea surface propagation,millimeter wave propagation simulations,Propagation losses,Sea surface,propagation loss model,sea LoS ship,maritime channels,channel parameters,wireless channels,marine communication,Receivers,ship communication channels,"
"uplink noma for uav-aided maritime internet-of-things","2023","Maritime activities are vital for economic growth, being further accelerated by various emerging maritime Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, including smart ports, autonomous navigation, and ocean monitoring systems. However, broadband, low-delay, and reliable wireless connectivity to the ever-increasing number of vessels, buoys, platforms and sensors in maritime communication networks (MCNs) has not yet been achieved. Towards this end, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in MCNs provides an aerial dimension to current deployments, relying on shore-based base stations (BSs) with limited coverage and satellite links with high latency. In this work, a maritime IoT topology is examined where direct uplink communication with a shore BS cannot be established due to excessive pathloss. In this context, we employ multiple UAVs for end-to-end connectivity, simultaneously receiving data from the maritime IoT nodes, following the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) paradigm. In contrast to other UAV-aided NOMA schemes in maritime settings, dynamic decoding ordering at the UAVs is used to improve the performance of successive interference cancellation (SIC), considering the rate requirements and the channel state information (CSI) of each maritime node towards the UAVs. Moreover, the UAVs are equipped with buffers to store data and provide increased degrees of freedom in opportunistic UAV selection. Simulations reveal that the proposed opportunistic UAV-aided NOMA improves the average sum-rate of NOMAbased maritime IoT communication, leveraging the dynamic decoding ordering and caching capabilities of the UAVs.","Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA),Decoding,telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication power management,unmanned aerial vehicles,uplink NOMA,multiple UAVs,UAV-aided maritime Internet-of-Things,nonorthogonal multiple access,Internet of Things,UAV-aided NOMA schemes,Maritime Internet-of-Things,Wireless sensor networks,Maritime Communication Networks,emerging maritime Internet,Wireless communication,economic growth,direct uplink communication,interference suppression,decoding,reliable wireless connectivity,NOMA,maritime settings,5G mobile communication,Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV),nonorthogonal multiple access paradigm,Opportunistic Selection,cellular radio,opportunistic UAV-aided NOMA,shore-based base stations,Autonomous aerial vehicles,end-to-end connectivity,wireless channels,maritime node,Interference cancellation,autonomous aerial vehicles,smart ports,maritime IoT topology,marine communication,aerial dimension,maritime communication networks,multi-access systems,NOMAbased maritime IoT communication,maritime activities,ocean monitoring systems,opportunistic UAV selection,MCNs,"

"botnet detection based on traffic behavior analysis and flow intervals","2013","Botnets represent one of the most serious cybersecurity threats faced by organizations today. Botnets have been used as the main vector in carrying many cyber crimes reported in the recent news. While a significant amount of research has been accomplished on botnet analysis and detection, several challenges remain unaddressed, such as the ability to design detectors which can cope with new forms of botnets. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect botnet activity based on traffic behavior analysis by classifying network traffic behavior using machine learning. Traffic behavior analysis methods do not depend on the packets payload, which means that they can work with encrypted network communication protocols. Network traffic information can usually be easily retrieved from various network devices without affecting significantly network performance or service availability. We study the feasibility of detecting botnet activity without having seen a complete network flow by classifying behavior based on time intervals. Using existing datasets, we show experimentally that it is possible to identify the presence of existing and unknown botnets activity with high accuracy even with very small time windows.","Intrusion detection,Botnet,Network flows,Traffic behavior analysis,Machine learning,"

E-commerce and e-work is still at its embryonic stages, however, the annual rate of increase suggest that in very few years this share will have grown dramatically. Thus, it is time to get prepared. The aim of the present paper is to present a new maritime intelligent workplace based weather information system and decision support for high-speed maritime transport.

"compensation of antenna misalignment using selection diversity for maritime communications","2018","Communication is essential for coastal and rural areas, and providing an alternative method of communication for isolated coves through maritime communications is a way to cater that need. In order to create a reliable communication system, antenna misalignment attributed to wave motion of the sea must be accounted for because losses in transmission and reception occur. The scope of this study covers the angular variation of wave motion, particularly the roll angle tilting an antenna experiences. In this paper, improvements of using diversity techniques for a 2.4 GHz communication link in the maritime environment were investigated. In particular, spatial diversity, which uses independent multiple antennas to achieve a level of performance one antenna could not, was employed. The use of selection diversity, a type of spatial diversity that selects the antenna branch with the best signal strength, to compensate antenna misalignment is considered and analyzed. A transmitter and receiver front-end incorporating selection diversity were designed and implemented. Results prove that the use of the proposed scheme increase the overall gain of the communication link. There is an average of 1.35 dB and 5.3 dB increase for 2 and 3 antennas respectively, in using receive diversity compared to no diversity, and an average of 2.4 dB increase in using 3 antenna transmit diversity as opposed to no diversity, all of which were exposed to continuous tilting conditions. The presented plots exhibit a general trend showing that selection diversity reduces the received signal strength fluctuations to lower power, and minimizes the losses due to antenna misalignment.","antenna branch,transmitter front-end,receiving antennas,receiver front-end,Transmit Diversity.,antenna arrays,Selection Diversity,Sea measurements,Transmitting antennas,communication link,independent multiple antennas,selection diversity,antenna experiences,Testing,noise figure 2.4 dB,noise figure 5.3 dB,Maritime Communication,spatial diversity,frequency 2.4 GHz,receive diversity,diversity reception,transmitting antennas,roll angle tilting,antenna transmit diversity,wave motion,Receiving antennas,Antenna Misalignment,maritime environment,marine communication,antenna misalignment compensation,UHF antennas,Receive Diversity,maritime communications,"

"boom: bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy for cooperative maritime sensing","2023","With the advancements in sensing technologies, maritime sensing has become indispensable in various domains, including logistics, weather forecasting, and marine ranching. However, transmitting large volumes of sensing data faces many challenges in the maritime environment. Firstly, the transmissions purely depend on satellite links often costly and suffer from long propagation latency. On the other hand, traditional unicast transmission results in data duplication, wasting valuable marine communication resources. With the increasing density of sensing devices, the communication distance between maritime sensors has become closer, enabling the deployment of maritime opportunistic networks consisting of device-to-device links. Rather than using unicast transmission over satellite links, employing multicast with opportunistic routing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple destinations and saves communication resources. Even though the multicast method can avoid redundancy, conducting multicast without considering the maritime characteristics (i.e., the dynamics and the distribution of sensors) may lead to inefficient data delivery. Through real-world experiments, we observe that devices located on the edges of the network have a relatively low receiving rate compared with internal ones and tend to be the bottleneck of the overall multicast progress. Based on this observation, we propose BOOM, a bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy aiming at reducing multicast latency, taking into account the influence of the bottleneck node and broadcasting rate. Prominently, within maritime scenarios challenged by extreme conditions such as storms, typhoons, and tsunamis, BOOMâ€™s emphasis encompasses the adaptability of multicast strategies, which necessitates dynamic adjustments in response to equipment failures and shifts in network topology. Through mathematical analysis, we prove the formation of opportunistic multicast is an NP-hard problem and further design a heuristic algorithm based on the convex-hull method to reduce the computational cost in strategy generation. We compare BOOM with four other algorithms using real-world maritime vessel trajectories in various scenarios. The simulation result illustrates that the BOOM achieves a significant reduction in transmission latency, which reduces 36% when sensors are sparsely located in water areas, and the reduction could reach up to 59% when sensors are more dense. Furthermore, in extreme environmental testing conditions, BOOM continues to outperform other algorithms in terms of completion time, with performance improvements of up to 39% and 49% in sparse and dense topology environments respectively.","Data communication,Sensors,Task analysis,Maritime Sensing,Multicast Strategy,Marine vehicles,Satellite broadcasting,Wireless sensor networks,Opportunistic Multicast,Unicast,"
"robust cellular communications for unmanned aerial vehicles in maritime search and rescue","2019","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a promising technology for fast, large scale survey operations such as maritime search and rescue (SAR). However, providing reliable communications over long distances remains a challenge. Cellular technology such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) is designed to perform well in the presence of fast-moving clients and highly dynamic channel conditions. Yet, its generic medium access mechanisms make it hard to support low-latency uplink traffic, which is needed for real-time command and control and similar applications. In this paper, we introduce an unmanned aerial system for maritime SAR, supported via an LTE data link. To mitigate drawbacks in uplink channel access, we develop a resource-guaranteed scheme based on persistent scheduling, using an open-source LTE stack. The approach is evaluated with a laboratory setup using software-defined radio modules. Measurements are taken on the application layer, using realworld telemetry data generated by an autopilot system in the presence of high bandwidth background traffic. Evaluations demonstrate that our system fulfills UAV requirements in terms of latency and reliability.

"the regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on vdes","2023","In order to provide more collision avoidance information to ships that may encounter each other in dense sea areas, prevent collision events, and minimize channel data pressure, ensure network reliability and reduce latency, this paper proposes a regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on VDES (High Frequency Data Exchange System). Based on the theoretical foundation of the ship domain model in the field of ships, the area where collision danger exists is found by guiding the ship domain model, and this area is used as the routing flood area, and the routing request is limited to this area. The improved AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing forwarding algorithm is used to establish a communication link between ships in the routing request area using real-time location information. This can exchange more information with ships located in the collision risk area to assist in collaborative obstacle avoidance and prevent accidents. At the same time, it effectively avoids network-wide routing flooding, avoids network congestion, and ensures network stability. Simulation analysis shows that this protocol is superior to AIS in terms of delivery rate and delay on the basis of realizing business functions. This will be beneficial for obstacle avoidance between encountering ships.","channel data pressure,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Delays,marine navigation,AODV routing protocol,regional protocol,communication link,routing protocols,high frequency data exchange system,ship field model,collision danger,collision risk area,Routing protocols,ships,marine safety,Stability criteria,collision avoidance information,network-wide routing flooding,telecommunication congestion control,mobile radio,Sea surface,routing request area,Collaboration,collaborative obstacle avoidance,collision events,dense sea areas,routing flood area,encountering ships,Routing,mobile robots,real-time location information,collision avoidance,ship domain model,VDES,local communications,network reliability,regional routing protocol,"

To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations.

"location-aware dynamic beam scheduling for maritime communication systems","2018","Currently, LTE cellular systems provide an excellent solution to broadband multimedia data transmission on intensive coverage area.

"supporting maritime search and rescue missions through uas-based wireless localization","2018","The use of unmanned aircraft systems to support maritime search and rescue missions holds great potential. Applications range from the fast and efficient search of vessels and persons in distress to the provision of rescue and communication resources. In this paper, we address a received signal strength based localization method of persons without dedicated search and rescue equipment. The specific challenge addressed in this work is to analyze the proposed localization method under realistic conditions. Thus, a maritime channel model is implemented and by means of field tests experimentally validated. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated in a two step concept: In the first step the capability of different search patterns and localization algorithms is analyzed and evaluated in a hardware in the loop simulation environment. In the second step, a scaled experimental setup, which uses a technology comparable to cellular communications, is evaluated to prove the viability of the overall system. Besides the overall accuracy, the required localization time is a key performance indicator. The resulting outcome of the simulations using active trajectory generation underlines the potential of the discussed approach by achieving localization errors of lower than 200 m in under 10 mins.

To reduce the model complexity and improve the mathematical tractability, a novel beam domain channel model (BDCM) is then proposed based on the transformation of the corresponding GBSM from the array domain to the beam domain for maritime communications. In the proposed BDCM, the beamforming matrices suitable for UCA structures are constructed and their invertibility is demonstrated to ensure the practicability of the BDCM. Two methods are used to characterize the array non-stationarity in maritime massive MIMO channels.

The key aim is to assist the detection and early identification and tracking of moving targets (e.g. With moving target indication and data fusion/correlation capabilities), as well as methods for obstacle detection and maritime surveillance. Maritime mobile services have to exchange real time data with multiple maritime/aerial assets no matter where the operation is conducted (close to harbors or at the open sea) and independently from the existing surveillance infrastructure. The proposed approach is also useful for the detection of marine pollution incidents. This innovative single window solution presents high efficiency, low operational costs' profiles and possibly contributes to standardization in construction as it utilizes typical tracking infrastructure and typical mobile devices (smartphones and tablets/ipads) & PCs.","real time data exchange,Mobile Vessel Surveillance,surveillance,surveillance infrastructure,sensor fusion,mobile geoinformatics,maritime/aerial assets,Safety,correlation capabilities,image motion analysis,Mobile Maritime Security,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Mobile Geoinformatics,multiple tracking sensors,Mobile communication,geophysical image processing,moving objects tracking,object tracking,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,object detection,mobile computing,early identification,Radar tracking,Prototypes,obstacle detection,geographic information systems,marine pollution incidents detection,correlation methods,marine pollution,maritime mobile services,mobile detection,moving target indication,mobile data fusion,maritime safety,"
"passive maritime surveillance using satellite communication signals","2017","In this paper, the feasibility of a bistatic passive system for maritime surveillance and marine navigation is considered based on the communication satellite constellation Inmarsat as a source of illuminating signals. A power budget analysis is detailed for Inmarsat signals, considering both the reference and the radar channels. The effect of sea clutter is also examined. It is shown that relatively poor range resolution can be improved if the available communication channels are combined to improve the bandwidth, a process that also improves the sensitivity.

"geographical aodv protocol for multi-hop maritime communications","2013","Route request (RREQ) message is flooded to find a route in ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. This flooding of RREQ generates severe overheads in a maritime multi-hop ad-hoc network (MMANet) due to limited small bandwidth. In this paper, to improve the throughput of bandwidth-limited MMANet, we propose a geographical AODV (GAODV) protocol. The key feature of the GAODV is the selective broadcast of RREQ using position information. The routing overhead-traffic of the GAODV is smaller than that of AODV. This routing overhead-traffic reduction of the GAODV is more increased as the density of ship increases.","Satellites,routing protocols,RREQ message,marine communication,ad hoc networks,ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol,MMANet,geographical AODV protocol,route request message,maritime multihop ad-hoc network,GAODV protocol,multihop maritime communication,selective broadcast,telecommunication traffic,routing overhead-traffic reduction,AODV routing protocol,"

"a novel transmission scheduling based on deep reinforcement learning in software-defined maritime communication networks","2019","With increasingly diversified communication services of ship users, quality of service (QoS) for data transmission becomes a bottleneck restricting the development of maritime communication. Aiming to solve this problem, firstly, a software-defined framework for maritime communication is presented to tackle the communication mode barrier in heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, under this framework, we propose a novel transmission scheduling scheme based on the enhanced deep Q-learning algorithm, which combines deep Q-network with softmax multiple classifier, also known as S-DQN algorithm. This scheme also mentions what the purpose of the optimization is (i.e., delay, cost, energy). We first employ Markov decision processes (MDPs) to achieve optimal scheduling strategy. Moreover, system builds up mapping relation between obtained information and optimal strategy by utilizing deep Q-network, and when incoming data arrives, it will make optimal strategy as fast as possible and accurately after a plethora of data self-learning. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the other traditional scheme in terms of different QoS, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Markov processes,softmax multiple classifier,S-DQN algorithm,optimal scheduling strategy,telecommunication computing,data transmission,quality of service,Marine vehicles,marine vehicle communication,neural networks,Reinforcement learning,Neural networks,ship users,telecommunication scheduling,deep reinforcement learning,data self-learning,enhanced deep Q-learning algorithm,Markov decision processess,software defined networking,optimisation,Artificial intelligence,heterogeneous networks,communication services,software-defined framework,marine communication,deep Q-network,Deep learning,communication mode barrier,artificial intelligence,learning (artificial intelligence),software-defined maritime communication networks,novel transmission scheduling,"
"cross-layer analysis of error control in underwater wireless sensor networks","2012","Several error control schemes have been introduced for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) to combat the effects of high error rates. However, these schemes have only been evaluated based on point-to-point communication metrics and do not consider the different underwater propagation phenomena. On the other hand, the unique properties of UWSNs such as the three-dimensional architecture and the underwater channel characteristics prevent existing studies of error control schemes for terrestrial sensor networks to be applied to this domain. In this paper, a cross-layer analysis framework is developed to evaluate existing error control techniques in three-dimensional multi-hop UWSNs. The developed framework captures the effects of automatic repeat request (ARQ), forward error correction (FEC), and hybrid ARQ schemes on end-to-end energy, latency, and packet error rate. In addition, different underwater propagation phenomena are considered with a particular attention on the presence of shadow zones. The theoretical analysis and the numerical evaluations reveal that exploiting FEC schemes with channel-aware routing reduces the end-to-end energy consumption and latency under all propagation phenomena for all water depths in UWSNs. The selection of the suitable error control scheme depends also on the water depth (shallow/deep water) and on the different underwater propagation phenomena.","Underwater networking,ARQ,Hybrid ARQ,Cross-layer analysis,FEC,"
"global navigation satellite systems performance analysis and augmentation strategies in aviation","2017","In an era of significant air traffic expansion characterized by a rising congestion of the radiofrequency spectrum and a widespread introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are being exposed to a variety of threats including signal interferences, adverse propagation effects and challenging platform-satellite relative dynamics. Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After designing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS + A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA).","Differential GNSS,High-integrity systems,Aerospace electronic systems,Air navigation,Avionics,Integrity monitoring,GNSS augmentation,Cyber-physical systems,Ground based augmentation system,Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring,Safety-critical aviation applications,Aircraft based augmentation system,Aviation security,GNSS performance,Global navigation satellite system,Satellite based augmentation system,"

The main challenge in such environments with limited localization, communication range, and the total number of UAVs and sensors is to implement an appropriate search strategy so that a target vessel can be detected as soon as possible. Thus we present informed and non-informed methods used to search the environment. The informed method relies on an obtained probabilistic map, while the non-informed method navigates the UAVs along predefined paths computed with respect to the environment. The vessel detection method is trained on synthetic data collected in the simulator with data annotation tools.

"classification of small boats in infrared images for maritime surveillance","2010","Autonomous round-the-clock observation of wide critical maritime areas can be a powerful support for border protection agencies to avoid criminal acts like illegal immigration, piracy or drug trafficking. These criminal acts are often accomplished by using small boats to decrease the probability of being uncovered. In this paper, we present an image exploitation approach to detect and classify maritime objects in infrared image sequences recorded from an autonomous platform. We focus on high robustness and generality with respect to variations of boat appearance, image quality, and environmental condition. A fusion of three different detection algorithms is performed to create reliable alarm hypotheses. In the following, a set of well-investigated features is extracted from the alarm hypotheses and evaluated using a two-stage-classification with support vector machines (SVMs) in order to distinguish between three object classes: clutter, irrelevant objects and suspicious boats.

A new simulator was built to address the particularities of the wireless models required to correctly understand the application scenario. The models provide realistic channel simulation, along with additive interference from other sources, where all transmissions are considered independently.

"ethical mission definition and execution for maritime robots under human supervision","2018","Experts and practitioners have worked long and hard toward achieving functionally capable robots. While numerous areas of progress have been achieved, ethical control of unmanned systems meeting legal requirements has been elusive and problematic. Common conclusions that treat ethical robots as an always-amoral philosophical conundrum requiring undemonstrated morality-based artificial intelligence are simply not sensible or repeatable. Patterning after successful practice by human teams shows that precise mission definition and task execution using well-defined, syntactically valid vocabularies is a necessary first step. Addition of operational constraints enables humans to place limits on robot activities, even when operating at a distance under gapped communications. Semantic validation can then be provided by a Mission Execution Ontology to confirm that no logical or legal contradictions are present in mission orders. Thorough simulation, testing, and certification of qualified robot responses are necessary to build human authority and trust when directing ethical robot operations at a distance. Together these capabilities can provide safeguards for autonomous robots possessing the potential for lethal force.

"deep reinforcement learning based joint edge resource management in maritime network","2020","Due to the rapid development of the maritime networks, there has been a growing demand for computation-intensive applications which have various energy consumption, transmission bandwidth and computing latency requirements. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can efficiently minimize computational latency by offloading computation tasks by the terrestrial access network. In this work, we introduce a space-air-ground-sea integrated network architecture with edge and cloud computing components to provide flexible hybrid computing service for maritime service. In the integrated network, satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide the users with edge computing services and network access. Based on the architecture, the joint communication and computation resource allocation problem is modelled as a complex decision process, and a deep reinforcement learning based solution is designed to solve the complex optimization problem.

"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.","research-only test units,Ocean Aero vehicles,Vehicle dynamics,operational value,autonomous navigation capabilities,mission progress monitoring,Cherokee Nation capabilities-based assessment process,UxS,remotely controlled information capture tools,Sensor systems,ocean surface,unmanned maritime systems,ground robot technologies,autonomy,terrestrial communications,maritime unmanned systems,onboard vehicle decision-making,command-and-control communication architecture,mission data transfer,satellite communication,multidomain communication systems,Testing,Vehicles,command-and-control,mission requirements,purpose-built systems,BVLOS,autonomous underwater vehicles,rugged missions,Sea surface,telecontrol,multimission intelligent autonomous maritime systems,testing team,data collection examples,CNSP,sensors,decision making,intelligent autonomy,persistent navigation capabilities,situational awareness,surface vehicle technologies,command and control systems,visual line of sight,path planning,mission management awareness,satellite communications,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,sample test cases,test and evaluation,unmanned systems,UXS,Visualization,customized mission-centric sensors,maritime domains,Tools,surface vehicles,operational mission scenarios,surface vehicle systems,remote operator control station,University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center,Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs,intelligent autonomous underwater vehicles,"

"experimental attenuation coefficient estimation for fso links over maritime area during summer time","2021","Terrestrial free space optical (FSO) links can achieve very high performance characteristics with relative low operational cost and easy installation. However, the impact of various weather and atmospheric phenomena, such as atmospheric turbulence, absorption and scattering decrease the FSO performance and availability. These phenomena are responsible for rapid fluctuations of the intensity of the laser beam which can be modeled through the appropriate statistical distributions. In this work, the correlation between relative humidity, temperature and wind speed with the atmospheric attenuation factor of a terrestrial horizontal FSO system above the sea is estimated by extracting an experimental model for the evaluation of linkâ€™s attenuation. The FSO link has been installed at the entrance of the Piraeus Port. The comparison between the experimental attenuation coefficient of the optical power received and the extracted empirical model will prove the validity of the model.

Recently, a standardization of VHF Data Exchange (VDE) to provide information and multimedia data exchange between ships and shore stations is underway. Unlike the conventional communication networks, the communication quality of marine networks is influenced by the height of the sea wave, the height of the shore stations, and the density and location of ships.

"challenges and opportunities in managing maritime networks","2008","Maritime networks are one of the least studied network configurations. Such networks are composed of a number of mobile wireless nodes typical of MANETs, but also have fixed (satellite) links and are continuously powered as is typical of fixed networks. Combined, these characteristics provide unique challenges not conducive to the use of existing MANET or fixed network management techniques. Since maritime units also operate in a low-bandwidth environment with varying communications capabilities, the efficiency of network management services is critical. Similarly, the lack of power constraints and slower mobility require a less dynamic solution than that required for MANETs. This article provides an overview of the maritime network management problem space including two key management opportunities provided by such an environment. The first opportunity is in automation. Maritime networks are subject to changing operational requirements, while at the same time suffering from limited availability of skilled network operators. To rapidly respond to faults and changes in performance needs, we propose the use of a serviceoriented policy-based management architecture on which a wide variety of management services can be rapidly deployed. The second key management opportunity is resource optimization. We suggest several management services that can be used to support traffic engineering. In our simulations traffic monitoring, traffic prioritization, adaptive routing, and resource reservation services were found to provide awareness and significantly improve the timeliness of prioritized flows.","Traffic control,Satellites,fixed network management techniques,Engineering management,telecommunication network routing,mobility management (mobile radio),Monitoring,maritime networks management,Resource management,service-oriented policy-based management architecture,low-bandwidth environment,power constraints,traffic monitoring simulations,resource optimization,Environmental management,Availability,adaptive routing,ad hoc networks,traffic engineering,traffic prioritization,mobile wireless nodes,MANETs,telecommunication traffic,network configurations,Routing,Automation,Mobile ad hoc networks,"

Operators can be based on the analysis to understand the trend of navigation ships in water bodies as an important reference. From the results of the analysis, we constructed a representable navigational information system. Different information was unified on a Geographical Information System (GIS) in two-and three-dimensional formats.

"fuzzy/human risk analysis for maritime situational awareness and decision support","2017","Human computation (HC) is an active research field in which people play a notable role as computational elements in an automated system with the aim of arriving at a truly symbiotic human-computer interaction. Situational awareness (SA) and decision support systems (DSSs) are two domains where human computation is rapidly advancing, with the latter arising as an invaluable vehicle to achieve the former. Fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are two commonly employed tools in these domains due to their inherent capabilities of representing and processing vague and imprecise information while conveying the analysis results in an interpretable fashion. In this paper, we elaborate on the human computation aspects of risk analysis within SA and DSS conducted with the aid of fuzzy sets.

"hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial maritime networks: network selection for users on a vessel optimized with transmit power and uav position","2022","The hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial maritime networks have shown great promise for broadband coverage at sea. The existing works focused on vessels collaboratively served by UAV-enabled aerial base station (ABSs) and terrestrial base stations (TBSs) deployed along the coast, and proved that data rate could be improved by optimizing transmit power and ABS's position. In practice, users on a vessel can be collaboratively served by an ABS and a vessel-enabled base station (VBS) in different networks. In this case, how to select the network for users on a vessel is still an open issue. In this paper, a TBS and a satellite respectively provide wireless backhaul for the ABS and the VBS. The network selection is jointly optimized with transmit power of ABS and VBS, and ABS's position for improving data rate of all users.

"multi-radio multi-channel assignment algorithm in maritime wireless mesh networks","2019","The recent growth in the maritime industry stemming to increase in global commerce as well as searching for hydrocarbons at offshore locations, the high data rate and cost affordable maritime communication is acquired. A mesh network is envisaged for maritime communications because of its expanded coverage, self-healing, and high-capacity. With the development of multi-radio technology, the frequency interference can be decreased sharply with proper channel assignment. The static channel assignment optimization is often applied to decrease the wireless frequency interference which is known as an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we focus on the static channel assignment issue and propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The problem is addressed by assigning channels to communication links to minimize the interference from overall network. A modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the problem, and a new merging solution is adopted to reassign channels for nodes, which violate the radio constraints. Multi-radio simulation is performed in NS-3 to validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel assignment algorithm. The results show that the algorithm is able to find an optimized assignment with fewer iterations than the previous work and improve network performance.","radio constraints,multiradio simulation,channel allocation,Land surface,wireless mesh networks,Wireless mesh networks,static channel assignment issue,multiradio technology,Wireless communication,static channel assignment optimization,particle swarm optimisation,Channel allocation,modified particle swarm optimization algorithm,mesh network,Network topology,offshore locations,maritime wireless mesh networks,communication links,channel assignment,wireless frequency interference,Multi-radio multi-channel,marine communication,maritime industry,channel assignment algorithm,Interference,Heuristic algorithms,network performance,maritime communications,multiradio multichannel assignment algorithm,NP-hard problem,"

We derive a bound for the range where mitigation of deep fading is guaranteed and evaluate this bound through numerical searching methods utilizing a realistic channel model that considers the curvature of the earth. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme leads to a better system performance compared with a free space scenario in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, if four or more antennas are employed at the base station.","telecommunication network reliability,two-ray channels,antenna array configuration,fading mitigation,antenna arrays,coherent sea surface reflection,base station,Space communications,reliability,Vehicular and wireless technologies,Wireless communication,reliable communications,deep fading,Maritime communications,Reflection,System performance,maritime environments,numerical searching methods,Sea surface,multiple antennas,wireless communications,system performance,search problems,communication range,marine communication,multiple antenna systems,MIMO communication,deep fades,Base stations,fading channels,"

"attribute-based secure data aggregation for isolated iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","With global economic integration, transnational trade plays an important role, and maritime transportation is one of the important means of freight transportation. It is of great significance to build a secure and efficient maritime transportation system (MTS). The introduction of Internet of things technology makes MTS more perfect. The IoT-enabled MTS is composed of marine terminals and on-board sensors, land-based data centers and base stations, as well as satellite networks. Many researchers have carried out significant work to aggregate data in MTS. However, because the terrestrial base stations cannot cover most of the sea area, the isolated maritime terminals, those who drive to the area without base station coverage, need the assistance of satellite networks to complete the contact with the data center. In this paper, we propose an attribute based secure data aggregation scheme for isolated IoT-enabled MTS. In the novel scheme, the constant attributes of a maritime terminal are utilized to generate its certification. In addition, on-board sensors are introduced in the system to help aggregate the status and surrounding environment of the maritime terminal. These monitoring data are encrypted by the sensors and transmitted to the data center for the trustworthiness evaluation of the isolated maritime terminal.

"efficient energy and delay tradeoff for vessel communications in sdn based maritime wireless networks","2021","The maritime communication network is assembled by emergent network technologies. However, the adverse maritime environment impedes the efficiency of resources allocation in maritime communication network. Here we show a joint sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission scheme in delay-tolerant maritime wireless communication networks based on software defined networking (SDN) to find a better tradeoff between the energy consumption and the delay. Specifically, an energy-limited delay tolerant networking (DTN) node deployed in the ocean receives/transmits data from/to vessels within its communication range. To further save the energy, a long-term energy minimization problem is formulated with sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission.

A formation control system based on intermittent broadcast, rather than the traditional distributed control system, is established based on a leader-follower strategy. During the process of formation moving, the input constraints, vehicle collision avoidance and input saturation needed to be noted. To this end, the model predictive control algorithm is employed to design the formation controller, and the stability of the formation control system is proved by the average residence time notion and Lyapunov stability.

"statistical modeling of evaporation duct channel for maritime broadband communications","2022","The sixth-generation communication networks aim to integrate space, air, and ground communications into a robust network. However, maritime communications are confronted with the challenge of the atmospheric duct, which could capture wireless signals and propagate beyond the line of sight. In this paper, a parabolic equation-based modeling approach is proposed to characterize the maritime evaporation duct channel. The constant coefficients of each variable in the modeling are calculated by the least square method, and the specific distribution of shadow fading in channel modeling is determined by the Kullback-Leibler divergence method.

"collaborative multiple access and energy-efficient resource allocation in distributed maritime wireless networks","2022","With the rapid increasing of maritime activities, maritime wireless networks (MWNs) with high reliability, high energy efficiency, and low delay are required. However, the centralized networking with fixed resource scheduling is not suitable for MWNs due to the special environment. In this paper, we introduce the collaborative relay communication in distributed MWNs to improve the link reliability, and propose an orthogonal time-frequency resource block reservation based multiple access (RRMA) scheme for both one-hop direct link and two-hop collaborative relay link to reduce the interference. To further improve the network performance, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization resource allocation problem and solve it by an iterative algorithm based on the Dinkelbach method. Finally, numerical results are provided to investigate the proposed RRMA scheme and resource allocation algorithm, showing that the low outage probability and transmission delay can be attained by the proposed RRMA scheme.

"packet transport for maritime communications: a streaming coded udp approach","2022","The maritime communication network (MCN) plays an important role in the 6th generation (6G) system development. In MCNs, packet transport over long-distance lossy links will be ubiquitous. Transmission control protocol (TCP), the dominant transport protocol in the past decades, have had performance issues in such links. In this paper, we propose a novel transport approach which uses user datagram protocol (UDP) along with a simple yet effective bandwidth estimator for congestion control, and with a proactive packet-level forward erasure correction (FEC) code called streaming code to provide low-delay loss recovery without data retransmissions at all. We show that the approach can effectively address two issues of the state-of-the-art TCP variants in the long-distance lossy links, namely 1) the low bandwidth utilization caused by the slow increase of the congestion window (CWND) due to long round-trip time (RTT) and the frequent CWND drop due to random and congestion losses, and 2) the high end-to-end in-order delivery delay when re-transmissions are incurred to recover lost packets. In addition, we show that the scheme's goodput has good smoothness and short-term intra-protocol fairness properties, which are beneficial for multimedia streaming and interactive applications that are prominent parts of today's wireless traffic.","Decoding,Encoding,low-delay loss recovery,streaming code,Delays,transport protocols,congestion window,Maintenance engineering,UDP approach,state-of-the-art TCP,proactive packet-level forward erasure correction code,simple yet effective bandwidth estimator,multimedia streaming,Maritime communications,transmission control protocol,short-term intra-protocol fairness properties,Propagation losses,congestion control,telecommunication congestion control,packet transport,random congestion losses,good smoothness,protocols,dominant transport protocol,forward error correction,Bandwidth,low bandwidth utilization,maritime communication network,lost packets,long-distance lossy links,forward-erasure correction,maritime communications,novel transport approach,user datagram protocol,generation system development,"
"shipping lane-aware caching and transmission scheme for maritime wireless networks","2020","The shipping lane is one of the most important information of vessels, which is useful in maritime communications. This paper presents a cache-enabled maritime communication network architecture where the shipborne base stations with the cache storages serve as the relay points between the user ships and the shore based networks. Under this architecture, we promote the total network throughput by exploiting the specific characteristics of the maritime shipping lane information. In particular, we use the shipping lanes to calculate the large-scale channel state information (CSI) and predict the future user associations. We propose a shipping lane aware cross-layer resource allocation algorithm to optimize the system throughput in terms of the caching strategy, power allocation and bandwidth allocation, which is a mix-integer non-convex programming problem. We divide the original problem into a capacity optimization problem and a caching placement problem. The capacity optimization problem is relaxed into a large-scale-CSI-only convex problem and solved by Lagrangian dual method. The caching placement problem is solved by a greedy algorithm.

All these scenarios require the integration between the real time data acquisition and dynamic GIS. The proposed Vital Electronic System for Maritime Applications (SYSTEM) integrates: a land or sea-based Data Center; a 'Mother Ship' (used for sensor deployment and local data collection); and a large number of easily deployed, disposable, intercommunicating, and intelligent 'Floaters' (equipped with task-specific sensors). An embedded Vital Electronics Computer composed of a hierarchical network of a large number of wireless PSoC-based GNODEs (configurable at deployment), forms the core of SYSTEM.

"automatic gain control for asm channel in maritime communication","2015","This paper presents Automatic Gain Control (AGC) algorithm in maritime communication system using application specific message (ASM). In maritime communication, gain control is not easy than land mobile communication. Received signal is converted to digital signal by analog to digital converter (ADC). If the signal input power of ADC is smaller than adequate power then quantization noise increases. On the contrary, if the signal input power of ADC is large than adequate power then the output signal of ADC is saturated. This paper proposes essential algorithm that controls gain value effectively in case that received signal power and propagation delay are unknown. We first analyze the general method of AGC in maritime communication. The analysis will show that the time for gain convergence is needed and much longer than known case because the distance from transmitting ship to receiving ship is randomly distributed and unknown in each slot. The difference of gain values in each slot is as large as 100dB in maximum case. The larger a difference of gain values is, the longer gain convergence time is. This is because that any ship can transmit in any slot randomly, therefore, received signal power is not expectable. We show how proposed algorithm can effectively control the gain value in maritime communication environments. Result of simulation shows that the utilization of proposed algorithm can calculate the optimal gain value and regenerate optimal signal that is similar with original source. As a result, proposed AGC algorithm changes all gain values of total received signal into same gain value using back gain compensation. Especially, the gain value of received signal should be controlled in adequate because transmission randomly occurs in each slot in maritime communication. Proposed automatic gain control algorithm is essential and effective for stable demodulation performance in ASM maritime communication.","ASM channel,auto gain control,analog to digital converter,Gain control,Marine vehicles,Delays,Propagation delay,automatic gain control algorithm,Hardware,AIS,gain compensation,analogue-digital conversion,maritime communication,application specific message,ADC,AGC algorithm,automatic gain control,marine communication,Algorithm design and analysis,re-scaling,ASM,Demodulation,"

"optimization of lte radio resource block allocation for maritime channels","2016","In this study, we describe the behavior of LTE over the sea and investigate the problem of radio resource block allocation in such SINR limited maritime channels.

After exploiting the network characteristics, we formulated and solved the radio resource allocation problem by max-min integer linear programming method. The radio resource allocation fairness in terms of Jain's fairness index was computed and it was compared with round robin and opportunistic methods. Results show that the max-min optimization method performs better than the opportunistic and round robin methods. This result in turn reflects that the max-min optimization method gives us the high minimum best throughput as compared to other two methods considering different ship density scenarios in the sea.

"maritime smuggling detection and mitigation using risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks","2017","With the rise of more resourceful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), their inclusion into robotic sensor networks (RSNs) is inevitable. The highly mobile nature of UAVs allows greater monitoring capabilities, making them most suitable for RSNs. Compared to traditional nodes in RSNs, UAVs suffer even more from communication disruptions and energy depletion, must often rapidly determine actions for themselves, and consequently require more autonomy. Prior work has been done in wireless sensor network (WSN)/aerial sensor network (ASN) coordination in a few applications such as protecting critical infrastructure, restoring communication between nodes, and healing networks, while other work has been accomplished on using the UAV network for augmenting the monitoring capabilities of WSNs. We introduce a novel methodology to integrate UAVs into RSNs for monitoring purposes by formulating the problem in the context of a risk management framework (RMF). This methodology allows a more precise risk feature classification and a more efficient task allocation for the ground network by utilizing the monitoring capabilities of the UAVs to informatively warn the RSN of any incoming events.

"privacy protection technology of maritime multi-agent communication based on part-federated learning","2021","Federated learning is a machine learning model based on distributed data sets, which builds a global model under the premise of ensuring the privacy and data security of participants. Because of this characteristic, federated learning is very suitable for maritime communication systems with large amounts of distributed data. However, the data set of maritime multi-agent communication system is different from the general data set, and the data distribution is not uniform, which increases the deviation of the model. In this paper, we propose a Part-Federated Learning (PFL) method which combines the advantages of split learning to improve the classical federated learning. This method, only uploading some parameters in the local model to the cloud server as shared parameters, reduces the communication cost of distributed learning, improves the privacy of the algorithm to the data, and has better performance in processing non-IDD distributed data. We optimize the proportion of shared parameters of PFL by considering the convergence of the algorithm and the communication cost. Finally, we verify the advantages of the algorithm in processing non-IID data through experiments, simulate the process of parameter optimization, and prove the feasibility of the algorithm.","shared parameters,parameter optimization,Maritime multi-agent,Data privacy,Collaborative work,privacy protection technology,Costs,security of data,distributed learning,distributed data sets,Distributed databases,data distribution,Servers,marine engineering,cloud computing,machine learning,maritime multiagent communication system,Data models,part-federated learning,split learning,nonIDD distributed data,Mobile Systems,Part-Federated Learning,Distance learning,communication cost reduction,data security,marine communication,PFL,cloud server,Global Imbalanced Data,learning (artificial intelligence),multi-agent systems,data privacy,global model,"

"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process. The technologies used in developing the virtual world and incorporating the real time information in to the virtual world is presented in simplified modal for the purpose of clarity.

"characterization of maritime rf/fso channel","2011","The growing demand on high speed data transmission as well as the bandwidth limitation of microwave (RF) transmission has stimulated the development of free-space optical (FSO) laser communication links during the last years. Making the data transmission reliable is one of the challenging problems that have to be solved to establish a communication system suitable for commercial usage. Optical transmission is highly impacted by different channel conditions, leading from signal damping to turbulence effects due to the atmosphere.

"reducing cyclic prefix overhead based on symbol repetition in nb-iot-based maritime communication","2022","With the increasing maritime activities, a great demand of wide-area maritime digital data services is needed. Therefore, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) that can provide wide coverage has been expected as an application for maritime communication networks (MCNS). In this paper, we aim to enhance the spectral efficiency in NB-IoT by reducing the cyclic prefix (CP) overhead in random access signal without causing interference. The key point of the proposed scheme is the symbols transmitted for multiple times repeatedly in NB-IoT. Specifically, all CP are removed and multi-path fading effect is eliminated by using a repeated symbol to cover the disturbed symbol to construct a circular convolution structure of the channel with the same effect as adding CP. In addition, a single-tap equalization is still appropriate. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, simulation results are carried out with respect to the bit error ratio (BER).","narrowband physical random access channel,bit error ratio,Internet of Things,Time-domain analysis,wide area maritime digital data services,interference,multipath fading effect,symbol repetition,circular convolution structure,cyclic prefix,single tap equalization,error statistics,spectral efficiency,OFDM,multipath channels,disturbed symbol,Discrete Fourier transforms,radiofrequency interference,repeated symbol,NB-IoT-based maritime communication,NB-IoT,Narrowband,Symbols,equalisers,marine communication,Signal to noise ratio,maritime communication networks,cyclic prefix overhead,Spectral efficiency,maritime activities,fading channels,"

Although GNSS has been proven to be vulnerable to jamming when the signal strength is weak, most vehicles rely on it for navigation. Compared to GNSS, enhanced Loran (eLoran) is more resistant to jamming and is recommended as a realistic alternative to GNSS. Therefore, South Korea embarked on an eLoran testbed development project to provide resilient navigation information for maritime users. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate that the system can provide a 20-m position accuracy to the maritime user within a 30-km coverage of a differential Loran station.

"environmental information-aided electromagnetic propagation testbed for maritime communication","2023","Maritime channel modeling can be affected by some key time-varying environmental factors. The ducting effect is one of the thorniest factors since it causes anomalous propagation enhancement and severe co-channel interference.

In this paper, we propose an environmental information-aided electromagnetic propagation testbed. It is based on complex refractivity estimation and improved parabolic equation propagation model, taking into account both ducting effect and atmospheric attenuation. A large-scale temporal and spatial propagation measurement was conducted with meteorological acquisition.

"lstm-based distributed conditional generative adversarial network for data-driven 5g-enabled maritime uav communications","2023","5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is one of the important applications of 5G wireless network which requires minimum latency and higher reliability to support mission-critical applications. Therefore, lossless reliable communication with a high data rate is the key requirement in modern wireless communication systems. These all factors highly depend upon channel conditions. In this work, a channel model is proposed for air-to-surface link exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) for 5G enabled maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication. Firstly, we will present the formulated channel estimation method which directly aims to adopt channel state information (CSI) of mmWave from the channel model inculcated by UAV operating within the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-Distributed Conditional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) i.e. (LSTM-DCGAN) for each beamforming direction. Secondly, to enhance the applications for the proposed trained channel model for the spatial domain, we have designed an LSTM-DCGAN based UAV network, where each one will learn mmWave CSI for all the distributions. Lastly, we have categorized the most favorable LSTM-DCGAN training method and emanated certain conditions for our UAV network to increase the channel model learning rate.

"sampling-based path planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles to reduce uncertainty in range-only localization","2019","The following letter presents an adaptive path planning algorithm for cooperative localization in the maritime environment. It considers the scenario where an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) acts as a Communication and Navigation Aid (CNA) to support Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with range measurements. As AUVs have no access to GPS while submerged, range measurements can bind the otherwise continuously growing navigational error. This can be done by methods such as range-only Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). In such methods, the resulting uncertainty and positional error depends on the geometry between transmitter (CNA) and receiver (AUV). This letter proposes a planning algorithm that combines priority based expansion of a search tree with random sampling-based exploration to position the CNA at strategic positions to transmit ranging messages at optimal times to reduce the uncertainty and error at the AUVsâ€™ position. The approach is validated and shows an increased confidence for AUVsâ€™ localization in simulated environments as well as real experiments using a dataset gathered from AUV Sirius.","Robot localization,cooperating robots,Path planning,Uncertainty,Autonomous underwater vehicles,Acoustic communication,localization,Navigation,motion and path planning,Motion planning,marine robotics,"
"deployment strategies of mobile networks for internet-of-things in smart maritime ports","2022","It is estimated that 80% of world trade is transported via maritime logistic. The maritime trade networks can be seen as a graph with links and nodes. For an optimal network, the links representing the maritime routes must be short (with minimal cost) and secure. The nodes of the network represents the maritime ports, which are hub sending, receiving or switching the goods (in form of containers). The ports has passed from analog to digital ports to make use of IT tools to speed up the process, especially the administrative part. Nowadays, we talk about smart ports that uses data to further speed up the process administratively but also use a full automation to accelerate/optimize the processing of the goods/containers in terminals/quay. Terminal Operation System (TOS) is the main components in these operations. Therefore, the use of Internet-of-Thing (IoT) in TOS a decisive step towards smart ports. In this work, we propose to extend the notion of IoT in other smart domains to be considered in the smart port paradigm, such smart building, smart grid, smart environment monitoring, etc. Furthermore, we study the optimal strategies for the deployment of a performing networking infrastructure, which is the core element in the IoT layered model.

After analyzing the ship behavior we found that the silhouette's size and shape variation of ship in infrared image were related to its behavior over a period of time, that is to say when the distance between the own ship and the target ship has decreased during this period, its silhouette's size would increase. And when the target ship is heading toward the own ship directly and the distance between them has decreased (the DCPA (Distance to Closest Point of Approach) is very small, and the TCPA (Time to Closest Point of Approach) is decreasing), the silhouette's size of the target ship would enlarge, nevertheless, its silhouette's shape would have no significant changes. According to these characteristics of ship behavior, the height of target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's size and the ratio between the width and the height of the target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's shape in the ship behavior recognition algorithm we proposed. And then the least square method is used to fit the height and the ratio into straight line during this period respectively, whose slope reflects the changing trend and variation of target ship's silhouette. At last, the recognition algorithm was verified by analyzing infrared video in a maritime environment, which shows that the characteristic of ship behavior summarized by this paper is correct and the recognition algorithm based on them is feasible.","Time to Closest Point of Approach,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Character recognition,intelligent recognition,ship behavior,Target recognition,ships,maritime surveillance,Image recognition,DCPA,Shape,least squares approximations,video analysis,Radar,infrared image,target ship,video signal processing,ship behavior recognition algorithm,TCPA,infrared imaging,maritime environment,marine communication,least square method,infrared video,Distance to Closest Point of Approach,object recognition,"

"connectivity and route analysis for a maritime communication network","2007","We are interested in extending the coverage of a terrestrial wireless communication network to the sea so that cost effective communications can be provided to the ships. The coverage extension can be achieved by using ships as relay nodes for other ships that are further away. This paper studies the feasibility of doing so at the Singapore East Coast. The feasibility is based on having 90% of the nodes connected to the terrestrial network 90% of the times. Using actual ship mobility traces in the area, we confirm that such a network is feasible when transmission range between land station and ship is at least 15 km and transmission range between ships is at least 8 km. For a feasible network, there are always multiple candidate routes between a ship and the land station, and the average path length of the candidate routes is about 1.8. This calls for possible use of multi-path routing protocols, and the short path length implies a potentially acceptable end-to-end delay for real-time traffic.","real-time traffic,Wireless communication,routing protocols,Vehicle dynamics,marine communication,multi-path routing protocols,Underwater communication,route analysis,Communication networks,Ad hoc networks,Spread spectrum communication,Costs,connectivity analysis,Marine vehicles,Relays,Communication effectiveness,maritime communication network,"

"decentralized adaptive overcurrent protection for medium voltage maritime power systems","2016","more and more maritime applications as marine vessels and offshore platforms need an adaptive protection power system. However, the adaptive protection is yet to be implemented in the maritime sector. Usually, the adaptive protection implies the existence of a central control unit that monitors the entire electrical network and changes the relay settings accordingly, but this approach is not adequate for the maritime power systems. This paper propose a decentralized adaptive protection method, where each protection relay is able to identify by itself the network status without the need of a central control unit. The new adaptive protection method is based on communication between the overcurrent relays and the equipment that could affect the protection system, such as circuit breakers and generators.

"modeling and application of global maritime transport accessibility based on probability distribution","2023","The study of sea area accessibility is often overlooked despite the fact that vessel routesâ€™ density at sea can reflect human activity patterns.

An accessibility model for sea areas was then proposed and applied to the grid, resulting in the accessibility assessment of global sea areas in 2014 and 2018.

"diversity framed slotted aloha with interference cancellation for maritime satellite communications","2019","Providing reliable and efficient connectivity for maritime systems is a key objective to enable new services and to offer anytime-anywhere communication solutions to vessels operating in remote areas (e.g. oceans). Such a task has recently become quite compelling because of the increasing maritime traffic, which should be supported by an information distribution infrastructure in order to guarantee efficient data communication among vessels and control centres on land. To this end, satellites are the perfect candidates for achieving such an objective.

"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"tcp performance in satellite backhauling for maritime communications: a ns-3 study","2022","In maritime communications, using satellites as the backhaul is an important scenario. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the most dominant transport-layer protocol and directly affects user experience. Due to the inherent high propagation delay and random packet loss characteristics of satellite link, it may cause TCP performance be seriously affected using a satellite backhaul. To analyze the TCP performance in satellite backhauling, this paper combines the Long Term Evolution (LTE) model in ns-3 with a geostationary communication satellite model (sns3) to build a practical satellite-based backhauling system. The paper compares the throughput and latency performance of several state-of-the-art TCP variants, namely Cubic, Hybla, Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT (BBR), Copa and PCC. It is found that the TCP variants exhibit different advantages/disadvantages in different testing scenarios, suggesting that no one is a clear winner in the satellite-backhauling systems.

"two-stage offloading optimization for energyâ€“latency tradeoff with mobile edge computing in maritime internet of things","2020","The ever-increasing growth in maritime activities with large amounts of Maritime Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) devices and the exploration of ocean network leads to a great challenge for dealing with a massive amount of maritime data in a cost-effective and energy-efficient way. However, the resources-constrained maritime users cannot meet the high requirements of transmission delay and energy consumption, due to the excessive traffic and limited resources in maritime networks. To solve this problem, mobile edge computing is taken as a promising paradigm to help mobile devices from edge servers via computation offloading considering the different quality of service (QoS) with the complex ocean environments, resulting in energy saving and increased transmission latency. To investigate the tradeoff between latency and energy consumption in low-cost large-scale maritime communication, we formulate the offloading optimization problem and propose a two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm, optimizing computation and communication resource allocation under limited energy and sensitive latency. At the first stage, the maritime users make the decision on whether to offload a computation considering their demands and environments. Then, the channel allocation and power allocation problems were proposed to optimize the offloading policy which coordinates with the center cloud servers at the second stage, considering the dynamic tradeoff of latency and energy consumption. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","offloading strategies,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,computation offloading,maritime data,limited resources,ocean network,dynamic tradeoff,two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm,energy-efficiency,resources-constrained maritime users,QoS,Internet of Things,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Maritime Internet-of-Things,Resource management,large-scale maritime communication,mobile edge computing (MEC),two-stage offloading optimization,Servers,Energy???latency tradeoff,cloud computing,maritime networks,Oceans,optimisation,communication resource allocation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,energy-latency tradeoff,offloading policy,maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT),network traffic,energy saving,transmission delay,telecommunication traffic,complex ocean environments,energy consumption,mobile devices,Cloud computing,marine communication,power allocation problems,cloud server,offloading optimization problem,Task analysis,maritime activities,resource allocation,edge servers,M-IoT devices,"

"noma-based uav communications for maritime coverage enhancement","2021","The lack of communication infrastructure in the ocean inevitably leads to coverage blind zones. In addition to high-throughput marine satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to provide coverage for these blind zones along with onshore base stations. In this paper, we consider the use of UAV for maritime coverage enhancement. Particularly, to serve more ships on the vast oceanic area with limited spectrum resources, we employ non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A joint power and transmission duration allocation problem is formulated to maximize the minimum ship throughput, with the constraints on onboard communication energy. Different from previous works, we only assume the slowly time-varying large-scale channel state information (CSI) to reduce the system cost, as the large-scale CSI is location-dependent and can be obtained according to a priori radio map. To solve the non-convex problem, we decompose it into two subproblems and solve them in an iterative way.

"research on maritime rescue uav based on beidou cnss and extended square search algorithm","2020","With the development of multi-intelligence related technologies and distributed artificial intelligence, people have gradually applied drones to maritime search and rescue work. Maritime search and rescue requires high efficiency and short search time, which is difficult, and how to use UAVs for efficient and rapid maritime search and rescue has become a major concern. In this paper, based on the extended square search algorithm, the original algorithm is improved, and the probability function of target discovery is introduced to make the algorithm closer to the actual search and rescue situation. Finally, based on the MATLAB platform, this paper simulates the algorithm by writing a program, and studies the relationship between flight height, search pitch and search width overlap ratio and search time. The simulation results show that the flying height of the drone is inversely proportional to the search time, and the overlap ratio is proportional to the time.

"event-triggered cooperative formation control for autonomous surface vehicles under the maritime search operation","2022","To improve the autonomy of maritime search and rescue (SAR) operation, this paper concentrates on the formation control problem for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with the limited communication resource. A novel parallel search guidance, considering the maneuvering characteristics of ASVs, is developed to guide the formation to execute the automatic SAR operation. That can guarantee that the corresponding guidance law is highly efficient, self-driving and suitable for the large-scale formation. Combined with the guidance principle, a formation control algorithm is proposed by fuse of the event-triggered control and neural networks (NNs). In the proposed scheme, the gain uncertainty of actuators is effectively compensated requiring no prior information around the model structure. Unlike the existing results, the proposed event-triggered mechanism can activate synchronously both the controller and the NNs weight estimator.

"a comprehensive survey on security, privacy issues and emerging defence technologies for uavs","2023","In the past two decades, there has been a rapid development in the drone industry known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Currently, the use of commercial UAVs has increased a lot due to their affordability, but lack of security implementations has introduced many threats and vulnerabilities in UAVs. In addition, software, and hardware complexity in UAVs also triggers privacy and security issues as well as causes critical challenges for government, industry and academia. Firstly, in this research review, we broadly survey privacy and security issues of UAVs by dividing them into three classes: Software, Hardware and Communication.

"redesigned waveforms in the maritime medium frequency bands","2020","Several studies have shown that the signals of marine radio beacons, which operate in the maritime medium frequency (MF) band, can be modified to enable range and position estimate. This technology called Ranging Mode (R-Mode) faces challenges in the resolution of ambiguities and suppression of multipath interference which are related to the small bandwidth of 500 to 1000 Hz per radio beacon. This paper shows that increasing the overall used bandwidth per station with the transmission in two separate MF channels or using the complete maritime MF band would increase the ability to estimate the ambiguities and identify signals reflected by the ionosphere.

"use of noma for maritime communication networks with p-df relaying channel","2020","In this paper, a partial de-code-and-forward (P-DF) cooperative relaying network (CRN) with non-orthogonal multiple access (P-DF-CRN-NOMA) for maritime space communications is proposed. Without loss of generality, three kinds of relay forwarding protocols are studied to characterize the superiority of the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme, where, after receptions from the coastal base station (BS), the island relay forwards the successful decoded symbols to the ship user to avoid the performance loss provided by the high decoding requirement in decode-and-forward (DF). To further improve the system performance, as well as for a fairness comparison, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) is utilized at the ship user. Specifically, to present the impact of the channel qualities, the scenarios of the weak and strong links that from the source to destination (S-D) are both considered. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the P-DF-CRN-NOMA are derived considering the three proposed forwarding cases. Qualitative numerical results corroborating our theoretical analysis, especially for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), show that the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme significantly improves the outage probability performance in comparison to the conventional CRN-NOMA schemes. Furthermore, for an increased S-D link, the corresponding outage probability performance will be also better for all the cases.","Decoding,telecommunication network reliability,cooperative relaying networks (CRN),nonorthogonal multiple access,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),maritime space communications,outage probability,decoding,Power system reliability,NOMA,Communication networks,Relays,error statistics,power allocation,P-DF relaying channel,maximum ratio combining,cooperative relaying network,protocols,relay networks (telecommunication),diversity reception,partial decode and forward network,coastal base station,decode and forward communication,cooperative communication,probability,relay forwarding protocols,marine communication,outage probability performance,Probability,maritime communication networks,multi-access systems,island relay,partial decode-and-for-ward (P-DF),P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme,"

"joint design of channel estimation and flocking control for multi-auv-based maritime transportation systems","2023","Communication efficiency and flocking stability are two basic requirements for the application of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in maritime transportation systems. Although they are closely related, most existing flocking approaches focus on the control techniques and ignore the influence of communication efficiency. This paper presents a joint design solution to the channel estimation and flocking control for multi-AUV-based maritime transportation systems, with the consideration of path loss, shadow and multipath fading channels. A value iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) estimator is first designed to predict the channel quality of AUVs in positions that have not yet visited. With the predicted channel quality, we construct an integrated optimization problem for the co-design of communication and flocking strategies. Along with this, a value iteration-based RL flocking controller is developed to achieve the co-design of channel estimation and flocking control for AUVs. It is worth mentioning that, the value iteration-based RL estimator in this paper can avoid local optimal in traditional least-squares methods, and meanwhile the flocking controller in this paper can make a balance between flocking stability and communication efficiency for AUVs. Finally, simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed approach in this paper has superior performances by comparing with the other works. As such, our approach is more useful for marine engineer to understand and explore the maritime transportation system from the communication and control view points.","Underwater acoustics,Vehicle dynamics,Transportation,reinforcement learning,Communication-aware,Fading channels,Mathematical models,flocking,Channel estimation,autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs),Force,"
"genetic based approach for optimized routing in maritime tactical manets","2014","Ad-Hoc Networks are wireless, infrastructure less, multi hop, and dynamic networks established by a collection of mobile nodes and are commonly termed as Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). Maritime Tactical Networks (MTN), requiring high performance and security, are one of the main application areas of MANETs. Military community is redefining the way wars will be fought in open sees, progressing towards a Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) paradigm. MANETs are considered the vision of NCW, which requires thorough understanding and research for its application in the maritime environment. MTN are composed of mobile nodes (ships, submarine, aircraft etc.) and static nodes (shore stations), which can only be connected with each other through radio using the electromagnetic spectrum. The nodes operate both as hosts and routers. Due to mobility of nodes, the topology of the network may change rapidly and unexpectedly, thus setting up routes that meet high reliability is very challenging issue. Hence it is very important to find a route that can obtain highly stable routing during data transmission to undertake combined operations without interference. Moreover, nodes may not take same path because they are not stationary and have limited resources. Routing in such environment is a challenging task with the intention of utilizing minimum resources of the node and increasing the efficiency. An intelligent route optimization techniques based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to address the problem for MTN. This paper gives a multidimensional view of the challenges in MTN and proposes GA based approach for routing in MTN keeping in consideration shore-to-ship and ship-to-ship communications at any sea area.","Route Optimization,aircraft,mobile ad-hoc networks,telecommunication network routing,electromagnetic spectrum,network-centric warfare paradigm,Ad hoc networks,Sociology,Genetic Algorithm (GA),data transmission,Maritime Tactical Networks (MTN),open sees,Genetic algorithms,Mobile computing,MTN,Biological cells,shore-to-ship communications,Routing protocols,genetic algorithms,optimized routing,genetic algorithm,maritime tactical MANET,ships,telecommunication network topology,genetic based approach,maritime tactical networks,Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs),shore stations,static nodes,military community,maritime environment,ship-to-ship communications,Routing,mobile ad hoc networks,multihop network,mobile nodes,marine communication,infrastructure less network,network topology,submarine,dynamic network,military communication,wireless network,intelligent route optimization techniques,"

The proposed IoMT device and gateway play a role similar to the IoT device and gateway on land, but it is optimized for marine use with consideration of the practical characteristics of using sensors in the ocean. Furthermore, to realize long-range and high-rate communication between marine sensors and a control center (CC) on land, an automatic beam adjustment system for directional antennas is developed. This enables the use of directional antennas, which can support long-range and high-rate communication by automatically adjusting the beam angle between the antennas while exchanging their control information, despite the antennas being shifted by undulation from the sea. Finally, we conduct real sea experiments to identify the performances of the proposed IoMT platform in various environments. The results show that the proposed IoMT platform can collect data from marine sensors as well as high definition camera video from distances of 25 and 40 km to the CC on land under one-hop and two-hop transmissions, respectively.

Limitations of existing techniques, such as artificial data and small datasets, are addressed by capturing network traffic data from a real-world semiconductor production factory. 45 bidirectional network flow features are extracted, and labeled datasets are constructed for training and testing ML models. The proposed PCA-BSO algorithm is employed to select the most relevant features based on their eigenvalues, as the feature with the highest eigenvalues may not always improve classification accuracy. Supervised ML algorithms are evaluated through simulations to assess their performance.","Cyber-physical production system,Supply chain 4.0,Industrial revolution 4.0,Deep learning,information technology,Machine learning,"

"seamless and energy-efficient maritime coverage in coordinated 6g spaceâ€“airâ€“sea non-terrestrial networks","2023","Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), which integrate space and aerial networks with terrestrial systems, are a key area in the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. As part of 6G, NTNs must provide pervasive connectivity to a wide range of devices, including smartphones, vehicles, sensors, robots, and maritime users. However, due to the high mobility and deployment of NTNs, managing the space-airâ€“sea (SAS) NTN resources, i.e., energy, power, and channel allocation, is a major challenge. The design of an SAS-NTN for energy-efficient resource allocation is investigated in this study. The goal is to maximize system energy efficiency (EE) by collaboratively optimizing user equipment (UE) association, power control, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployment. Given the limited payloads of UAVs, this work focuses on minimizing the total energy cost of UAVs (trajectory and transmission) while meeting EE requirements. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is proposed, followed by the development of an algorithm to decompose, and solve each problem distributedly. The binary (UE association) and continuous (power, deployment) variables are separated using the Bender decomposition (BD), and then the Dinkelbach algorithm (DA) is used to convert fractional programming into an equivalent solvable form in the subproblem. A standard optimization solver is utilized to deal with the complexity of the master problem for binary variables. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to solve the subproblem for the continuous variables.

"comparison of new technologies for data exchange in the maritime hf frequency band","2013","Recently, the use of HF radiotelex on ships, as the only terrestrial communication system for data exchange has been kept to a minimum, and the need for alternative systems, which would use the existing HF communication channels to exchange data between ships and end users on land, arose. Satellite communication systems represent the main aid for the exchange of large amounts of data with high transmission rates, but at high costs of equipment and services. Hence, there is the need to explore new, simpler and cheaper technologies for data exchange, which could be an alternative or a substitute for the existing radiotelex system. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the two systems, which could easily replace the existing maritime NBDP (Narrow-Band Direct Printing) telegraphy, has been done.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

"trajectory design for uav-enabled maritime secure communications: a reinforcement learning approach","2022","This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled maritime secure communication network, where the UAV aims to provide the communication service to a legitimate mobile vessel in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In this maritime communication networks (MCNs), it is challenging for the UAV to determine its trajectory on the ocean, since it cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, the trajectory should be pre-designed before the UAV takes off. Furthermore, the take-off location of the UAV and the sea lane of the vessel may be random, which leads to a highly dynamic environment. To address these issues, we propose two reinforcement learning schemes, Q-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, to solve the discrete and continuous UAV trajectory design problem, respectively. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed reinforcement learning schemes versus the existing schemes in the literature.

"multi-hop wireless transmission for maritime scenarios","2023","The collection and processing of maritime information is an essential task that demands extensive analysis to achieve a more profound understanding of coastal regions. Usually, data is gathered through sensors placed on buoys and transmitted to onshore data centres for storage and examination. Nevertheless, the harsh marine environment, including waves, wind, and vessel traffic, creates substantial challenges for effectively managing this task. This paper focuses on two key objectives: firstly, introducing a physical model for electromagnetic propagation in a buoy network that takes into account the unique characteristics of the marine environment, and secondly, evaluating the performance of the physical model in a multi-hop data transmission scenario using a LoRaWAN mesh network. The main aim of the proposed approach is to facilitate efficient communication while optimising the utilisation of reconfigurable devices to reduce power consumption and accelerate data transmission. To gauge the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we explored a multi-hop approach centred on a single relay node that receives packets from other nodes and forwards them to the gateway.

However, due to lack of infrastructure such as optical fibers and base stations, maritime communications inevitably face a highly complex and heterogeneous environment, which greatly challenges the connection reliability and traffic steering efficiency for future service-oriented maritime IoT. With the recent burgeoning application of artificial intelligence (AI) in many fields, an AI-empowered autonomous network for maritime IoT is envisioned as a promising solution. However, AI typically involves training/learning processes, which require realistic data/environment in order to obtain valuable outcomes. To this end, this article proposes the parallel network, which can be regarded as the 'digital twin' of the real network and is responsible for realizing four key functionalities: self-learning and optimizing, state inference and network cognition, event prediction and anomaly detection, and knowledge database and snapshots.

"securing iot based maritime transportation system through entropy-based dual-stack machine learning framework","2023","Internet of Things (IoTs) is envisaged to widely capture the realm of logistics and transportation services in future. The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named â€œDual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)â€ has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs). The proposed S2ML technique outperforms prevalent ones with 1.5% better results compared to asserted approaches on distribution of normal/attack traffic.

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"
"cognitive mimo sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","2009","Robust detection of various hostile threats is vital to protect Navy ships and other facilities within harbor and maritime environments. Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) sonar transmits single acoustic waveform by single projector, which has a few disadvantages including low target detection probability, low resolution, vulnerability of interception by the enemy, sensitivity to jamming, etc. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), typically applied to communications and radar solutions, is an emerging technology that can be applied to sonar to overcome many of the SISO sonar disadvantages. In this paper, cognitive monostatic/bistatic/multistatic MIMO sonar approaches are proposed. MIMO sonar transmits different orthogonal acoustic waveforms from multiple projectors with different spatial distributions. Through space-time-waveform diversity, MIMO sonar is able to apply coherent processing techniques over the received signals, and acquires more diversity gains.

"a performance comparison of routing protocols for maritime wireless mesh networks","2008","We envisage coverage extension of the high bit rate terrestrial communication networks to the ships to reduce the cost in maritime communications. The coverage extension is achieved by forming a mobile wireless mesh network amongst neighboring ships, marine beacons and buoys. The wireless mesh network will be connected to the terrestrial networks across multiple hops via land stations at shore. In such a multi-hop wireless network, routing protocol is important. This paper compares the performance of three existing routing protocols in a maritime communication environment. The three routing protocols are OLSR, AODV and AOMDV. The performance comparison is done via simulation. In the simulation, the wireless mesh network is formed using WiMAX mesh MAC protocol. Also, the random sea surface movement and maritime communication link characteristic are simulated. From the simulation results, we found that OLSR is not as efficient as AODV and AOMDV. Also, compared to AODV, the performance of AOMDV is less affected by sea condition.","WiMAX mesh MAC protocol,Costs,Wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,Mobile communication,routing protocols,Routing protocols,maritime wireless mesh network,Communication networks,ad-hoc ondemand multipath protocol distance vector routing protocol,Media Access Protocol,terrestrial communication network,mobile radio,multihop wireless network,Spread spectrum communication,Bit rate,marine communication,WiMAX,mobile wireless mesh network,optimized link state routing protocol,"
"quality of service provisions for maritime communications based on cellular networks","2017","Considering the increase of communication requirements from marine users, more studies try to introduce terrestrial wireless communication techniques into maritime communications to improve communication qualities. However, different communication scenarios introduce challenges for the application of terrestrial techniques to maritime networks. Furthermore, the communication coverage requirement is much larger than that of terrestrial networks, while the quality of service (QoS) requirement of marine users is expected to be like that on land, which makes network design more complicated. To address these problems, a user-centric communication architecture based on distributed antennas is proposed for maritime communications. The scenario of coastal networks based on cellular techniques is modeled mathematically, based on which the performance of such a network is analyzed and closed-form expressions of network performance are presented. To guarantee the QoS requirements of users, an antenna selection scheme is proposed, which can form a virtual service cloud for a targeted user. In addition, the precondition of the antenna selection scheme is discussed. Simulation results verify the analyses and indicate that the proposed scheme can guarantee the QoS of marine users under different cases.","fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks,Antennas,quality of service requirement,network design,coastal networks,distributed antenna (DA),quality of service,Marine vehicles,Sea measurements,antenna selection scheme,marine users,communication coverage requirement,QoS requirement,communication qualities,Quality of service,communication scenarios,closed-form expressions,maritime networks,cloud computing,cellular radio,antenna selection,Fading channels,Computer architecture,Cellular networks,network performance,mobile antennas,cellular networks,marine communication,cellular techniques,user-centric communication architecture,virtual service cloud,Quality of service (QoS) provisions,user-centric,maritime communications,"
"an enhanced dv-hop positioning scheme based on spring model and reliable beacon node set","2022","How to get the node position, as a hotter topic in the field of wireless communication, is the primary problem to be solved in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The DV-Hop positioning scheme is a kind of range-free positioning scheme, which has been favored by researchers in recent years. However, the original DV-Hop scheme faces the shortcoming of low positioning precision and stability. To ameliorate the positioning capability of the DV-Hop, an enhanced DV-Hop scheme based on the spring model and reliable beacon node set has been presented in this paper. Firstly, the relationship between nodes in the network is abstracted as a spring model, and the distance between unknown nodes and beacon nodes is corrected by comprehensively considering the influence of each beacon node from the physical phenomenon of force vector decomposition. After that, based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, the reliable beacon nodes with smaller distance deviation to the unknown node are picked out to compute the unknown node coordinates, rather than all beacon nodes participating in the calculation. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on distance accuracy and positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed positioning scheme outperforms better than original DV-Hop and other existing improved schemes under different scenarios.","Positioning accuracy,RANSAC algorithm,Distance precision,DV-Hop scheme,WSN,"
"miniature power divider on artificial transmission lines in modern maritime communications","2021","From a General point of view, let's consider a miniature power divider. The use of artificial transmission lines for marine applications allows you to reduce the overall dimensions and obtain a layout with reproducible dimensions. Models of a conventional and compact coupler with a Central frequency of 0.9 GHz were obtained. The area of the compact is 77.5% less than the area of a conventional power divider. The resulting device can be used in various systems where small dimensions are required.","power dividers,reproducible dimensions,Microwave devices,Couplers,Power dividers,microwave metamaterials,artificial transmission lines,Learning (artificial intelligence),frequency 0.9 GHz,artificial line,UHF couplers,coupler,miniature power divider,modern maritime communications,Power transmission lines,compact,compact coupler,small dimensions,quarter-wave segment,marine communication,Layout,Microwave communication,"
"increasing reliable coverage for maritime communications","2019","This paper addresses the flat sea fading effect for maritime communications by proposing different frequency bands. The reception of the wireless signal above water compounds of the reflected signal components from the sea surface and the signal of the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission. The phase difference between both similar propagation paths results in a constructive or destructive signal summation at the receiver. The outcome results at larger distances in extensive areas where the flat fading channel dominates with a reduced path loss if correctly adapted.","line-of-sight transmission,flat sea fading effect,wireless signal,phase difference,marine communication,maritime communications,reflected signal components,water compounds,similar propagation paths results,constructive signal summation,flat fading channel,reliable coverage,sea surface,radiowave propagation,destructive signal summation,outcome results,fading channels,"
"distributed adaptive time slot allocation for wimax based maritime wireless mesh networks","2009","We envisage extending radio coverage of the existing terrestrial wireless broadband networks to the sea to provide ships with cost-efficient high-speed connection to the Internet. This is achieved by forming a WiMAX based maritime wireless mesh network where ships are network nodes connected to the land station across multiple hops. In such a maritime wireless mesh network, time slot allocation is an important issue as it affects the performance in terms of throughout and delay. This papers proposes a distributed adaptive time slot allocation (DATSA) scheme for WiMAX mesh MAC protocol. DATSA is a distributed scheme that allocates time slots robustly by taking into consideration difference between radio reception range and interference range, and latency in scheduling control messages. DATSA has a method to monitor reception quality of an allocated time slot, in order to detect the effect of topology changes due to ship mobility, etc. Based on the monitoring outcome, the method adaptively changes the time slot allocation if necessary. We have evaluated DATSA through random event simulation using QualNet. The simulation results confirm that DATSA outperforms the original WiMAX mesh MAC protocol that has no adaptive time slot allocation, in terms of throughput, average packet delay, and packet delivery ratio.","WiMAX mesh MAC protocol,terrestrial wireless broadband network,Robust control,Wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,distributed adaptive time slot allocation,radio reception range,IP networks,interference range,maritime wireless mesh network,ship mobility,access protocols,telecommunication network topology,Delay effects,Media Access Protocol,Broadband communication,radiofrequency interference,broadband networks,radio reception,marine communication,WiMAX,Interference,Internet,WiMax,"
