"maritime anomaly detection in a real-world scenario: ever given grounding in the suez canal","2022","In this paper we present how automatic maritime anomaly detection tools can be successfully applied in real-world situations such as the major event of the container vessel Ever Given, which grounded in the Suez Canal on March 23rd 2021. The anomaly detector is designed to process the available sequence of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports, information from ground-based or satellite radar systems if available, and contextual information defining the expected nominal behavior of navigation. A statistical hypothesis testing procedure is sequentially run to decide whether or not a deviation from the nominal behavior happened within a specific time period, for instance two consecutive data points. We show, based on the recorded AIS data from the Ever Given, that the proposed detector could have been triggered and alerted to anomalous behavior fully 19 minutes before the grounding.","anomaly detector,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,Grounding,statistical hypothesis testing,Ever Given grounding,automatic maritime anomaly detection tools,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,Testing,ships,Containers,automatic identification system,radar,maritime surveillance,satellite radar systems,contextual information,container vessel,Suez Canal,Artificial intelligence,ground-based system,marine engineering computing,Maritime anomaly detection,Irrigation,statistical hypothesis testing procedure,expected nominal behavior,AIS data,"

"generating bunkering statistics from ais data: a machine learning approach","2021","In shipping, the optimization of the bunkering location is dependent on price, deviation from the planned route and the cost of delays incurred by the bunkering operation itself. Despite their potential importance, detailed statistics for bunkering operations at the individual port call level (e.g. waiting times, barge capacity, location - anchorage or terminal) are not available. I develop a new method, based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, that can a) identify tanker vessels used as bunkering tankers, b) detect stationary ocean-going vessels at anchorage or alongside terminals and c) automatically recognize bunkering operations as a rendezvous between an ocean-going vessel and a bunkering barge. I find that the high time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm in this setting can be compensated by adjusting the algorithm to distributed computer settings. In the empirical study, I use the output to describe the relative importance of Mediterranean ports for bunkering and provide statistics on waiting and servicing times. The empirical findings are important for the optimization of the bunkering location decision in shipping and studies on regional port competitiveness.","Bunkering operations,Bunkering statistics,DBSCAN,Machine learning,Spatial recognition,"
"data augmentation method of object detection for deep learning in maritime image","2020","Maritime object detection is an essential element for the situational awareness in autonomous ships. Recently, as the deep learning technology evolves, the attempt that the ship recognize the surrounding environment by using deep learning technology is gradually increasing. Deep learning methods, however, require a lot of data, but lack a publicly available dataset for object detection in the maritime domain. In this paper, we proposed a data augmentation method that can automatically extend the object detection dataset in maritime image. Extract the mask of the foreground object and combine it with the new background to automatically generate the location information and data of the object.

"estimation of dipole magnetic moment orientation based on magnetic signature waveform analysis by a magnetic sensor","2020","In this paper, we propose a measurement procedure to estimate the magnetic moment orientation (MMO) of a dipole. Theoretical analysis indicates that magnetic field in each orthogonal direction Bi (i = x, y, z) is found to be a superposition of its three basic elements Bij (i = x, y, z and j = 1, 2, 3) along certain direction, allowing the obtained dipole signature to be decomposed of 9 basic elements. An orthogonal energy ratio (OER) algorithm is used to infer the MMO by calculating the signal energy distribution along each axis. A standard OER database is developed which provides a reference to be compared with the measured OER. The one having the smallest variance is determined as the estimated MMO. Owing to space symmetric property, it generally introduces 8 possible solutions. Then, a mathematic method is presented to define the common characteristics of the magnetic signature in the 8 octants, which is able to identify the octant of unknown target based on detected Bi field. As a result, the unique MMO can be estimated. The experimental results show good estimation accuracy for the dipole orientation with average error of 3.5°. In particular, the algorithm is independent of changing CPA and velocity, which is demonstrated in simulation and experiment.","Magnetic moment,Magnetic anomaly signature,Estimation,"
"application of scanning laser doppler vibrometry for delamination detection in composite structures","2017","In this paper application of scanning laser Doppler vibrometry for delamination detection in composite structures was presented. Delamination detection was based on a guided wave propagation method. In this papers results from numerical and experimental research were presented. In the case of numerical research, the Spectral Element Method (SEM) was utilized, in which a mesh was composed of 3D spectral elements. SEM model included also a piezoelectric transducer. In the experimental research guided waves were excited using the piezoelectric transducer whereas the sensing process was conducted using scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV). Analysis of guided wave propagation and its interaction with delamination was based on a full wavefield approach. Attention was focused on interactions of guided waves with delamination manifested by A0 mode reflection, A0 mode entrapment, and S0/A0 mode conversion. Delamination was simulated by a teflon insert located between plies of composite material. Results of interaction with symmetrically and nonsymmetrical placed delamination (in respect to the composite sample thickness) were presented. Moreover, the authors investigated different size of delaminations. Damage detection was based on a new signal processing algorithm proposed by the authors. In this approach the weighted RMS was utilized selectively. It means that the summation in RMS formula was performed only for a specially selected time instances. Results for simple composite panels, panel with honeycomb core, and real stiffened composite panel from the aircraft were presented.","Mode conversion,Scanning laser Doppler vibrometry,Guided waves,Delamination detection,SLDV,Composite materials,"
"infrared small maritime target detection based on integrated target saliency measure","2021","Robust and effective detection of a small target in an infrared maritime image is a key technology of maritime target search and tracking applications. Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to the factors such as dim small targets and various complex backgrounds caused by sun glitters and strong waves. In this article, the integrated target saliency measure (ITSM) based on local and nonlocal spatial information is proposed to improve target detection performance. We combine local heterogeneity property of targets and nonlocal self-correlation property of background with targets' sparsity to separate real targets from background clutters. First, local heterogeneity calculation based on cross-window standard deviation (CSD) is proposed to extract candidate targets preliminarily, which enhances the local intensity difference between small targets and neighboring background. Meanwhile, low-rank representation (LRR) is applied to background prediction and removal, which is followed by adaptive threshold segmentation to enhance target saliency. Finally, we integrate the results obtained from the two steps mentioned above to further enhance targets and suppress background clutters. Then, real targets are extracted by an iterative threshold on the integrated map so as to generate the seed map, in addition, the target expansion strategy is exploited to keep full target areas. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and target detection accuracy.","CSD,target detection,cross-window standard deviation,LRR,Feature extraction,Infrared maritime image,infrared maritime image,background clutter suppression,low-rank representation (LRR),low-rank representation,Standards,marine engineering,maritime target search,integrated target saliency measure,object detection,local heterogeneity property,Sparse matrices,small target detection,infrared small maritime target detection,Large Hadron Collider,correlation methods,infrared imaging,local heterogeneity,integrated saliency,Clutter,Object detection,background prediction,Task analysis,image segmentation,nonlocal spatial information,"
"exploiting doppler in bernoulli track-before-detect for a scanning maritime radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small targets in sea clutter using high-resolution radar is a challenging problem. Recently, a Bernoulli track-before-detect (TBD) filter has been developed for an airborne scanning radar in the maritime domain, with the purpose of detection and tracking of short-exposure targets by using a fast scanning mode (i.e., short dwell-time and noncoherent integration). This article investigates the potential benefits of coherent radar processing and exploitation of Doppler information in TBD, when the radar operates in a slower scanning mode (i.e., using longer dwell times). For this purpose, a new Bernoulli TBD filter is developed, which is capable of processing full three-dimensional (range-azimuth-Doppler) radar data. The amplitude of sea clutter is modeled using the K distribution with Doppler-dependent shape and scale parameters. Numerical results indicate that the new Bernoulli TBD outperforms the fast scanning TBD filter, at signal-to-interference ratios below 6 dB.","airborne radar,Doppler information,full three-dimensional radar data,scanning maritime radar,airborne scanning radar,marine radar,radar detection,radar clutter,track-before-detect,short-exposure targets,sea clutter,fast scanning mode,Bernoulli TBD filter,fast scanning TBD filter,target tracking,coherent radar processing,range-azimuth-Doppler,filtering theory,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Doppler effect,slower scanning mode,Radar,Doppler,radar tracking,Azimuth,Doppler radar,Radar imaging,high-resolution radar,scale parameters,Bernoulli track-before-detect filter,dwell-time,maritime radar,"

"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection. Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model. In this paper, we propose a framework of maritime traffic pattern extraction from vessel AIS information, which learns a traffic pattern using an unsupervised technique, and can be applied on historical Automatic Identification System data. AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique. The proposed framework takes advantage of AIS data, which is a type of the spatiotemporal data that consists of vessel motion information, to perform the experiment. The result shows that the unsupervised framework converts useful information from raw AIS data to effective traffic pattern. The proposed method strongly supports the further research on maritime traffic pattern extraction of AIS data.

"behaviour analysis and anomaly detection algorithms for the maritime integrated surveillance awareness","2019","The increasing complexity of social-economical activities in the maritime domain is raising new challenges to maritime administrations and agencies from coastal states. These challenges require innovative approaches to support maritime safety and security and, in particular, to promote the sustainable use of the oceans. One solution is to enhance Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) using systems with high integration and efficient analysis capability. With this problem in mind, the European Commission awarded a grant to a project which aims to develop a framework that will enable a better decision process, by the operators and decision makers, at the maritime operations centers and allowing seamless cooperation between operating authorities and on-site/at sea/in air intervention forces. The project focuses on taking benefits from the data exchange to the next level, while remaining completely integrated in the current European policy. Securing shipping and human lives is of fundamental importance for our continued well-being.

"multifrequency rf-measurements and characterisation of propagation conditions in the maritime boundary layer","2016","In the maritime boundary layer, air-sea interaction processes have an important impact on radar propagation. The radar range performance near the sea surface depends on meteorological and sea surface conditions. Strong gradients of humidity and temperature close to the air-water interface are most often the reason for propagation effects such as ducting. For ship borne radars the evaporation duct is the dominant propagation mechanism affecting the maximum detection range. Ducting can also increase sea clutter return within and beyond the geometric horizon. Duct characteristics (duct heights, duct structures, duct formation behavior, duct existence, duct vertical and horizontal variability) depend on climatic zones and regional peculiarities. In this contribution we report on a RF propagation experiment performed in the North Sea close to the Island of Sylt.

"research on detection mechanism of vessel abnormal behavior based on immune genetic spectral clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime transport accounts for over 90% of global trade, and maritime safety has been confirmed as a vital issue of maritime transport. Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate, it facilitates the intelligent and automatic management of vessels by the VTS system.","Immune genetic,Abnormal behavior detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Spectral clustering,Duplicato-degree measurement,Intelligent vessel supervision,"

"automatic fault detection system for mining conveyor using distributed acoustic sensor","2022","Condition monitoring of mining conveyor is a highly essential task to ensure minimum disruption to the mining operational system. Failure of one or more conveyor components can result in significant operational downtime, economic loss, and safety risks. The current monitoring method still involves subjective measure from maintenance engineers, where at some cases, fault can be left undetected and leads into site incident. Therefore, there is a high demand for real-time condition monitoring technology to detect early fault on conveyor. In this study, the effective application of distributed optical fibre sensor (DOFS) was explored for long distance real-time condition monitoring of mining conveyor. The fault detection framework was developed by integrating and modifying the Isolation Forest algorithm to analyse optical signals for effective detection of defective idlers. Further, the optical signal was analysed to extract the damage progression of defective idler with time and space. The results were used to classify various levels of damage and to set appropriate damage thresholds. Also, software interface, that can be used to set the sensing parameters, to collect, analyse, and visualise the signal in real-time, was developed. Finally, the developed condition monitoring system was used to monitor a 1.6 km long section of a conveyor structure in Western Australia for a period of 10 months.

"high fidelity digital twin-based anomaly detection and localization for smart water grid operation management","2023","Smart Water Grid (SWG) plays a critical role in sustaining cities economic and social development, but challenges remain in fully realizing the benefits of SWG. While Digital twin (DT) has been discussed in some literature for possible SWG applications, there has been limited, or no technical framework developed to facilitate SWG operation and management. In this paper, a generic framework is developed for constructing SWG high fidelity Digital Twin (DT) by integrating digital thread with various digital models for visualization, data-driven analysis, physics-based simulations, and decision-making support. Both the physics-based models and data-driven models are trained/retrained and calibrated/re-calibrated respectively by using the data collected with the sensors installed throughout a SWG. The information derived from the SWG DT can be diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive to significantly augment users’ intelligence for improving SWG operation and management. One important application of digital twin augmented intelligence is illustrated to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. The solution is tested on the selected areas in Singapore to construct the ever-green DT by calibrating and recalibrating the models for near real-time SWG operation management. The case study was conducted for three supply zones with the total pipeline length of more than 1000 km and 40 weeks of monitoring data, collected by 89 pressure monitoring stations and 8 flow meters at inlets and boundary. More than 3300 data-driven models are trained for optimizing the model performance to achieve accuracy of greater than 80% F1 score for detecting anomaly events, which are subsequently localized within 400 m with 2–3 days lead time.","Data analytics,Anomaly localization,Smart water grid,Anomaly detection,Machine learning,Digital twin,"

"radiative effects of reduced aerosol emissions during the covid-19 pandemic and the future recovery","2021","The pandemic in 2020 caused an abrupt change in the emission of anthropogenic aerosols and their precursors. We estimate the associated change in the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere and the surface. To that end, we perform new simulations with the CMIP6 global climate model EC-Earth3. The simulations use the here newly created data for the anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated effect on clouds from the simple plumes parameterization (MACv2-SP), based on revised SO2 and NH3 emission scenarios. Our results highlight the small impact of the pandemic on the global aerosol radiative forcing in 2020 compared to the CMIP6 scenario SSP2-4.5 of the order of +0.04Wm−2, which is small compared to the natural year-to-year variability in the radiation budget. Natural variability also limits the ability to detect a meaningful regional difference in the anthropogenic aerosol radiative effects. We identify the best chances to find a significant change in radiation at the surface during cloud-free conditions for regions that were strongly polluted in the past years. The post-pandemic recovery scenarios indicate a spread in the aerosol forcing of −0.68 to −0.38Wm−2 for 2050 relative to the pre-industrial, which translates to a difference of +0.05 to −0.25Wm−2 compared to the 2050 baseline from SSP2-4.5. This spread falls within the present-day uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing and the CMIP6 spread in aerosol forcing at the end of the 21st century. We release the new MACv2-SP data for studies on the climate response to the pandemic and the recovery scenarios. Our 2050 forcing estimates suggest that sustained aerosol emission reductions during the post-pandemic recovery cause a stronger climate response than in 2020, i.e., there is a delayed influence of the pandemic on climate.","Radiative forcing,Scenarios,CovidMIP,COVID-19 pandemic,CMIP6,Anthropogenic aerosols,"

To ensure this, it is necessary to have more than just a camera capturing visible light, so a thermal infrared capturing camera and a hyperspectral sensor are also used. The classification results derived onboard are sent to a ground station by radio downlink. An operator in the command and control facility is then able to use this georeferenced semantic information to decide on the next steps.","aerial camera,radio downlink,MACS,remote sensing,hydrological techniques,MACS-Mar,real-time capable multisensor remote sensing system,hyperspectral,Cameras,real-time,Monitoring,modular airborne camera system,hyperspectral sensor,thermal infrared capturing camera,thermal infrared,data fusion,maritime security,Water pollution,hyperspectral imaging,Optical sensors,wireless sensor networks,maritime applications,Real-time systems,marine telemetry,infrared imaging,Hyperspectral sensors,sensor head constellation,image sensors,hydrological equipment,maritime environment operation,"
"a maritime spectrum sensing scheme based on ad hoc network and non-uniform quantization","2018","Radio communication, one of the key components in maritime communication system, has drawn much more attention because of the increasing number of maritime navigation. In this work, an efficient spectrum sensing strategy based on Ad Hoc network is proposed to improve the robustness and accuracy of maritime radio communication. At first, the network nodes (for example, ships) will be divided into different sub networks according to Ad Hoc network protocol. In the second stage, the mathematical detection probability model of spectrum sensing is constructed. Subsequently, cooperative spectrum sensing combined with non-uniform quantization scheme is given. Simulations have been carried out to illustrate the high detection probability with high robustness of the proposed spectrum sensing scheme. Therefore, it is feasible and advantageous to apply the presented spectrum sensing scheme for improving the accuracy and stability of the maritime radio communication.","Ad Hoc network of ships,maritime spectrum,radio spectrum management,spectrum sensing scheme,maritime navigation,Ad Hoc network protocol,ad hoc networks,cooperative spectrum sensing,mathematical detection probability model,non-uniform quantization,efficient spectrum sensing strategy,maritime communication system,signal detection,probability,marine communication,maritime radio communication,nonuniform quantization scheme,detection probability optimization,high detection probability,"
"optical discrimination of emulsified oil in optically complex estuarine waters","2022","Coastal estuaries, characterized by highly varying waters with complex optical properties, pose challenges for effective oil discrimination via optical remote sensing. In this study, an object-based spectra comparison (OBSC) approach was proposed to extract emulsified oil slicks from Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia, using optical imagery from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and PlanetScope. The OBSC approach utilizes the spectral signatures of oil emulsion to develop emulsified oil index and normalized emulsified oil index to identify potentially emulsified oil objects from MSI and PlanetScope, respectively. Reflectance spectra of the potential objects were compared with those from dynamically-selected nearby waters to rule out false-positive detections, accounting for the varying water optical properties in the estuary. This OBSC approach performed well in extracting emulsified oil slicks from optical images. Moreover, multiple sensor capabilities for oil detection were compared, and requirements for detection and discrimination of oil spills in the coastal estuary environment were further discussed.","Oil emulsion,Oil spill,Estuary,Optical remote sensing,"
"spatio-temporal outlier detection algorithms based on computing behavioral outlierness factor","2019","A major task in spatio-temporal outlier detection is to identify objects that exhibit abnormal behavior either spatially, and/or temporally. There have only been a few algorithms proposed for detecting spatial and/or temporal outliers. One example is the Local Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (LDBSCAN). Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is mainly for clustering; it just tells us whether an object belongs to a cluster or it is an outlier. A measure known as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) gives a quantitative measure of outlierness to each object, where a high LOF score means it is potentially an outlier. LDBSCAN algorithm, which combines the above notions, considers only the spatial context. Furthermore, the notion of a cluster is defeated (i.e. LDBSCAN may report clusters having less than the minimum required points in a cluster), and some of the outliers may not be detected because of the limitation of the existing conditions in the LDBSCAN algorithm. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, namely Spatio-Temporal Behavioral Density-based Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-BDBCAN) and Approx-ST-BDBCAN. ST-BDBCAN algorithm adopts the proposed, new concept, called Spatio-Temporal Behavioral Outlier Factor (ST-BOF), which is a spatio-temporal extension to LOF. It also uses both spatial and temporal attributes simultaneously to define the context. By doing so, the relative importance of spatial continuity or temporal continuity appropriate to the application at hand can be established. The Approx-ST-BDBCAN algorithm achieves improved scalability, with minimal loss of detection accuracy by partitioning data points for parallel processing. Experimental results on synthetic, and buoy datasets suggest that our proposed algorithms are accurate and computationally efficient. Additionally, new Outlier Association with Hurricane Intensity Index (OAHII) measures are introduced for quantitative evaluation of the results from buoy dataset.","Spatio-temporal outliers,Hurricane,Algorithms,Efficiency,Cluster,Behavioral outlierness factor,"
"toward the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs for the maritime domain","2021","International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts, but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of, and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding promising results.","Semantics,Pipelines,data mining,criminal networks,physical sensors,Maritime DeepDive,Information Extraction,data fusion,natural language processing,physical movement,Maritime,maritime piracy incidents,maritime threats,probabilistic knowledge graphs,hard data,marine safety,international maritime crime,Probabilistic logic,maritime domain,Knowledge Graph,Prototypes,graph theory,uncertainty handling,Robustness,marine engineering computing,criminal law,Relation Extraction,inference mechanisms,knowledge extraction,Uncertainty,Sensors,learning (artificial intelligence),natural language data,DeepDive,probabilistic event extraction,"

"artinali++: multi-dimensional specification mining for complex cyber-physical system security","2021","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) have been investigated as a key area of research since they are the core of Internet of Things. CPSs integrate computing and communication with control and monitoring of entities in the physical world. Due to the tight coupling of cyber and physical domains, and to the possible catastrophic consequences of the malicious attacks on critical infrastructures, security is one of the key concerns. However, the exponential growth of IoT has led to deployment of CPSes without support for enforcing important security properties. Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to be effective for securing these systems. Mining the specifications of CPSes by experts is a cumbersome and error-prone task. Therefore, it is essential to dynamically monitor the CPS to learn its common behaviors and formulate specifications for detecting malicious bugs and security attacks. Existing solutions for specification mining only combine data and events, but not time. However, time is a semantic property in CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for obtaining high accuracy. This paper proposes ARTINALI++, which dynamically mines specifications in CPS systems with arbitrary size and complexity. ARTINALI++ captures the security properties by incorporating time as a substantial property of the system, and generate a multi-dimensional model for the general CPS systems. Moreover, it enhances the model through discovering invariants that represent the physical motions and distinct operational modes in complex CPS systems. We build Intrusion Detection Systems based on ARTINALI++ for three CPSes with various levels of complexity including smart meter, smart artificial pancreas and unmanned aerial vehicle, and measure their detection accuracy. We find that the ARTINALI++ significantly reduces the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 23.45% and 73.6% on average, respectively, over other dynamic specification mining tools on the three CPS platforms.","Cyber-Physical Systems,Safety,Specification mining,Intrusion Detection Systems,Program analysis,Security,"

"operational estimates of areal evapotranspiration and their significance to the science and practice of hydrology","1983","Reliable estimates of areal evapotranspiration are essential to significant improvements in the science and practice of hydrology. Direct measurements, such as those provided by lysimeters, eddy flux instrumentation or Bowen-ratio instrumentation, give point values, require constant attendance by skilled personnel and are based on unverified assumptions. A critical review of the methods used for estimating areal evapotranspiration indicates that the conventional conceptual techniques, such as those used in current watershed models, are based on assumptions that are completely divorced from reality; and that causal techniques based on processes and interactions in the soil-plant-atmosphere system are not likely to prove useful for another generation. However, the complementary relationship can do much to fill the gap until such time as causal techniques become practicable because it provides the basis for models that permit areal evapotranspiration to be estimated from its effects on the routine climatological observations needed to estimate potential evapotranspiration. Such models have a realistic conceptual and empirical basis, by-pass the complexity of the soil-plant system and require no local calibration of coefficients. Therefore, they are falsifiable (i.e. can be tested rigorously) so that errors in the associated assumptions and relationships can be detected and corrected by progressive testing over an ever-widening range of environments. Such a methodology uses the entire world as a laboratory and requires that a correction made to obtain agreement between model and river-basin water budget estimates in one environment must be applicable without modification in all other environment. The most recent version of the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration (CRAE) models is formulated and documented. The reliability of the independent operational estimates of areal evapotranspiration is tested with comparable long-term water-budget estimates for 143 river basins in North America, Africa, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The practicality and potential impact of such estimates are demonstrated with examples which show how the availability of such estimates can revitalize the science and practice of hydrology by providing a reliable basis for detailed water-balance studies; for further research on the development of causal models; for hydrological, agricultural and fire hazard forecasts; for detecting the development of errors in hydrometeorological records; for detecting and monitoring the effects of land-use changes; for explaining hydrologic anomalies; and for other better known applications. It is suggested that the collection of the required climatological data by hydrometric agencies could be justified on the grounds that the agencies would gain a technique for quality control and the users would gain by a significant expansion in the information content of the hydrometric data, all at minimal additional expense.",""

"a strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","2012","Derelict fishing gear (DFG) is a highly persistent form of marine pollution known to cause environmental and economic damage. At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","Remote sensing,Marine debris,Derelict fishing gear,"
"neighborhood rough residual networkâ€“based outlier detection method in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Outlier detection can identify anomalies in large-scale data.

We then delete the redundant attributes according to the attribute combination importance derived from the neighborhood combined entropy. The data after attribute reduction are used to train the convolutional neural network, and the residual network (ResNet50) is used to avoid the degradation of model performance caused by the increase in the number of network layers. The proposed method is compared with mainstream outlier detection algorithms on a fishing vessel operation dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of outlier detection while taking into account interpretability and computational efficiency, thereby ensuring the data integrity of IoT-enabled MTSs.","Outlier detection,Data models,residual network,neighborhood combined entropy,Transportation,Entropy,data integrity,Anomaly detection,Behavioral sciences,Marine vehicles,Residual neural networks,IoT-enabled maritime transportation systems,"

The resulting directed graph ultimately leads to the detection and statistical characterization of recurrent maritime traffic patterns.

"censored deep reinforcement patrolling with information criterion for monitoring large water resources using autonomous surface vehicles","2023","Monitoring and patrolling large water resources is a major challenge for nature conservation. The problem of acquiring data of an underlying environment that usually changes within time involves a proper formulation of the information. The use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles equipped with water quality sensor modules can serve as an early-warning system for contamination peak-detection, algae blooms monitoring, or oil-spill scenarios. In addition to information gathering, the vehicle must plan routes that are free of obstacles on non-convex static and dynamics maps. This work proposes a novel framework to obtain a collision-free policy using deterministic knowledge of the environment by means of a censoring operator and noisy networks that addresses the informative path planning with emphasis in temporal patrolling. Using information gain as a measure of the uncertainty reduction over data, it is proposed a Deep Q-Learning algorithm improved by a Q-Censoring mechanism for model-based obstacle avoidance. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for both cases in the Ypacaraí monitorization task. Simulations showed that the use of noisy-networks are a good choice for enhanced exploration, with 3 times less redundancy in the paths with respect to — greedy policy. Previous coverage strategies are also outperformed both in the accuracy of the obtained contamination model by a 13% on average and by a 37% in the detection of dangerous contamination peaks. Finally, the achieved results indicate the appropriateness of the proposed framework for monitoring scenarios with autonomous vehicles.","Deep Reinforcement Learning,Patrolling,Environmental monitoring,Autonomous Surface Vehicles,Information gathering,"

"mining regular behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2016","In the information fusion domain, mining regular behaviors is very important to task classification, anomaly behavior detection, situation assessment and threat estimation. Through clustering multidimensional trajectories which are accumulated in all kinds of electronic information systems, regular behaviors could be mined. Most of the trajectories clustering methods are clustering spatial position closed trajectories to a cluster. They cannot distinguish behaviors whose space position is similar but the moving speed and direction are quite different. Some sub-trajectory clustering methods which presented similarity measures considering segment direction, speed, and angle could solve this problem, but they are not suitable to some application scenarios which should clustering the whole trajectories. In this paper, we proposed a multidimensional trajectory clustering algorithm to mine regular behaviors by considering the attribute, type, position, velocity and course characteristics, and implement it on two experiments. This research is very helpful for mining all the regular behaviors in different application scenarios and would have a wide prospect in expert and intelligent systems.","Hausdorff distance,Multidimensional trajectory,Clustering,Regular behavior,"

"traffic knowledge discovery from ais data","2013","Maritime Situational Awareness (i.e., an effective understanding of activities in and impacting the maritime environment) can be significantly improved by knowledge discovery of maritime traffic patterns. The recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers provides a rich source of cooperative vessel movement information. This vast amount of information can not be fully utilized by human operators and poses new storage and computational challenges. A compact representation of this rapidly increasing amount of information gives operational utility to data which would otherwise be ignored. This paper proposes an unsupervised and incremental learning approach to extract the historical traffic patterns from AIS data. The presented methodology called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD) effectively processes raw AIS data to infer different levels of contextual information, spanning from the identification of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of traffic routes. Furthermore, the accurate understanding of the historical traffic enables the classification and prediction of vessel behaviours as well as the detection of low-likelihood behaviours, or anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide operators with a configurable knowledge framework supporting day by day decision making and general awareness of vessel pattern of life activity.

Ship performance and navigation data of a selected vessel are analyzed, where various data anomalies, i.e. sensor related erroneous data conditions, are identified. Those erroneous data conditions are investigated and several approaches to isolate such situations are also presented by considering appropriate data visualization methods. Then, the cleaned data are used to derive various relationships among ship performance and navigation parameters that have been visualized in this study, appropriately. The results show that the wind profiles along ship routes can be used to evaluate vessel performance and navigation conditions by assuming the respective sea states relate to their wind conditions. Hence, the results are useful to derive appropriate mathematical models that represent ship performance and navigation conditions. Such mathematical models can be used for weather routing type applications (i.e. voyage planning), where the respective weather forecast can be used to derive optimal ship routes to improve vessel performance and reduce fuel consumption.

"material discrimination using scattering and stopping of cosmic ray muons and electrons: differentiating heavier from lighter metals as well as low-atomic weight materials","2015","Reported is a new method to apply cosmic-ray tomography in a manner that can detect and characterize not only dense assemblages of heavy nuclei (like Special Nuclear Materials, SNM) but also assemblages of medium- and light-atomic-mass materials (such as metal parts, conventional explosives, and organic materials). Characterization may enable discrimination between permitted contents in commerce and contraband (explosives, illegal drugs, and the like). Our Multi-Mode Passive Detection System (MMPDS) relies primarily on the muon component of cosmic rays to interrogate Volumes of Interest (VOI). Muons, highly energetic and massive, pass essentially un-scattered through materials of light atomic mass and are only weakly scattered by conventional metals used in industry. Substantial scattering and absorption only occur when muons encounter sufficient thicknesses of heavy elements characteristic of lead and SNM. Electrons are appreciably scattered by light elements and stopped by sufficient thicknesses of materials containing medium-atomic-mass elements (mostly metals). Data include simulations based upon GEANT and measurements in the HMT (Half Muon Tracker) detector in Poway, CA and a package scanner in both Poway and Socorro NM. A key aspect of the present work is development of a useful parameter, designated the “stopping power” of a sample. The low-density regime, comprising organic materials up to aluminum, is characterized using very little scattering but a strong variation in stopping power. The medium-to-high density regime shows a larger variation in scattering than in stopping power. The detection of emitted gamma rays is another useful signature of some materials.","Material properties,Contraband,Radiation length,Homeland security,Cosmic rays,Highly enriched uranium,"

Compared with passive bistatic radar (PBR), the utilization of multiple satellites provides an improvement in MMT detection performance, together with the capabilities of localization and velocity estimation. However, the multiple satellite transmitters cause the differences principally in bistatic range and Doppler centroid (DC) of the MMT. To integrate the PMR echoes, the biggest challenge is the two differences that need to be handled. In the proposed technique, first, the centroid-compensated keystone transform (CCKT) is proposed and applied to each PBR echo. It not only corrects range cell migration (RCM) but also equalizes the DC to the same. Then, the long-time integration is performed on each PBR echo, after which it is integrated into the range-Doppler frequency rate (DFR) domain. Finally, in order to settle the difference in bistatic range, an MMT position and velocity domain (i.e., the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain) is constituted. The obtained multiple range-DFR maps are projected to the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, and then, the effective integration of multistatic echoes can be implemented. The final STHI result allows detecting the MMT reliably. Meanwhile, according to the 3-D position where the MMT is located in the  $X$ â€“ $Y$ â€“ $V$  domain, the MMT can be localized, and its velocity can be estimated simultaneously. In May 2021, we have successfully carried out the worldâ€™s first BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection experiment, and the experimental results are given to prove the effectiveness of this technique.","Satellites,MMT position,range cell migration,marine radar,MMT detection performance,radar detection,passive radar,PBR echo,RCM,transforms,passive bistatic radar,Radio transmitters,STHI processing,BeiDou-based PMR MMT detection technique,space-time hybrid integration processing,satellite navigation,centroid-compensated keystone transform,maritime surveillance,maritime moving target (MMT) detection,object detection,BeiDou-based passive radar,spaceâ€“time hybrid integration (STHI),PMR echoes,bistatic range,Doppler effect,multistatic echoes,Doppler centroid,Satellite broadcasting,range-Doppler frequency rate domain,multiple satellite transmitters,Doppler radar,Passive radar,BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar maritime moving target detection technique,Receivers,spaceborne radar,CCKT,Multistatic radar,passive multistatic radar (PMR),radar cross-sections,range-DFR domain,multiple range-DFR maps,"
"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic. The proposed framework is applicable to the development of pattern-aware collision avoidance systems aimed at improving maritime traffic safety.","maritime conflict detection,real-world ship behavior,Safety,Marine vehicles,ship anti-collision pattern,pattern-aware collision avoidance systems,ship trajectory data,behavior mining,AIS network,ships,marine safety,maritime collision avoidance,Collision avoidance,Artificial intelligence,automatic identification system network,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,anti-collision behavior,International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,collision avoidance,Data mining,maritime anti-collision pattern discovery,"
"sub-bottom profiling for large-scale maritime archaeological survey an experience-based approach","2013","The development of cost-effective management strategies, including mapping of the submerged cultural heritage - potentially extensive even at quite great depths - is becoming ever more important, given increasing commercial activity in marine areas which may cause damage or prevent further investigation of the sea floor. This commercial activity can take the form of aggregate extraction, fishing, installation of facilities such as windmills, cables or pipelines and the construction of bridges, harbours etc.Non-invasive acoustic survey methods play a significant role in the mapping of the submerged cultural heritage. Elements such as archaeological wreck sites exposed on the sea floor are mapped using side-scan and multi-beam techniques. These can also provide information on bathymetric patterns representing potential Stone Age settlements, whereas the detection of such archaeological sites and wrecks partially or wholly embedded in the sea-floor sediments demands the application of highresolution sub-bottom profilers. This paper presents a strategy for the cost-effective large-scale mapping of unknown sedimentembedded sites such as submerged Stone Age settlements or wrecks, based on sub-bottom profiling with chirp systems. The mapping strategy described includes: a) definition of line spacing depending on the target; b) interactive sailing, i.e. when potential archaeological anomalies are located, their character is immediately investigated in more detail by a denser pattern of sub-bottom survey lines; c) on-site interpretation while acquiring data; d) recognition of anomalies not due to geology. Consequently, this strategy differs from those employed in detailed studies of known wreck sites (eg. Plets et al. 2009) and from the way in which geologists map the sea floor and the geological column beneath it. The strategy has been developed on the basis of extensive practical experience gained from the use of an off-the-shelf 2D chirp system and, given the present state of the technology, appears well-suited to large-scale maritime archaeological mapping.","commercial activity,archaeological anomaly,cost-effective management strategy,Stone Age settlements,interactive sailing,seafloor phenomena,Chirp,Sea floor,chirp systems,cables,maritime archaeological survey,fishing,geophysical techniques,subbottom profiling,mapping strategy,strategy,Stone Age,windmills,archaeological sites,survey,cost-effective large-scale mapping,geology,facility installation,subbottom survey lines,pipelines,bathymetric patterns,off-the-shelf 2D chirp system,line spacing,side-scan techniques,chirp,Sediments,submerged cultural heritage,geological column,multibeam techniques,maritime archaeology,bathymetry,Acoustics,history,Geology,noninvasive acoustic survey methods,Boats,predictive modelling,high resolution subbottom profilers,aggregate extraction,archaeological wreck sites,large-scale maritime archaeological mapping,sea-floor sediments,harbours construction,bridge construction,Marine animals,sediment embedded sites,sea floor,marine areas,"

"intake of trace contaminants by corals in abrolhos reef bank (western south atlantic) during two decades of coastal impacts","2023","Abrolhos is the largest and most diverse coral reef system in the South Atlantic. It is home to several endemic coral species and a site of cetaceous reproduction. Like any other reef ecosystem worldwide, it experiences multiple disturbances associated with increasing sea surface temperatures, El Niño events, and, most recently, oil spill pollution. In addition to these global stressors, the Abrolhos region may have been impacted by coastal human interventions, a large-scale mining disaster, floods, and extra-tropical cyclones that affected the region during the last 20 years. Among these stressors, the Fundão dam collapse (the largest in the Southern Hemisphere) deserves special attention since it delivered significant amounts of iron tailings to the nearby coast. To investigate the region's recent history, we collected, dated, and performed detailed geochemical and isotopic analyses on two coral colonies (i.e., Siderastrea stellata and Mussismilia harttii), in order to determine if effects of recent human activity on reef systems (and most recent natural impacts) could be detected thorough bioaccumulation of metals in their skeletons. In this context, we detected an abrupt increase in Fe and Mn concentrations in the coral skeleton, which are among the main constituents of the Fundão dam tailings. We show that a concomitant increase in metal concentrations tracks contaminant dispersion of the Fundão dam tailings released to the western South Atlantic. Besides this event, our data also show that coastal dredging activities in the nearby coral reef site (i.e., at the Tomba channel) and two natural episodes (i.e., the flood of 2013 and the anomalous extra-tropical cyclonic activity in 2008) were also recorded in the coral skeleton based on changes in Rare Earth Elements distribution, Rb and U concentrations.","Doce river,Fundão dam,Coral,Abrolhos,Marine pollution,Sclerochronology,"
"comparison of target detectors to identify icebergs in quad- polarimetric sar alos-2 images","2021","Icebergs represent hazards to ships and maritime activities and therefore their detection is essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD). We use four single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images. The data were calibrated and processed.

"infrared maritime target detection based on iterative corner and edge weights in tensor decomposition","2023","High-precision infrared maritime target detection plays an important role in early warning, monitoring, search, and rescue. The methods of decomposing the original image into low-rank background components and sparse target components show favorable detection performance. However, the strong edge interference is also sparse and may be mistakenly taken as target components, resulting in a large number of false alarms and reducing detection accuracy. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative corner and edge weights method based on tensor decomposition. The original image is decomposed into the background component, target component, and additional strong edge interference component. The corner strength is designed as the weight of the target component, and the edge strength is designed as the weight of the interference component in order to separate the target and interference more accurately. And the two weights are designed to be updated during each iteration of the model solution to reduce the impact of initial imprecise weights on detection results. Compared with 8 advanced baseline methods in 10 datasets, the proposed method demonstrates outstanding results and shows engineering application prospects.","Image edge detection,maritime target detection,iterative corner,edge weights method,background component,edge strength,Solid modeling,edge detection,tensors,interference suppression,detection accuracy reduction,target component,initial imprecise weights,corner strength,false alarms,object detection,Infrared small target detection,low-rank background components,tensor decomposition,iterative weight,sparse target components,Tensors,Iterative methods,Object detection,Interference,favorable detection performance,strong edge interference component,Analytical models,"

"chapter 2 - biosensors and internet of things in smart healthcare applications: challenges and opportunities","2020","The use of health and well-being monitoring technologies has been steadily increasing and such systems can now be found in smart homes, age-friendly workplaces, public spaces, and elsewhere. These monitoring technologies employ a wide variety of off-the-shelf smart sensors and medical devices to support functional, physiological, and behavioral monitoring and to address social interaction aspects of daily life. These systems focus either on specific health-related conditions or on supporting the more general aims of comfort, well-being, and quality of life. However, there remain several technological (interoperability, expandability, etc.) and societal (cost, privacy, etc.) challenges to be addressed before smart biosensor systems are widely adopted. Motivated by the above, this chapter highlights the challenges and opportunities surrounding the application of smart biosensors in healthcare and presents three state of the art solutions for leveraging smart sensors in this context. The first concerns a smart living solution platform that integrates heterogeneous sensors and assistive medical and mobile devices, enabling continuous data collection from the everyday lives of the elderly and data analytics that support personalized interventions. The second presents an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem comprising sensors and smart wearables to improve occupational safety and workforce productivity through personalized recommendations.

The problem is treated as hypothesis testing on the expected value of the distance between trajectories. We relate this quantity to the first and second degree Wasserstein distances between trajectory forecast distributions. These distributions are obtained using integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process models with the trajectory measurements collected so far. Building upon these results, we propose an algorithm which traverses the trajectories observed so far for detecting rendezvous over a rolling time horizon.

"an automated sar-based method for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2023","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active Earth observation system that can obtain high-resolution ocean images all day and all weather. It can be used for monitoring the marine environment, maritime traffic, and oil spills at sea. SAR provides accurate and real-time ocean information, which can ensure water traffic safety and ecological environment. Therefore, it plays an irreplaceable role in maritime surveillance. At present, deep-learning based object detection methods have achieved certain results in the application of ship detection in SAR images. Ship targets in SAR images have strong angular reflection characteristics, causing some parts of them to have large grayscale values, appearing as scattering points. At the same time, the heading of ship usually has a certain angle with the horizontal direction. Traditional deep-learning models do not have sufficient generalization ability for these situations. Horizontal bounding boxes also contain a large amount of background features, which affects the accuracy of the model. In response to these characteristics, first use convolutional neural network to extract ship features; Secondly, generate oriented proposals to reduce the impact of background features; Thirdly, using Canny and Harris to obtain features of ship edges and scattering points as attention mechanisms to enhance bounding box regression and classification; Finally, optimize the loss function, which will consider the influence of angle.

"geospatial analysis of oil discharges observed by the national aerial surveillance program in the canadian pacific ocean","2014","Oil pollution resulting from day to day human maritime activities contributes a high portion of the overall input into marine environments, constituting a major threat to marine ecosystems worldwide. In Canada, the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) extensively monitors and collects information on oily discharges using remote sensing devices. Despite the availability of data from NASP and other surveillance programs internationally, there is a paucity of spatial analyses of oil pollution patterns, particularly in their association with human marine pursuits. The objective of this paper is to analyze the association between observed oily discharges and human maritime activities in the Canadian Pacific Ocean. This study used Poisson regression to spatially model detected oily discharges with marine traffic, coastal facilities and proximity to coast. Further, it developed localized (‘regional’) models to address spatial heterogeneity. The models identify recreational activities, passenger traffic, commercial traffic, fisheries, and proximity to the coast as predictors of observed oily discharges. The regional models yield more accurate and reliable estimates of local associations, and identify more parsimonious sets of predictors for each region. By identifying and accounting for human activities most associated with oily discharge patterns, the models developed in this study could be used to estimate pollution rates in areas with less surveillance, and identify areas where NASP coverage may need to be increased. Spatially explicit rates estimated by these models can be used to monitor the effectiveness of programs and policy aimed at reducing discharge rates of oily pollution. This study can be used as a model approach for extending the analysis to the other coasts of Canada, using available NASP data.","Prediction,Spatial analysis,Oil pollution,Aerial surveillance,Canadian Pacific Ocean,Poisson regression,"
"enhanced winter snowmelt in the antarctic peninsula: automatic snowmelt identification from radar scatterometer","2020","Surface snowmelt affects the energy balance through melt-albedo feedback and may endanger the ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) through hydrofracture. Here, we introduce an automatic snowmelt identification algorithm based on Quick Scatterometer and Advanced Scatterometer. The proposed method can provide self-adaptive thresholds for snowmelt detection based on Rosin thresholding, and is able to detect weak melt signals with a wavelet denoising procedure. Results suggest the AP surface snowmelt has slightly declined during 1999–2018 in the context of recent cooling. However, winter melt index (i.e., melt days times the area of melting) has significantly increased (above the 99% confidence level) with a rate of 83% decade−1. Unprecedented winter snowmelt was found in 2015/2016 when about one-third of the AP experienced snowmelt in late May. This may be attributed to the intrusions of marine air and the enhanced föhn-driven warming resulted from the abnormal northwesterly flow driven by a significant deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low.","Rosin thresholding,Winter snowmelt,Scatterometer,Antarctic Peninsula,Wavelet denoising,"
"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"

"detecting drought events over a region in central europe using a regional and two satellite-based precipitation datasets","2023","In this study, the accuracy of two satellite-based datasets is evaluated. The evaluation includes monthly precipitation estimates, spatial detection of precipitation, and drought monitoring against a regional gridded dataset spanning 2007–2019. A study area covering Poland and parts of the neighboring countries in Central Europe was selected for this evaluation. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at multi-time scales was employed to monitor meteorological (SPI-3), agricultural (SPI-6, SPI-9), and hydrological (SPI-12) droughts over the study region. This study selected PERSIANNCDR as a top-down precipitation dataset and SM2RAIN-ASCAT as a bottom-up dataset. According to the results, both datasets exhibit good accuracy for precipitation estimations, but PERSIANNCDR shows higher accuracy based on the R (coefficient of correlation) and KGE (Kling-Gupta Efficiency) performance indicators. However, SM2RAIN-ASCAT has a lower bias according to PBIAS(%) (percent bias). The reference dataset indicates that the study area experienced dry conditions over 50% of the months. Specifically, based on the reference dataset, 12 (SPI-6) and 16 (SPI-9) severe agricultural droughts were detected. Twenty-four severe agricultural drought events were identified via SPI-6, while the longer SPI window (SPI-9) demonstrated that PERSIANNCDR assessed 20 severe droughts over the study area. SM2RAIN-ASCAT detected 11 severe agricultural droughts via SPI-6 and SPI-9. Furthermore, based on SPI-12, the reference dataset identified 75 hydrological droughts, while the top-down dataset indicated a lower number of hydrological droughts (67 events) than the reference dataset over the studied period. In contrast, the bottom-up dataset detected 84 hydrological droughts. The spatial distribution of severe meteorological droughts showed a clear pattern with predominant occurrence in eastern parts (Vistula River Basin), as shown by the reference dataset, while this pattern changed for agricultural and hydrological droughts (Odra River Basin). Additionally, the results reveal that meteorological drought does not have a similar spatial distribution to agricultural and hydrological droughts.","Rainfall,Baltic Sea,Drought,Satellite products,Climate change,"

"an online background subtraction algorithm deployed on a nao humanoid robot based monitoring system","2016","In this paper, we design a fast background subtraction algorithm and deploy this algorithm on a monitoring system based on NAO humanoid robot. The proposed algorithm detects a contiguous foreground via a contiguously weighted linear regression (CWLR) model. It consists of a background model and a foreground model. The background model is a regression based low rank model. It seeks a low rank background subspace and represents the background as the linear combination of the basis spanning the subspace. The foreground model promotes the contiguity in the foreground detection. It encourages the foreground to be detected as whole regions rather than separated pixels. We formulate the background and foreground model into a contiguously weighted linear regression problem. This problem can be solved efficiently via an alternating optimization approach which includes continuous and discrete variables. Given an image sequence, we use the first few frames to incrementally initialize the background subspace, and we determine the background and foreground in the following frames in an online scheme using the proposed CWLR model, with the background subspace continuously updated using the detected background information. The proposed algorithm is implemented by Python on a NAO humanoid robot based monitoring system. This system consists of a control station and a Nao robot. The Nao robot acts as a mobile probe. It captures image sequence and sends it to the control station. The control station serves as a control terminal. It sends commands to control the behavior of Nao robot, and it processes the image data sent by Nao. This system can be used for living environment monitoring and form the basis for many vision-based applications like fall detection and scene understanding.

"a bernoulli track-before-detect filter for interacting targets in maritime radar","2021","This article is devoted to the problem of multitarget tracking in the maritime environment using Bernoulli track-before-detect (TBD) filtering. Detection and tracking of weak targets in sea clutter using high-resolution airborne radar is notoriously challenging compared to classical target tracking problems.

"maritime weather prediction using fuzzy logic in java sea","2011","Fuzzy logic has mostly been used in different kind of field either in taking decision, or control system and forecasting. Fuzzy logic is one that can represent a complex situation into a simple form in a language that is easily caught by humans. Similarly, to represent the nature of weather easily understood by ordinary people, this is the result of weather forecasting based on meteorological data. Some of the statistical methods used for weather forecasting are Auto Regressive (AR), Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and found some shortcomings of these traditional method. That is the need for historical data is not small, low-prediction accuracy results in a complex condition.

"intelligent deep fusion network for anomaly identification in maritime transportation systems","2023","This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture for identifying outliers in the context of intelligent transportation systems. The use of a convolutional neural network with decomposition is explored to find abnormal behavior in maritime data. The set of maritime data is first decomposed into similar clusters containing homogeneous data, and then a convolutional neural network is used for each data cluster. Different models are trained (one per cluster), and each model is learned from highly correlated data. Finally, the results of the models are merged using a simple but efficient fusion strategy.

"fault diagnosis for induction generator-based wind turbine using ensemble deep learning techniques","2022","Fault diagnosis in induction machines (IM) require effective detection at early stages to prevent permanent machine failure. This requires fast sensing of disturbances as well as efficient diagnosis methods. Conventional signal measuring techniques are usually intrusive, sensitive, with a low signal-to-noise ratio, and may show limited performance at incipient fault stages. Moreover, traditional machine learning (ML) diagnosis techniques based on handcrafted feature extraction methods suffer from limitations that can be overcome by deep learning (DL) with automatic feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, an online, non-intrusive method is proposed for fault diagnosis in a three-phase IM based on infrared imaging. The proposed method integrates three convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL models (Inception, Xception, and MobileNet) to identify IM health status, fault types, and stator Inter-turn faults (ITF) location and severity. Deep features obtained from these CNNs are merged through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) resulting in spatial-time-frequency features. This fusion reduces the input features’ size and improves diagnostic accuracy. Merged features’ length is further reduced using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where these reduced features are then used for classification. Compared to DL-based diagnosis methods introduced in previous work, the proposed method shows superior performance. First, it uses the IR images directly without the need for clustering and segmentation steps, thus saving time and effort. Moreover, ensembled DL is applied via combining the three CNNs benefits altogether rather than applying an individual DL method. Finally, unlike the huge features’ number exhibited by previous studies, the proposed approach uses minimal features, thus reducing classification complexity and time while maintaining 100% classification accuracy.","Renewable energy generating,Wind energy​ sources,Ensemble deep learning,Classification,Infrared thermal imaging,Fault diagnosis,Wind turbine inter-turn faults,Condition monitoring,"

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"surveillance in maritime scenario using deep learning and swarm intelligence","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have played a crucial role in supporting Search and Rescue (SAR) Operations due to their fast movement capabilities and flexibility. During a search and rescue operation scenario, the time constraint is a crucial parameter, so the required time to detect humans in distress with precision is also a vital part. Modern Deep learning algorithms like CNN also aid in these missions. However, most models and datasets available focus on search and rescue missions on the ground or land. UAV-based search and rescue operations in the Maritime Scenario remain a challenge. This study focused on using deep learning algorithms such as CNN to precisely detect a human in peril with a swarm of drones. At the same time, we emphasize using swarm intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO) to effectively find a victim in the shortest time by exploring a massive area. The distinctiveness of this system is that it combines the model with the best accuracy to detect and the best swarm intelligence algorithm for finding targets in the quickest time possible, thus enhancing the surveillance mission. In this research, among VGG16, ResNet50V2, InceptionV3, Xception, and MobileNetV2 models, VGG16 produced an IoU (Intersection over Union) score of 0.62 with a Class Label accuracy of 99.15% and Bounding Box accuracy of 88.74% in CNN part.

"identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the viirs nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","2018","Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","Nightfire product,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),Object-oriented analysis,Identification,Industrial heat sources,Time-series,"

"predicting spatial kelp abundance in shallow coastal waters using the acoustic ground discrimination system roxann","2014","Kelp forests represent a major habitat type in coastal waters worldwide and their structure and distribution is predicted to change due to global warming. Despite their ecological and economical importance, there is still a lack of reliable spatial information on their abundance and distribution. In recent years, various hydroacoustic mapping techniques for sublittoral environments evolved. However, in turbid coastal waters, such as off the island of Helgoland (Germany, North Sea), the kelp vegetation is present in shallow water depths normally excluded from hydroacoustic surveys. In this study, single beam survey data consisting of the two seafloor parameters roughness and hardness were obtained with RoxAnn from water depth between 2 and 18 m. Our primary aim was to reliably detect the kelp forest habitat with different densities and distinguish it from other vegetated zones. Five habitat classes were identified using underwater-video and were applied for classification of acoustic signatures. Subsequently, spatial prediction maps were produced via two classification approaches: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and manual classification routine (MC). LDA was able to distinguish dense kelp forest from other habitats (i.e. mixed seaweed vegetation, sand, and barren bedrock), but no variances in kelp density. In contrast, MC also provided information on medium dense kelp distribution which is characterized by intermediate roughness and hardness values evoked by reduced kelp abundances. The prediction maps reach accordance levels of 62% (LDA) and 68% (MC). The presence of vegetation (kelp and mixed seaweed vegetation) was determined with higher prediction abilities of 75% (LDA) and 76% (MC). Since the different habitat classes reveal acoustic signatures that strongly overlap, the manual classification method was more appropriate for separating different kelp forest densities and low-lying vegetation. It became evident that the occurrence of kelp in this area is not simply linked to water depth. Moreover, this study shows that the two seafloor parameters collected with RoxAnn are suitable indicators for the discrimination of different densely vegetated seafloor habitats in shallow environments.","seafloor mapping,underwater habitats,macroalgae forests,hydroacoustics,Helgoland,"
"target reflectivity and rcs interactions in integrated maritime surveillance systems based on surface-wave high-frequency radars","2001","Abnormal fluctuations have been observed in detected power levels of some of the targets during trials of the integrated maritime surveillance system (IMS) based on the Canadian east coast surface-wave high-frequency radar (HFSWR). The power level of most of the surface and air targets fluctuated within measurement-error limits (a few dB) during consecutive detections. These fluctuations have been observed to be more than 15 dB for a huge oil platform and nearby large tankers. These fluctuations are quite different than those observed in microwave radars, such as pulse-to-pulse or scan-to-scan fluctuations (which are modeled as different Swerling-type targets), and as are mentioned in most of the classical radar handbooks. In order to understand the reason behind these fluctuations, the behavior of the target reflectivity and radar cross section (RCS) of surface and air targets and their mutual RCS interaction were investigated. Powerful numerical techniques were used to model and understand the target reflectivity and RCS interactions, mostly in the resonance regime. Different scenarios were created, and the mutual RCS behavior of nearby large targets (such as oil tankers and/or fixed offshore oil platforms) as they were maneuvering were modeled. It was shown that 10 dB to 20 dB RCS fluctuations should be expected when targets interact, especially in the resonance regime.","marine radar,oil platform,radar detection,radar applications,surface-wave high-frequency radar,RCS interactions,maneuvering targets,Radar cross section,Petroleum,electromagnetic wave reflection,measurement-error limits,Radar scattering,surface electromagnetic waves,radar target detection,Offshore installations,oil tanker,surface-wave HF radar,Sea surface,search radar,air targets,detected power levels,Radar clutter,Fluctuations,Canadian east coast,target reflectivity,radar cross section,integrated maritime surveillance systems,surface targets,resonance regime,Surveillance,radar cross-sections,Reflectivity,Radar detection,"
"system architecture for real-time condition monitoring and anomaly detection on ships","2023","Sea-based rescue organizations play a vital role in maritime civil security by resolving offshore emergencies, securing sea routes, and monitoring critical naval infrastructure. However, increasing marine traffic makes rescue operations more difficult, demanding better organization and orchestration of available resources.

"distributed situational awareness for maritime autonomous surface ships in mixed waterborne transport: an ontology-based framework","2023","The safety of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) in mixed waterborne transport system (MWTS) depends on effective situational awareness (SA) distribution among MASS, manned ships, and various stakeholders, such as Vessel Traffic Service (VTS), Remote Control Center (RCC) and Fairway Shipping Agency. This paper focuses on the research question: How can situational awareness be effectively distributed among these entities in mixed waterborne transport? The research objective is to develop a distributed situational awareness framework that unifies SA among these stakeholders, ensuring safe navigation and compatibility with users of different roles. To achieve this objective, the proposed framework incorporates three key concepts: individual SA, authority-based SA, and distributed SA. Individual SA, previously introduced in our study, is responsible for each shipâ€™s SA, while authority-based SA accounts for the SA of human operators supervising the waterborne transport system, such as VTS operators and fairway agency personnel. Distributed SA generates guiding messages for ships based on the situational awareness from both individual SA and authority-based SA, thereby enabling regulation-based and traffic control-based recommendations for waterborne transport (e.g., ship speed and course adjustments). The research methodology employs ontology-based modelling to implement the framework, constructing a domain knowledge network. A case study is conducted as an essential part of the research methodology, presenting how the framework perform the situational awareness from different aspects and inconsistency detection among manned ships, MASS, VTS operators, and so on. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is utilized to detect inconsistencies and generate guidance messages for ships. Through these cases, we demonstrate how the proposed Ontology-based framework can reconcile inconsistencies between individual and authority-based SA, leading to a safer and more effective waterborne transport.","Traffic control,Stakeholders,Semantic Web,situation reconciling,Transportation,mixed waterborne transport system,Regulation,Safety,Personnel,ontology,Distributed situational awareness,"
"gis-enabled maritime awareness system (gmas)","2009","Being aware of maritime activities is important for homeland security. We have worked with the US Coast Guard to develop a waterway visual surveillance system on Elba Island, in Savannah, GA for maritime awareness. With the system, we developed an enhanced temporal difference algorithm based on active zone (ETD-AZ) to detect waterway moving objects, including container ships, commercial vessels, small vessels, sailboats, tugboats, and dolphins, etc. In the algorithm, active zone is first defined to model the imaging locations of moving objects that appear in the waterway; the model reduces noises caused by winds, clouds, and waves in the near-view fields. A thresholded difference map is computed by using temporal difference and thresholding methods. The thresholded difference map is further processed by applying morphological operations to remove noises. A final decision rule is derived to decide whether an image contains moving objects or not based on motion pixels in thresholded difference map and in the difference map after morphological operation.

"the lama system: a “smart” magnetometer network for harbour protection","2022","This work describes the development of an underwater anti-intrusion system based on a magnetometer self-informed network, whose purpose is to detect the presence of threats in the proximity of critical infrastructures (e.g, terrorist divers in harbours). In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders. The paper presents experimental results obtained during the method validation tests, when intruders were moving in the surrounding undersea environment.","Environmental magnetism,Marine geophysics,Time series analysis,Magnetic anomaly detection,Underwater magnetic systems,Harbour protection,"
"upper mississippi pb as a mid-1800s chronostratigraphic marker in sediments from seasonally anoxic lakes in eastern canada","2013","Sediment cores from eight headwater lakes located in Southern Québec, Eastern Canada, were analyzed for Pb, stable Pb isotopes, and the radioelements 210Pb, 137Cs, 241Am and 226Ra. The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century 210Pb-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000km from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate 210Pb chronologies in environmental archives from Eastern North America.",""
"detecting infrared maritime targets overwhelmed in sun glitters by antijitter spatiotemporal saliency","2019","When detecting infrared maritime targets on sunny days, strong sun glitters can lower the detection accuracy tremendously. To this problem, we proposed a robust antijitter spatiotemporal saliency generation with parallel binarization (ASSGPB) method. Its main contribution is to facilitate to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in this situation. The ASSGPB algorithm exploits the target's spatial saliency and temporal consistency to separate real targets from clutter areas. The ASSGPB first corrects image intensity distribution with a central inhibition difference of Gaussian filter. Then, a self-defined spatiotemporal saliency map (STSM) generator is used to generate an STSM in five consecutive frames while compensating interframe jitters by a joint block matching. Finally, a parallel binarization method is adopted to segment real targets in STSM while keeping full target areas.

"visual analytics for the detection of anomalous maritime behavior","2008","The surveillance of large sea areas often generates huge amounts of multidimensional data. Exploring, analyzing and finding anomalous behavior within this data is a complex task. Confident decisions upon the abnormality of a particular vessel behavior require a certain level of situation awareness that may be difficult to achieve when the operator is overloaded by the available information. Based on a visual analytics process model, we present a novel system that supports the acquisition of situation awareness and the involvement of the user in the anomaly detection process using two layers of interactive visualizations. The system uses an interactive data mining module that supports the insertion of the user's knowledge and experience in the creation, validation and continuous update of the normal model of the environment.","surveillance,visual analytics process model,data mining,vessel behavior,situation awareness,anomaly detection,visual analytics,data visualisation,interactive systems,security of data,interaction,interactive data mining module,large sea area,multidimensional data,marine engineering,engineering computing,interactive visualization,visualization,anomalous maritime traffic behavior detection,"
"gwvt: a gpu maritime vessel tracker based on the wisard weightless neural network","2017","Maritime surveillance systems increase the security of ports and ships. The video tracking is an important and challenging component of a surveillance system. Difficulties can arise due to weather conditions, target trajectory and appearance, occlusions, lighting conditions and noise. The tracker locates the vessel frame by frame in real time. This paper proposes the GPU WiSARD Vessel Tracker GWVT, a maritime vessel tracker that uses the WiSARD weightless neural network and implemented on a GPU. The GPU parallel processing feature allows the tracking algorithm to be executed very fast. CUDA easy the implementation of the parallel WiSARD tracker because the network discriminators fit well in the thread and block layout. The implementation of a WiSARD based vessel tracker on a GPU is innovative on literature.

A modified threshold method was used to detect multiple melt events and the main melt event was identified by the longest melt duration or the largest melt intensity. Algorithm validation was performed with a Circum-Arctic network of station measurements extracted from the Global Surface Summary of Day product maintained by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Estimates of melt onset date corresponded to a clear shift in the statistical distribution of mean daily air temperatures from largely below freezing to above freezing. Melt was not detected in 7% of the cases mainly over dense boreal forest cover, or very shallow tundra snow cover. QSCAT- derived melt end dates were significantly correlated with station-derived snow-off estimates (r2 = 0.79; RMSE = 11.6 days). The difference between the two estimates was within one week for 70% of the cases so there is good potential to use QSCAT-derived melt end dates to approximate snow-off dates across the pan-Arctic region. There was a tendency for QSCAT-derived snow-off dates to be biased early over dense forest regions due to a diminished backscatter melt signature.","Pan-Arctic,Snowmelt,Onset/end,QuikSCAT,"

The utilization of K- and KA-distributed clutter models in place of the simpler Rayleigh distribution was examined through analysis of simulated and real data.

However, the quantity of data, the complexity of situations, the failure to take into account their spatial characteristics and the potential for the same scenario to be interpreted in different ways have proved to be significant problems.

We analyze the utilization of deep learning techniques and therefore evaluate two state-of-the-art object detection approaches for their applicability in the maritime domain: Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. To train the Mask R-CNN including the instance segmentation branch, a novel algorithm for automated generation of instance segmentation labels is introduced.

"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"

"towards improved monitoring of offshore carbon storage: a real-world field experiment detecting a controlled sub-seafloor co2 release","2021","Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key technology to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial processes in a feasible, substantial, and timely manner. For geological CO2 storage to be safe, reliable, and accepted by society, robust strategies for CO2 leakage detection, quantification and management are crucial. The STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine Carbon Capture and Storage) project aimed to provide techniques and understanding to enable and inform cost-effective monitoring of CCS sites in the marine environment. A controlled CO2 release experiment was carried out in the central North Sea, designed to mimic an unintended emission of CO2 from a subsurface CO2 storage site to the seafloor. A total of 675 kg of CO2 were released into the shallow sediments (∼3 m below seafloor), at flow rates between 6 and 143 kg/d. A combination of novel techniques, adapted versions of existing techniques, and well-proven standard techniques were used to detect, characterise and quantify gaseous and dissolved CO2 in the sediments and the overlying seawater. This paper provides an overview of this ambitious field experiment. We describe the preparatory work prior to the release experiment, the experimental layout and procedures, the methods tested, and summarise the main results and the lessons learnt.","Offshore carbon storage,Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS),Marine field experiment,detection and quantification,CO leakage,Monitoring,Attribution,"
"characterization of forest fire and saharan desert dust aerosols over south-western europe using a multi-wavelength raman lidar and sun-photometer","2021","In the morning of 21 July 2019, a dense forest fire smoke plume was detected over Évora (Portugal) in the lower troposphere. Around 13:00 UTC, a Sahara dust layer was detected by lidar between 3000 and 4000 m height above sea level. In this work results of these events using an EARLINET Raman lidar and AERONET Sun-photometer measurements are reported and discussed: the dense smoke layer, the mixing of smoke with dust and the lofted dust layer that crossed Évora. During the morning, in-situ hourly mean black carbon concentration reached a maximum of 6.28 ± 0.73 μgm−3. The AERONET fine mode aerosol optical depth at 500 nm reached 0.77 and the Ångström exponent at 440–870 nm varied between 1.45 and 1.82, indicating the presence of fine smoke particles in the atmospheric column. In the beginning of the afternoon, the lidar profiles indicated the presence of a smoke layer followed by two thin layers of pollution mixed with dust and a lofted dust layer. The smoke particles caused low particle linear depolarization ratios at 532 nm with mean value of 0.059 ± 0.002 in the smoke layer. In contrast, the lofted dust layer caused mean particle linear depolarization ratio at 532 nm of 0.26 ± 0.01. Mass concentrations were in the order of 22–29 μg m−3 in the smoke layer and 60–178 μg m−3 in the lofted dust layer. During the afternoon and at night, mixing dust layers were identified by using lidar data. In the afternoon, two aerosol layers exhibited mean particle linear depolarization ratios at 532 nm of 0.23 ± 0.01 and 0.25 ± 0.01 with the dust dominating the extinction and mass concentration in both aerosol layers. Mass concentrations of dust were in the order of 101–266 μg m−3 and 159–195 μg m−3. At night, the particle linear depolarization ratio presented low variability across the identified layer with mean value of 0.20 ± 0.01. The Ångström exponents were low, the mean lidar ratios were 50 ± 6 sr (355 nm) and 42 ± 4 sr (532 nm) and the aerosol optical depth was 0.32 (355 nm) and 0.30 (532 nm).

"chapter 7 - preventing system intrusions","2013","Intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion detection and attempting to stop detected possible incidents. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) focus primarily on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators. In addition, organizations use IPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events, and produce reports. Many IPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack's content. This chapter describes the characteristics of IPS technologies and provides recommendations for designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining them. The types of IPS technologies are differentiated primarily by the types of events that they monitor and the ways in which they are deployed.","Crackers,Malware,Daemons,Cybersecurity,Intrusion prevention systems,TCP/IP,Hacker and digital attacks,Cybercrime,Phishing,"
"variability in acoustic backscatter and fish school abundance at a shallow water ccs site","2023","Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one approach used to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere. Subsea CO2 storage sites must have low risk of leakage and have minimal impact on the marine environment. Single beam echosounders (SBES) are a good technology for detecting CO2 leakage in the water column for application in a marine Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MM&V) framework. Characterisation of active acoustic data is needed to determine whether levels of water column backscatter enable CO2 gas leaks to be detected, and to understand acoustic false positives caused by naturally occurring acoustic signals (e.g., fish schools). We used acoustic data collected by SBES fitted to two mobile and two fixed sensor platforms over four years to characterise the site of the proposed CarbonNet CCS Project subsurface CO2 storage reservoir. We observed diel and seasonal variability in water column backscatter and fish school abundance. Water column backscatter was highest at night and in Austral summer and autumn periods but was at a level that would allow small CO2 gas leaks to be detected. Fish abundance was highest during the day and in Austral summer and autumn. To reduce the likelihood of acoustic false positives, surveys designed to detect CO2 gas leaks using active acoustic technologies could prioritise data collection at night and during the months where fish school abundance is lowest. Understanding these sources of natural variability can guide survey strategies and response actions.","Shallow coastal seas,CO,CCS,Single beam echosounders (SBES),Measurement monitoring and verification (MM&V),Marine environment,Active-acoustics,"

"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"
"dynamic detection of water surface area of ebinur lake using multi-source satellite data (landsat and sentinel-1a) and its responses to changing environment","2019","In arid and semi-arid climatic areas, lakes are extremely essential for fragile ecological environment and regional sustainable development. Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake becomes a representative ecological degradation region in northwestern China. The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of inter-month dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data. The dynamic thresholds of classification were selected using Otsu method and the results showed that the classification results were acceptable with the optimal overall accuracy of 99.94% and kappa coefficient of 0.9971, respectively. We conduct a time series analysis of surface areas of Ebinur Lake using S1A data from February 9th, 2017 to February 4th, 2018.

We then theoretically analyze the behavior of participants in the proposed system. In particular, we model the cheating decisions of a platform as chance-constrained programming and develop a Monte Carlo simulation method based on exploited optimality properties to solve it. Numerical experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the system reduces platforms’ motivation to cheat to an acceptable level.

The resulting time series have been further analyzed to provide a climatology for sea-ice and polynya characteristics. The ice regime of the Laptev Sea is characterized by a large seasonal and interannual variability, the latter occurring exclusively in summer. By using a consistent sea-ice data record, we can document negative trends in all the areas studied for the 24-year period, Due to the large interannual variability the trends are not significant. For the entire Laptev Sea the decreases in sea-ice extent and area on a yearly average basis reveal −1.5% decade−1 and −1.7% decade−1, respectively. In summer and early fall large losses in sea-ice cover of up to 7% decade−1 are evident in regional sectors of the Laptev Sea. In addition, an increase in polynya activity in late winter and early spring, a significant shift towards earlier snowmelt onset, and an increase of open-water area in early fall indicating an extension of the length of the summer melt period, has been observed. A brief overview of climate and sea-ice research in the Siberian Arctic is presented. According to observational data and numerical experiments there is still a large degree of uncertainty about the role of dynamic and thermodynamic factors and possible feedback mechanisms in the atmosphere–ice–ocean system, which are responsible for the large interannual variability and the retreat of sea-ice coverage as observed in the 1990s. Summer sea-ice anomalies likely result from synoptic-scale processes superimposed by the large-scale atmospheric circulation during summer and to a lesser extent from preconditioning processes in winter and spring.","thermodynamic sea-ice model,remote sensing,polynyas,cyclone detection and tracking,sea ice,Laptev Sea,Arctic,"

The key parameter of simplified HOSVD is determined by the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index, which contributes to reduce the computation complexity of the proposed method. Finally, we improved the deep learning network to detect the targets in various behaviors after the clutter suppression. In order to address the issue of limited clutter data, transfer learning based on historical radar echo data is applied. A thorough experimental analysis on various real clutter data shows that the proposed method performs competitively. Our method shows a superior performance over many state-of-the-art clutter suppression methods, with a covered target detection accuracy of 92.4% under strong spread clutter background.","Ionosphere,structural similarity (SSIM) index,higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD),ionosphere clutter suppression,Tensors,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,Doppler effect,target detection,high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR),Reflection,"
"maritime moving target localization using passive gnss-based multistatic radar","2018","This paper examines the potential in extracting the instantaneous location of maritime moving targets using a passive multistatic radar with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as illuminators of opportunity and a single receiver. This paper presents a theoretical framework for the localization of a moving target from a set of bistatic range measurements. The algorithm and its predicted accuracy are presented. The localization is achieved by what is essentially a multilateration technique, which can be applied while the transmitting platform is also in motion. The algorithms and the accuracy predictions, as a function of the number of transmitters, have been experimentally confirmed via a dedicated experimental campaign, where two different maritime targets were detected by up to 12 GNSS satellites belonging to different satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo) simultaneously. To the best of the author's knowledge, these are the first results of their kind and on this scale not only for GNSS-based passive radar but also for multistatic radar in general.","Satellites,multistatic radar,Passive radar,passive multistatic radar,multilateration technique,passive GNSS-based multistatic radar,Receivers,bistatic range measurements,Multistatic radar,target tracking,Spaceborne radar,Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based radar,maritime moving target localization,passive radar,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,satellite navigation,target localization,Global navigation satellite system,"

"unambiguous imaging for moving targets in maritime scenarios with dual receive channel mode of gf-3 satellite","2019","Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor that can operate in the dual receive channel (DRC) mode. Different from the traditional single-channel SAR system, the multichannel SAR system can overcome the inherent limitation to achieve high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) at the same time. However, the key challenge it faces is false target suppression. Especially for the moving vessels on the ocean, the existence of false targets will increase false alarm probability and affect the interpretation of SAR images. In this paper, the method of integration of detection, velocity estimation, location, and imaging for moving targets in the HRWS SAR system is proposed as well as applied to get an unambiguous image. The simulation and GF-3 real data experimental results show the validity of the method.","marine radar,moving targets,image resolution,SAR images,unambiguous imaging,geophysical image processing,maritime scenarios,unambiguous image,multichannel SAR system,moving vessels,GF-3 Satellite,Unambiguous imaging,false targets,object detection,false alarm probability,synthetic aperture radar,Chinese multichannel synthetic aperture radar sensor,Dual Receive Channel Mode,radar imaging,dual receive channel mode,radar receivers,wide-swath,probability,HRWS SAR system,traditional single-channel SAR system,gaofen-3,inherent limitation,remote sensing by radar,false target suppression,oceanographic techniques,"
"background modeling in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2020","The estimation of the sea background from maritime infrared video sequences is necessary for target detection. It is challenging to obtain an accurate background model when the scene is a complex and fluctuating sea surface. However, the amplitude spectrum sequences at each frequency point of the pure seawater frames in the Fourier domain are more stable than the gray value sequences of each pixel in the spatial domain. Thus, the background is modeled with a Gaussian distribution in the Fourier domain with the mean and variance adapted over time. In addition, the sea background dynamics are introduced by the variance of the amplitude spectrum sequence, and the dynamic Gaussian discriminant coefficient is set up for each frequency point. Two target discrimination flags are presented based on the background dynamics and Gaussian discriminant process to extract the target more accurately. Furthermore, the entropy filter in the Fourier domain is designed to enhance the target and suppress the sea clutter. The proposed method is successfully tested over several maritime infrared video sequences and has better detection effects compared with several existing state-of-the-art methods.","Fourier transforms,maritime infrared video sequences,entropy,fluctuating sea surface,Background model,sea background dynamics,seawater,sea clutter,spatial domain,dynamic Gaussian discriminant coefficient,target discrimination flags,Biological system modeling,background modeling,object detection,Entropy,Correlation,amplitude spectrum sequence,entropy filter,Adaptation models,image filtering,accurate background model,clutter,infrared imaging,image sequences,gray value sequences,complex sea surface,Gaussian discriminant process,Object detection,frequency point,Gaussian distribution,Heuristic algorithms,Fourier domain,pure seawater frames,maritime infrared target detection,"
"real-time infrared horizon detection in maritime and land environments based on hyper-laplace filter and convolutional neural network","2023","The infrared (IR) horizon is an essential reference for near-ground state awareness and target detection. The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. Notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s. Besides, our algorithm also shows strong robustness even under harsh sea conditions and urban backgrounds.

"continuous monitoring of land disturbance based on landsat time series","2020","We developed a new algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45° to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or “breaks”) contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%.","Landsat,Time series,COLD,Change detection,Near real-time,Land disturbance,"
"operational active fire mapping and burnt area identification applicable to mexican nature protection areas using modis and noaa-avhrr direct readout data","2009","Since 1999, the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (CONABIO) in Mexico has been developing and managing the “Operational program for the detection of hot-spots using remote sensing techniques”. This program uses images from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-AVHRR), which are operationally received through the Direct Readout station (DR) at CONABIO. This allows the near-real time monitoring of fire events in Mexico and Central America. In addition to the detection of active fires, the location of hot spots are classified with respect to vegetation types, accessibility, and risk to Nature Protection Areas (NPA). Besides the fast detection of fires, further analysis is necessary due to the considerable effects of forest fires on biodiversity and human life. This fire impact assessment is crucial to support the needs of resource managers and policy makers for adequate fire recovery and restoration actions. CONABIO attempts to meet these requirements, providing post-fire assessment products as part of the management system in particular for satellite-based burnt area mapping. This paper provides an overview of the main components of the operational system and will present an outlook to future activities and system improvements, especially the development of a burnt area product. A special focus will also be placed on the fire occurrence within NPAs of Mexico.","Direct readout,Active fire mapping,Burnt area,NOAA-AVHRR,Mexico,Nature protection area,MODIS,"
"technical program","2016","In this paper we present an application of sensorbased anomaly detection in maritime transport. The study is based on real sensor data streamed from a ship to shore, where the data is analysed through a big data analytics platform. The novelty of this work originates in the use of data from sensors covering different aspects of the ship operation, exemplified here by propulsion power, speed over ground and ship motion in four different degrees of freedom. The developed method employs Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) for signal reconstruction, and the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) technique for anomaly detection, where different hypothesis tests looking both at mean and variance deviations have been tested. In order to compare different settings, formal state of the art performance metrics have been used. We demonstrate that the AAKR model produces good reconstructions when the observations are similar to observations represented in the training data, and for some examples of simulated anomalies, the method reveals the abnormal behaviour. As long as the parameters are tuned carefully, alarms are triggered appropriately by the SPRT.",""
"reduced rank hybrid target detectors for maritime environments","2022","In airborne radar, reduced rank adaptive techniques are employed when non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the clutter causes insufficient sample support. Approaches to combat this problem include the single data set algorithms and reduced-rank detectors such as those employing the principal components, cross-spectral metric and the multistage Wiener filter (MWF). This latter approach is superior to other reduced rank techniques in terms of computational efficiency, sample support and rank requirements. Hybrid detectors that combine the traditional and single data set detectors have been shown to work effectively in homogeneous environments while maintaining their robustness to heterogeneous clutter. In this paper we combine the hybrid detection approaches with the MWF to develop hybrid reduced rank algorithms that are capable of bringing the improved performance of the hybrid framework to bear on the low sample support environments. We evaluate the proposed detectors using simulated sea clutter data, showing detection performance that is superior to conventional and other hybrid detectors in low sample support spiky clutter environments while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous clutter.","airborne radar,marine radar,reduced rank techniques,single data,radar detection,radar clutter,hybrid detectors,homogeneous clutter,sea clutter data,MWF,low sample support environments,hybrid reduced rank algorithms,multistage Wiener filter,heterogeneous clutter,reduced-rank detectors,homogeneous environments,maritime environments,rank requirements,hybrid detection approaches,reduced rank hybrid target detectors,low sample support spiky clutter environments,reduced rank adaptive techniques,Wiener filters,"
"on the morphological long-term development of dumped material in a low-energetic environment close to the german baltic coast","2009","The development of the bed bathymetry of an experimental dumping area was followed over three-and-a-half years by means of multibeam echosounder techniques. Two types of material were discharged in the bight of Mecklenburg in the Baltic Sea in approximately 20 m of water depth. One set of the discharges was 2900 m3 of glacial till and the other set was a 2400 m3 mixture of glacial till, sand and minor amounts of cohesive matter. Only approximately 2500 m3 (86%) of the glacial till and 1500 m3 (63%) of the mixed soil materials were deposited on the seabed. This means that already during the dumping process a considerable part of the sediment material drifted away. The glacial till formed crater-like rings of 30 m diameter with peaks up to 1.4 m above seabed, whereas the spatial structure of the mixed soil material was somewhat more diffuse, but with similar magnitudes in the peaks and troughs. The morphological changes were small and their quantification required a high measuring precision in the order of few cm in the vertical. The dominant processes of surface deformation was flattening of peaks and filling of troughs. The speed of this process decreased with horizontal scale: structures of less than 4 m horizontal extension had a trend to disappear within less than five years, whereas structures of larger than 8 m extension showed little change and are estimated to remain detectable for many decades. In contrast to the reworking of the matter inside the dumping structures, no net transport of material out of the dumping area could be detected. Extrapolating the observed morphological changes into the future it is estimated that without significant decrease in internal shear strength of the disposed till the structures will persist for at least 70 years. This can be attributed to the high internal stability of the dumped glacial till and the low hydrodynamic forces present at the seabed in this region.","Material dumping,Coastal morphology,Baltic coast,Germany,Sediment dynamics,Multibeam echosounder,"

We chose a statistical approach to robustly segment given detections using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG). This is the fundament for subsequent feature analysis and 3-stage-classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with separation of clutter and man-made objects in first, non-ships and ships in second, and different ship structure types in third stage.

"“mystify”: a proactive moving-target defense for a resilient sdn controller in software defined cps","2022","The recent devastating mission Cyber–Physical System (CPS) attacks, failures, and the desperate need to scale and to dynamically adapt to changes, revolutionized traditional CPS to what we name as Software Defined CPS (SD-CPS). SD-CPS embraces the concept of Software Defined (SD) everything where CPS infrastructure is more elastic, dynamically adaptable and online-programmable. However, in SD-CPS, the threat became more immanent, as the long-been physically-protected assets are now programmatically accessible to cyber attackers. In SD-CPSs, a network failure hinders the entire functionality of the system. In this paper, we present MystifY, a spatiotemporal runtime diversification for Moving-Target Defense (MTD) to secure the SD-CPS infrastructure. In this paper, we relied on Smart Grid networks as crucial SD-CPS application to evaluate our presented solution. MystifY’s MTD relies on a set of pillars to ensure the SDN controller resiliency against failures and attacks. The 1st pillar is a grid-aware algorithm that optimally allocates the most suitable controller–deployment​ location in large-scale grids. The 2nd pillar is a special diversifier that dynamically relocates the controller between heterogeneously configured hosts to avoid host-based attacks. The 3rd pillar is a temporal diversifier that dynamically detours controller–workload between multiple controllers to enhance their reliability and to detect and avoid controller intrusions. Our experimental results showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the presented approach.","Network security,Smart grid,CPP,MTD,SDN,CPC,"

"chapter 13 - spatiotemporal variability of snowmelt onset across svalbard inferred from scatterometer data (2000–2017)","2021","Significant changes in the interannual variation of Arctic snow and sea ice are connected to changes in the global climate. Retreat of ice sheets/glaciers is due to increased melting in many regions of the cryosphere. Active microwave sensors are frequently used to detect surface melting because of their sensitivity to the liquid water presence in snow/ice. We mapped the annual melt duration and summer melt onset for the Svalbard archipelago using microwave scatterometers flown on QuikSCAT, OSCAT, ASCAT, and OSCAT-2, providing one of the longest continuous records of radar backscatter to estimate snowmelt onset and melt duration on Svalbard spanning 2000–17. A single threshold-based model was used to detect the timing of snowmelt; the threshold was calculated using meteorological data from manned weather stations. The results capture the timing and extent of melt events caused by warm air temperature and precipitation, as a consequence of the influx of moist, mild air from the Norwegian and Barents seas. The highest melt duration and earlier melt onset occurred in southernmost and western Svalbard, in response to the influence of the warm West Spitsbergen Current. Compared to earlier studies, we found considerable interannual variability and regional differences. Though the record is short, there is an indication of an increasing trend in total days of melt duration and earlier summer melt onset date, possibly linked to the general warming trend. Climate indices such as Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation are well correlated with onset melt and duration across Svalbard. With the reported year-after-year decrease in sea ice cover over the Arctic Ocean, the trend toward longer snowmelt duration inferred from this study is expected to enhance the Arctic amplification.","Snowmelt onset,Svalbard,microwave scatterometer,climate indices,backscatter,"
"ten years of monitoring air quality and ecological integrity using field-identifiable lichens at kejimkujik national park and national historic site in nova scotia, canada","2017","Arboreal lichens have a wide range of tolerance to habitat disturbance. As a result, they have been used globally as bioindicators of environmental change, particularly for monitoring atmospheric pollution. Here, we use lichens to monitor air quality and ecological integrity (EI) at Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site in Nova Scotia, Canada. We provide descriptions of two protocols and compare the results using data gathered in 2006, 2011, and 2016. To monitor air quality, we established 12 monitoring sites throughout the park and used a suite of lichens that are intolerant to air pollution to develop an index of air purity (IAP) that we compared every 5 years. Our protocol for monitoring EI of forest ecosystems was set up at these same 12 sites. We selected 50 regionally common field-identifiable lichen species and genera ranging in sensitivity from disturbance-tolerant to intolerant, and compare their presence in spatially constrained zones on a variety of tree species every 5 years. Our results suggest that air quality in Kejimkujik has increased slightly in the 10 years since monitoring was implemented, which is consistent with improvements in local air quality. Species richness also increased slightly, suggesting that EI has not declined. The maintenance of EI, through protection and restoration of natural resources, is a key priority in the management of national parks in Canada. Our protocols will provide early detection of changes to EI, enabling park managers to take responsive action. We are confident that our protocols can be replicated in other parts of the world with different suites of regionally common lichens.","Sustainable forest management,Index of air purity,Maritimes,Acadian forest,Bio-monitoring,"
"recognition of maritime objects based on flir images using the method of eigenimages","2018","The paper presents the method of recognition of marine objects based on their images taken by infrared sensors (FLIR - forward looking infrared) using the method of eigenimages analysis. This method is based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method that allows to reduce the dimensionality of the problem of image recognition. The paper presents a method of maritime objects recognition based on FLIR images consisting of the following stages: pre-processing of images from the pattern database, calculation of coordinates of images from the pattern database in a new reduced feature space, calculation of coordinates of image cluster centers, pre-processing of a new image, calculation of coordinates of a new image in the reduced feature space, calculation of the distances of the recognized image from all the image cluster centers in the pattern database and making a decision on choosing the most similar maritime object, or stating that there is no image satisfying the similarity condition in the pattern database. The combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) method with the method of eigenimages analysis reduces the dimensionality of the recognition problem. The original dimension is equal to the number of pixels in each image. It must be equal for all the images from pattern database and the image being recognized. The final value of the problem dimension is equal to the number of image clusters in the pattern database. In some situations, the dimensionality of the problem can be reduced due to the low eigenvalues of the matrix of Karhunen-Loeve transformation.

"abnormal situations interpretation in industry 4.0 using stream reasoning","2019","With the coming era of Industry 4.0, more assets and machines in plants are equipped with sensors which collect big amount of data for effective on-line equipment condition monitoring. Monitoring equipment conditions can not only reduce unplanned downtime by early detection of relevant situations like anomalies but also avoid unnecessary routine maintenance. For the detection of these situations it is necessary to integrate distributed, heterogeneous data sources and data streams. In this context, semantic web technologies are increasingly considered as key technologies to improve data integration. However, they are mainly used for data that is assumed not to change very often in time. In order to tackle this issue, stream reasoning combines reasoning and stream processing methods. Such a combination enables the processing of dynamic and heterogeneous data continuously produced from a large number of sources and implementing real-time services. This paper presents an approach that uses stream reasoning to identify in real time certain situations that lead to potential failures. Early detection enables to choose the most appropriate decision to avoid the interruption of manufacturing processes. In order to achieve this, data collected from sensors are enriched with contextual information. The use of stream reasoning allows the integration of data from different data sources, with different underlying meanings, different temporal resolutions as well as the processing of these data in real time.","Condition Monitoring,Industry 4.0,Stream Reasoning,Ontology,"

"effective and efficient pixel-level detection for diverse video copy-move forgery types","2022","Video copy-move forgery detection (VCMFD) is a significant and greatly challenging task due to a variety of difficulties, including a huge amount of video information, diverse forgery types, rich forgery objects, and homogenous forgery sources. These difficulties raise four unresolved key challenges in VCMFD: i) ineffective detection in some popular forgery cases; ii) inefficient matching in processing numerous video pixels with hundred-dimensional features under dozens of matching iterations; iii) high false positive (FP) in detecting forgery videos; iv) low trade-off of efficiency and effectiveness in filling forgery region, and even failing in indicating forgeries at the pixel level. In this paper, a novel VCMFD method is proposed to address these issues: i) an innovatively improved SIFT structure that can address the thorough feature extraction in all video copy-move forgery cases; ii) a novel fast keypoint-label matching (FKLM) algorithm is proposed that creates some keypoint-label groups so that every high-dimensional feature is assigned into one of these groups. As a result, matching of video pixels can be directly done on a small number of keypoint-label groups only, leading to a nearly 500% raise in matching efficiency; iii) a new coarse-to-fine filtering relying on intrinsic attributes of exact keypoint-matches is designed to more effectively reduce the false keypoint-matches; iv) the adaptive block filling relying on true keypoint-matches contributes to the accurate and efficient suspicious region filling, even at the pixel level.

"sea surface height measurements using a low-cost gnss buoy with multiple gnss receivers","2023","Accurate Sea surface height (SSH) measurements are important for global climate change and sea level rise monitoring. Satellite altimeters can provide global coverage observations but with coarse temporal and spatial resolution, while tide gauges offer high-precision measurements but are limited to coastal regions. The advent of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) buoys bridge the gap between the tide station and the satellite altimeter, which realize continuous and reliable absolute SSH measurements in the coastal zone. However, most of buoys are equipped with GNSS geodetic receivers and antennas, which are expensive and with high power consumption. The emergence of low-cost receivers has been applied in fields such as autonomous driving and disaster monitoring, yet low-cost receivers suffer precision limitations due to signal quality issue in the harsh marine environment. To solve the reliability issue of low-cost receivers in SSH measurements, firstly, a low-cost buoy platform with four dual-frequency receivers is designed in this contribution. GNSS antennas are installed on the four corners of a square with a side length of 1.180 m, and the total power consumption is less than 4 W. Additionally, a robust outlier detection method, the Geometric Constraint algorithm, is proposed to improve the reliability and accuracy of GNSS SSH results. The performance of our buoy was validated in Jingye Lake at Tianjin University on April 30, 2022, and another experiment was conducted in Bohai Bay, Tianjin, on August 20, 2022, to assess the performance of a self-developed MG-Buoy for SSH measurement under real oceanic conditions. The experimental results indicate that the precision of single-frequency SSH measurement is 0.91 cm using the GNSS Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) technique with a single antenna, while the dual-frequency can achieve 0.50 cm accuracy. After adopting the Geometric Constraint method, the measurement accuracy of single-frequency and dual-frequency SSH values are 0.49 cm and 0.40 cm, respectively, representing a 46.2% and 20.0% improvements compared to the root mean square (RMS) value for the single GNSS antenna.","Geometric Constraint,Sea surface height,Attitude measurements,Multiple GNSS receivers,Low-cost,Buoy,"
"automatic self-reconstruction model for radio map in wi-fi fingerprinting","2022","The Wi-Fi fingerprinting is applied to the indoor positioning system (IPS) based on the radio map, which is the established received signal strength indication (RSSI) fingerprint database. However, since static radio maps built offline are vulnerable to environmental dynamics, interruptions occur in the online phase. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an Automatic Self-Reconstruction (ASR) model that combines Radio Encoding-based Deep Fingerprint Positioning (RE-DFP) and Radio Anomaly Detecting (RAD), which enables seamless positioning of Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The proposed model consists of an encoder-decoder-based RE-DFP network to improve positioning accuracy and data efficiency and a RAD network to analyze environmental dynamics according to APs. In the proposed RE-DFP, a CNN-based encoder is applied to increase efficiency by minimizing the dependence of the radio map, and the position is estimated through an LSTM-based decoder. RAD identifies the AP, which is the cause of the change in the radio map and excludes it from the online phase, preventing a decrease in positioning accuracy. Simultaneously, the proposed model collects the RSSI of the identified AP through crowdsourcing and reconstructs the radio map by itself, enabling a seamless positioning service in the online phase.","Radio map,RE-DFP,Indoor positioning system,Fingerprinting,RAD,"

"uncertainty fusion based object recognition and tracking in maritime scenes using spatiotemporal active contours","2014","This article addresses the problem of near real time video analysis of a maritime scene using a (moving) airborne RGB video camera in the goal of detecting and eventually recognizing a target maritime vessel. This is a very challenging problem mainly due to the high level of uncertainty of a maritime scene including a dynamic and noisy background, camera's and target's motions, and broad variability of background's versus target's appearances. We propose an approach which attempts to combine several types of spatiotemporal uncertainty in a single probabilistic framework. This allows to achieve a likelihood ratio with respect to any possible spatiotemporal configuration of the 2D+T video volume. Using the MAP estimation criterion, such a problem can be recast as as an energy minimization problem that we solve efficiently using a spatiotemporal active contour approach. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using real maritime videos.","Streaming media,Trajectory,Spatiotemporal Active Contours,Airborne Video System,Dynamic Texture Uncertainty,Image color analysis,Uncertainty,Spatiotemporal phenomena,Dynamic Background,Chromatic Uncertainty,Energy Minimization,Cameras,Mathematical model,Maritime Surveillance,Vessel Recognition,MAP Estimation,"
"self-adaptive dynamic obstacle avoidance and path planning for usv under complex maritime environment","2019","The unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is usually required to perform some tasks with the help of static and dynamic environmental information obtained from different detective systems such as shipborne radar, electronic chart, and AIS system. The essential requirement for USV is safe when suffered an emergency during the task. However, it has been proved to be difficult as maritime traffic is becoming more and more complex. Consequently, path planning and collision avoidance of USV has become a hot research topic in recent year. This paper focuses on dynamic obstacle avoidance and path planning problem of USV based on the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) and the Clustering Algorithm (CA) to construct an auto-obstacle avoidance method which is suitable for the complicated maritime environment. In the improved ant colony-clustering algorithm proposed here, a suitable searching range is chosen automatically by using the clustering algorithm matched to different environmental complexities, which can make full use of the limited computing resources of the USV and improve the path planning performances firstly. Second, the dynamic searching path is regulated and smoothed by the maneuvering rules of USV and the smoothing mechanism respectively, which can effectively reduce the path length and the cumulative turning angle. Finally, a simulation example is provided to show that our proposed algorithm can find suitable searching range according to different obstacle distributions, as well as accomplish path planning with good self-adaptability. Therefore, a safe dynamic global path with better optimize performances is achieved with the help of multi-source information.","Path planning,path planning performances,static information,safe dynamic global path,auto-obstacle avoidance method,suitable searching range,path planning problem,remotely operated vehicles,adaptive searching range,ant colony optimisation,Marine vehicles,smoothing mechanism,control engineering computing,Planning,detective systems,ant colony algorithm,dynamic path planning,Collision avoidance,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,dynamic searching path,Ant colony-clustering algorithm,path length,complicated maritime environment,path planning,environmental complexities,search problems,obstacle distributions,dynamic environmental information,complex maritime environment,mobile robots,improved ant colony-clustering algorithm,Sensors,electronic chart,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,USV,Heuristic algorithms,dynamic obstacle avoidance,"

"monitoring changes of ndvi in protected areas of southern california","2018","California’s Mediterranean ecosystem has been identified as one of the Earth’s biodiversity hotspots. The high degree of rapid urbanization along the southern California coastline has resulted in the loss of significant natural areas over the last century and protected areas that do exist may be further threatened by climate change, drought, and fire. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor at a 250 m pixel resolution and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to monitor temporal/spatial patterns from 2000 to 2016 within Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Channel Islands National Park. We test the hypothesis that there should be no significant long-term change in protected areas since 2000 and compare impacts of seasonality, drought, and fire. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area has experienced a long-term decline in vegetation greenness, vegetation types, and is the most significantly impacted with short-term declines during the summer with or without the impacts of fire. Change detection maps show areas of significant decline in NDVI in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area especially during the summer. The Channel Islands have relatively stable NDVI possibly due to the removal of non-native herbivores and the maritime climate around the Channel Islands may buffer some of the impacts of the regional drought. The MODIS sensors appears appropriate for identifying landscape patterns, time series, change detection maps, and the potential impacts from climate change for each park. Results suggest that all National Park landscapes and vegetation types can be inventoried at a 250 m resolution and monitored at a high temporal resolution.","NDVI,Time series,National Parks,Santa Monica Mountains,Mediterranean ecosystems,Channel Islands,MODIS,"
"a collaborative cyber incident management system for european interconnected critical infrastructures","2017","Today's Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) operating in critical infrastructures (CIs) are becoming increasingly complex; moreover, they are extensively interconnected with corporate information systems for cost-efficient monitoring, management and maintenance. This exposes ICSs to modern advanced cyber threats. Existing security solutions try to prevent, detect, and react to cyber threats by employing security measures that typically do not cross the organization's boundaries. However, novel targeted multi-stage attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) take advantage of the interdependency between organizations. By exploiting vulnerabilities of various systems, APT campaigns intrude several organizations using them as stepping stones to reach the target infrastructure. A coordinated effort to timely reveal such attacks, and promptly deploy mitigation measures is therefore required. Organizations need to cooperatively exchange security-relevant information to obtain a broader knowledge on the current cyber threat landscape and subsequently obtain new insight into their infrastructures and timely react if necessary. Cyber security operation centers (SOCs), as proposed by the European NIS directive, are being established worldwide to achieve this goal. CI providers are asked to report to the responsible SOCs about security issues revealed in their networks. National SOCs correlate all the gathered data, analyze it and eventually provide support and mitigation strategies to the affiliated organizations. Although many of these tasks can be automated, human involvement is still necessary to enable SOCs to adequately take decisions on occurring incidents and quickly implement counteractions. In this paper we present a collaborative approach to cyber incident information management for gaining situational awareness on interconnected European CIs. We provide a scenario and an illustrative use-case for our approach; we propose a system architecture for a National SOC, defining the functional components and interfaces it comprises. We further describe the functionalities provided by the different system components to support SOC operators in performing incident management tasks.","Cyber incident reporting,Cyber security,Information sharing,Cyber incident handling,Security operation center,"
"monitoring recent changes of vegetation in fildes peninsula (king george island, antarctica) through satellite imagery guided by uav surveys","2020","Mapping accurately vegetation surfaces in space and time in the ice-free areas of Antarctica can provide important information to quantitatively describe the evolution of their ecosystems. Spaceborne remote sensing is the adequate way to map and evaluate multitemporal changes on the Antarctic vegetation at large but its nature of occurrence, in relatively small and sparse patches, makes the identification very challenging. The inclusion of an intermediate scale of observation between ground and satellite scales, provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery, is of great help not only for their effective classification, but also for discriminating their main communities (lichens and mosses). Thus, this paper quantifies accurately recent changes of the vegetated areas in Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) through a novel methodology based on the integration of multiplatform data (satellite and UAV). It consists of multiscale imagery (spatial resolution of 2 m and 2 cm) from the same period to create a robust classifier that, after intensive calibration, is adequately used in other dates, where field reference data is scarce or not available at all. The methodology is developed and tested with UAV and satellite data from 2017 showing overall accuracies of 96% and kappa equal to 0.94 with a SVM classifier. These high performances allow the extrapolation to a pair of previous dates, 2006 and 2013, when atmospherically clear very high-resolution satellite imagery are available. The classification allows verifying a loss of the total area of vegetation of 4.5% during the 11-year time period under analysis, which corresponds to a 10.3% reduction for Usnea sp. and 9.8% for moss formations. Nevertheless, the breakdown analysis by time period shows a distinct behaviour for each vegetation type which are evaluated and discussed, namely for Usnea sp. whose decline is likely to be related to changing snow conditions.","Vegetation Mapping,Object-based classification,Change detection,Satellite,Permafrost,Antarctica,UAV,"

Internet and computer-based systems inside the boats have changed the relative quietness of a ship at sea to deal with new challenges and threats, viruses, cyber attacks, remote operation and control, etc. Even when in a harbor, a ship appears as very vulnerable as it relies on information systems that can be corrupted. Ensuring security and protection of a ship when at sea or by the coastline raise numerous challenges, as the ship design did not anticipate impacts of recent omnipresence of information and communication technologies.

In this study multispectral multi-platform satellite data was processed to detect change to the surface vegetation of four peatland sites and one heath in Ireland. Spectral and spatial thresholds were used on difference images between master and slave data in the extraction of temporally invariant targets for multi-platform cross calibration. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to evaluate any difference in the cumulative probability distributions of the master, slave and calibrated slave data as expressed by the D statistic, with values reduced by an average of 89.7% due to the cross calibration procedure. A change detection model was created which incorporated a spatial threshold of 9 pixels and a standard deviation (SD) spectral threshold. Kappa accuracy values for the five sites ranged from 80 to 97%, showing that 1.5SD was the optimum spectral threshold for detecting vegetation change. Change detection results showed mean percentage change ranging from 2.11 to 3.28% of total area and cumulative change over the observed time period of between 15.24 and 49.27% of total area.","Peatlands,Change detection,Cross calibration,Heaths,EVI2,"
"efficient lidar-based object segmentation and mapping for maritime environments","2019","This paper proposes a method that utilizes a 3-D occupancy grid to efficiently map a large area while retaining simple representations of objects for path planning and provide spatial characteristics of objects, which may be used for object classification. To enable large-scale mapping of objects, a region around the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is defined where a high density of LiDAR returns is expected, termed the visibility horizon. The polygon intersection between the visibility horizon and the newly detected objects is computed, as well as the polygon subtraction of the visibility horizon from the mapped list of polygons. The two polygon lists are then combined using a polygon union operation, with the objects retaining class designations. The result is a 2-D map that contains polygon representations of objects, where the object is described with a tunable number of vertices and may have an associated object class. Thus, providing necessary information for path planning and tasking.

However, the efficacy of the predictive maintenance strategy relies on selecting the appropriate data processing method and ML model. Existing surveys do not comprehensively inform users or evaluate the quality of the monitoring systems proposed. Hence, this survey reviews the recent literature on ML-driven condition monitoring systems that have been beneficial in many cases.

"dns rebinding threat modeling and security analysis for local area network of maritime transportation systems","2023","Maritime ships and ports have become increasingly digital and intelligent. While intelligent maritime transportation systems bring convenience to the maritime industry, ship operation and management are also confronted with network risks. The Internet of Things (IoT) installed in the shipborne network collects and monitors the environmental data of the whole ship. It uses the collected data to make decisions to control the ship. The threat of Local Area Network (LAN) of IoT in ships has become an emerging issue. The DNS rebinding attack is a typical attack, which can bypass firewalls and seriously threaten the marine network in security and privacy of the local IoT. DNS rebinding attacks are difficult to model and detect, due to their sophisticated characteristics. In this work, we define threat models of DNS rebinding attacks and propose an effective method for the detection of and the defense against these attacks. First, we define threat models for DNS rebinding attacks. We employ a Markov chain to model the process of DNS rebinding attacks. With the threat modeling, the attack behaviors are clearly characterized and the most relevant attributes are thus extracted. Second, we propose an effective method for the detection of DNS rebinding attacks in the marine transportation system. The detection method includes the initialization method and the verification method, which manages and verifies access permission of equipment information and the service interface of the IoT in the shipborn network. Finally, we simulate the DNS rebinding attacks on the marine IoT. We analyze and test the security and the performance of the initialization method and the verification method in the simulated environment. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the IoT in marine networks is vulnerable to DNS rebinding.

"aed-net: an abnormal event detection network","2019","It has long been a challenging task to detect an anomaly in a crowded scene. In this paper, a self-supervised framework called the abnormal event detection network (AED-Net), which is composed of a principal component analysis network (PCAnet) and kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), is proposed to address this problem. Using surveillance video sequences of different scenes as raw data, the PCAnet is trained to extract high-level semantics of the crowd’s situation. Next, kPCA, a one-class classifier, is trained to identify anomalies within the scene. In contrast to some prevailing deep learning methods, this framework is completely self-supervised because it utilizes only video sequences of a normal situation. Experiments in global and local abnormal event detection are carried out on Monitoring Human Activity dataset from University of Minnesota (UMN dataset) and Anomaly Detection dataset from University of California, San Diego (UCSD dataset), and competitive results that yield a better equal error rate (EER) and area under curve (AUC) than other state-of-the-art methods are observed. Furthermore, by adding a local response normalization (LRN) layer, we propose an improvement to the original AED-Net.

"incipient anomalous ionospheric divergence fast detection for coastal differential global navigation satellite system","2023","Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) plays an increasingly important role in the maritime field. Irregular ionospheric divergences may result in DGNSS performance degradation and increase risk in terms of positioning accuracy and navigation integrity. To speed up incipient ionospheric anomaly detection, this paper proposes a novel method for the DGNSS stations which employs (1) the Wasserstein distance (WD) to identify dissimilarity between GNSS pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements and (2) the least-mean-square (LMS) filter to smooth the calculated metrics. The combined WD-LMS is proposed to ensure the rapid identification of abnormal ionospheric divergences.

Both semi-simulated and real experiments are conducted. For the high-elevation angle case, the WD-LMS is even potential to detect large ionospheric divergences within ten epochs. Therefore, the WD-LMS has encouraging potential to enhance maritime DGNSS navigation performance.","DGNSS,Marine navigation,Ionospheric divergences,"
"a deep learning framework for enhancing maritime coastal security","2021","The concerns of coastal security are very dynamic which depends on several factors like the neighbourhood of the country, the terrain and the marine traffic. As in the present system, only the vessels which emit Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams can be detected and identified. Small vessels like some boats do not have AIS system setup, so they can get past without getting detected. Therefore, we propose a solution by framing a deep learning architecture namely faster region based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) which accurately detects vessels in satellite images and outputs the latitude and longitude coordinates which when merged with AIS data helps identify whether the vessel is registered or not. Along with this, our paper also focuses on threat level detections from the unregistered vessels to analyze any terrorizing activity that may occur along the coastline.","Satellites,Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Network,deep learning (artificial intelligence),maritime coastal security,Faster R-CNN,threat level detections,Sea measurements,marine safety,terrorism,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,maritime surveillance,object detection,data streams,longitude coordinates,Haversine,neural net architecture,faster region based convolutional neural network,Real-time systems,latitude coordinates,convolutional neural nets,Tracking,terrorizing activity,Euclidian,Deep learning,Surveillance,deep learning architecture,vessel,Security,AIS data,"
"soil anomaly mapping using a caesium magnetometer: limits in the low magnetic amplitude case","2006","Caesium magnetometers are new tools for soil property mapping with a decimetric resolution [Mathé, V., Lévêque, F., 2003. High resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 212 (1–2), 241–251]. However, when the magnetic anomalies are only a few nanoteslas (nT), the geologic and pedogenic signal must first be isolated from magnetic disturbances for this method to be useful. This paper investigates the instrumental artifacts and environmental disturbances to adapt the survey protocol to slightly magnetic soils. Among the possible instrumental sources of disturbances listed and quantified, the most significant are: 1) The battery effect upon sensors 2 m away (classic protocol, about ±0.15 nT) while increasing this distance up to 10 m cancelled it; 2) The noise level of magnetometers and sensors, which, according to tests on two magnetometers and three sensors, rarely and randomly exceeds 0.1 nT, but seems to increase with the electronic component age. Among the environmental disturbances, temporal variations such as diurnal variation or fluctuations linked to the moving of metallic masses play a major role, although the pseudogradient or base-station methods have commonly cancelled them. The efficiency of the latter is strongly dependent on the source nature. However, the ground currents and electromagnetic fields propagating in soils cause more problems. As a first step to better understand such disturbance sources, uncommon magnetic signal variations supposedly due to electromagnetic wave conversions and likely linked to the railway traffic are presented. Based on previous results, an adapted protocol using one magnetometer and two caesium sensors (0.3 and 1.6 m above the surface) is proposed to increase the signal/noise ratio. At first, to maintain an accurate horizontal and vertical location of the sensors, the latter are affixed to a wooden handcart running on plastic rails. Rails adapt to micro-topography, thereby decreasing strongly the soil–sensors distance variations. Anomalies due to topography rarely exceed 0.1 nT. Finally, a method to remove diurnal variations from high-resolution magnetic maps is proposed. Parallel profiles performed successively are adjusted by a cross-profile. Assuming that the temporal variations during each profile are negligible (less than 0.05 nT), this technique, contrary to the pseudogradient, preserves both the decimetric and the metric anomalies (gain of more than 1 nT).","Marshland soils,Survey protocol,Caesium magnetometer,High-resolution magnetic survey,Seismomagnetic wave conversions,"
"resource management of maritime edge nodes for collected data feedback","2020","With the development of marine economy, more marine applications emerge leading to more deployed sensors and more generated data. However, current marine Internet only provides low transmission rate constrained by limited communication resources and bad transmission environment. How to efficiently use these resources and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) of applications need to be addressed. This paper proposes an online optimization resource management algorithm to improve the communication resource efficiency with guaranteed QoSs for different applications. This algorithm needs neither of the resource cost function nor QoS constraint function at the resource scheduling node. Furthermore, the gradient information, which is usually needed in learning strategies, is not required either. Instead, this algorithm performs resource management of both computation and communication resources in each time slot only based on the observation of the last time slot. With slot-by-slot resource allocation, the communication cost can be minimized to be suitable for maritime scenarios. In the meantime, a long-term delay constraint can be satisfied. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the goal of reducing communication cost while guaranteeing the delay-constraint of different applications. Although more computation resources will improve its performance, this algorithm still can obtain the minimized cost given a low computation resource.","Image edge detection,marine applications,guaranteed QoSs,long-term delay constraint,quality of service,Delays,time slot,online optimization resource management algorithm,Resource management,gradient information,telecommunication scheduling,resource scheduling node,communication cost minimization,Online resource management,resource cost function,Quality of service,learning strategies,data feedback,optimisation,communication resources,computation resources,low computation resource,communication resource efficiency,edge computing,marine economy,maritime edge nodes,collected data feedback,Bandwidth,quality-of-service,communication cost reduction,current marine Internet,low transmission rate,marine communication,Scheduling,slot-by-slot resource allocation,Internet,resource allocation,maritime communications,QoS constraint function,bad transmission environment,"

"efficient on-line anomaly detection for ship systems in operation","2019","We propose novel modifications to an anomaly detection methodology based on multivariate signal reconstruction followed by residuals analysis. The reconstructions are made using Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR), where the query observations are compared to historical observations called memory vectors, representing normal operation. When the data set with historical observations grows large, the naive approach where all observations are used as memory vectors will lead to unacceptable large computational loads, hence a reduced set of memory vectors should be intelligently selected. The residuals between the observed and the reconstructed signals are analysed using standard Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT), where appropriate alarms are raised based on the sequential behaviour of the residuals. The modifications we introduce include: a novel cluster based method to select memory vectors to be considered by the AAKR, which gives an extensive reduction in computation time; a generalization of the distance measure, which makes it possible to distinguish between explanatory and response variables; and a regional credibility estimation used in the residuals analysis, to let the time used to identify if a sequence of query vectors represents an anomalous state or not, depend on the amount of data situated close to or surrounding the query vector. We demonstrate how the anomaly detection method and the proposed modifications can be successfully applied for anomaly detection on a set of imbalanced benchmark data sets, as well as on recent data from a marine diesel engine in operation.","Cluster based AAKR,Maritime industry,Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT),Anomaly detection,Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR),Condition monitoring,"
"infrared small dim target detection under maritime near seaâ€“sky line based on regional-division local contrast measure","2023","Infrared (IR) small dim target detection near the seaâ€“sky line (SSL) is crucial for enhancing the early warning capability of maritime vehicles. However, the interferences caused by the strong contrast have not been properly addressed. Consequently, a specially designed algorithm regional-division local contrast measure (RDLCM) that focuses on the detection of IR small dim targets appearing near the SSL is proposed. First, an SSL detection module based on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) is devised to achieve fast pixel-level SSL detection. Then, a set of regional-division windows (RDWs) are designed according to the strong grayscale contrast distribution around the SSL, and through the division of the effective regions, the RDWs could realize the potential extraction and refinement of the IR small dim targets that appear near the SSL. Experiments on three IR image sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the best detection accuracy among the classical and state-of-the-art algorithms in comparison and runs at 44 frames per second (FPS), which could meet real-time requirements.

"the correlation between po2 and pco2 as a chemical marker for detection of offshore co2 leakage","2020","A controlled CO2 release experiment was carried out in order to mimic unintended leakage of geologically stored CO2, and to study methods for detecting these leak events. The experiment was carried out at 60 m depth in the Oslo Fjord over the course of one month. During the simulated leak events, the water chemistry was monitored by sensors mounted on stationary templates located 10 and 22 m horizontally from the source, as well as sensors mounted on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). During baseline conditions (no CO2 release), we observe a strong biogenic correlation between O2 and CO2. This correlation is lacking during CO2 releases, indicating that the CO2-O2 correlation can be used as a marker for CO2 leakage. The same deviations were not initially detected by the CO2 sensor mounted on the AUV due to the longer response time of membrane-based CO2 sensors. However, by applying response time correction in the post-processing of the AUV CO2 data, the generated CO2 plume was detected. Moreover, the plume was clearly detected by the AUV using the faster responding pH sensors, where the correlation with O2 again could be used to confirm the anomaly.","Geological carbon storage,AUV,CO leakage,Chemical detection,Carbon capture and storage,pH,"
"automated monitoring in maritime video surveillance system","2020","Maritime surveillance for intruders/illegal activities requires monitoring of a large area of the coastline.

However, object detection models trained on general objects datasets cannot be expected to give best performance for this scenario as marine vessels are only a small subset of these huge datasets and also do not classify the specific type of sea vehicle. Hence, their benchmarks are not appropriate for maritime surveillance.

"autonomous inspection of underwater structures","2015","In the future our resource on land will be over exploited. The exploration of new resources in the ocean is in progress. Mining will be done on the bottom of the sea. The sea is also a big source of renewable energy. Off shore wind parks and tide plants are built. Also, the major world trade is handled over sea routes and several big harbors. All this maritime facilities are getting older and there are effects like corrosion or malfunctions. In general, they need to be inspected frequently. For deep sea applications, security reasons and cost reduction autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be the first choice. The project “CView” addresses one of these inspection problems, the harbor inspection. But the algorithms, we present in this article can be adapted to many other inspection tasks. One of the main goals in this project is to find cracks or damaged areas at the underwater buildings or to observe critical sections under water with cost effective methods. The platform for developing the guidance algorithms for inspection is the AUV “SeaCat”. This underwater vehicle has a control software system with an user interface for mission planning, a mission control system, a precise navigation system, optimized motor control with an autopilot and sensors for obstacle detection and inspection. For obstacle and inspection target detection, a scanning sonar is used. The sonar images are automatically processed with edge detection and line extraction algorithms to get a simplified environment description, which is used by the guidance methods presented in this article. A pan–tilt enabled sensor head with camera, laser measurement and MBES (Multi Beam Echo Sounder) is used to inspect the detected objects. Additionally, these sensors provide distance information to the inspection object which can be used by the inspection guidance. This article presents methods for inspection using the online information from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle efficient and safely. It is also important to handle the interaction between mission planning and execution. During mission planning, the operator will define the type of the inspection object (wall, vessel, sluice, etc.). The algorithms we develop use the information from the mission planning and the online data from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle to get the optimal inspection results. Therefore, a precise distance control to the inspection object, collision avoidance and object recognition are needed.","AUV,Underwater,Inspection,Guidance,Autonomous,"
"online fault detection in autonomous ferries: using fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection","2020","Enthusiasm for ship autonomy is flourishing in the maritime industry. In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.","operational reliability,generic threshold limit,acceleration calculation,fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm,variational autoencoder,engine loads,Anomaly detection,fault detector,reliability,multiregime normalization,Acceleration,ship autonomy,prognostics and health management (PHM),neural nets,Autonomous ferry,autonomous ferry crossing operations,system safety,data analysis,marine systems,ships,marine diesel engine degradation,Prognostics and health management,prognostics and health management system,online fault detection,dynamic threshold limit,Diesel engines,data-driven PHM system,mechanical engineering computing,feature selection,feature selection process,diesel engines,Fault detection,condition monitoring,Degradation,environmental conditions,marine diesel engine,maritime industry,failure analysis,Heuristic algorithms,multiregime normalization method,fault diagnosis,velocity calculation,faulty degradation data,"

"in-situ acoustic monitoring of direct energy deposition process with deep learning-assisted signal denoising","2022","In-situ monitoring is crucial for detecting process anomalies and ensuring part quality in additive manufacturing. Acoustic-based monitoring techniques offer extra benefits such as adjustable sensor setup and lower hardware costs. In the direct energy deposition (DED) process, acoustic signals generated by laser-material interactions carry information about underlying complex physical mechanisms such as melting, solidification, crack propagation, and pore formation. This paper presents a novel acoustic-based in-situ monitoring method for the DED process. The raw acoustic signal is made up of laser-material interaction sound as well as noise from machine movement, inert gas flow, and powder flow. A deep learning model is developed to build an end-to-end signal denoising framework to minimize environmental noise and extract the laser-material interaction sound. Audio equalization, bandpass filtering, and Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation algorithm are used to produce a cleaned laser-material interaction sound as the model's ground truth target. Acoustic data is collected from experiments using different DED machines, materials, and varied process parameters to train the deep learning model. The proposed deep learning-assisted signal denoising strategy lays the groundwork for acoustic-based in-situ defect detection of the DED process.","Acoustic Signal Processing,Additive Manufacturing,Direct Energy Deposition,Sound Source Separation,In-situ Monitoring,Deep Learning,"

"machine learning and data-driven fault detection for ship systems operations","2020","Well maintained vessels exhibit high reliability, safety and energy efficiency. Even though machinery failures are inevitable, their occurrence can be foreseen when predictive maintenance schemes are implemented. Predictive maintenance may be optimally applied through condition, performance, and process monitoring. Most importantly, it can include the detection of developing faults, which affect the performance of ship systems and hinder energy-efficient operations of ships. Under this viewpoint, this paper proposes a new data-driven fault detection methodology in a novel application for shipboard systems, by exploring the “learning potential” of recorded voyage data. The proposed methodology, combines the benefits of Expected Behaviour (EB) models, by selecting the optimal regression model, with the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for fault detection, in novel ship applications. It is seen that a multiple polynomial ridge regression model, with testing R2score of nearly 0.96 and can accurately detect certain developing faults manifesting in both the Main Engine (ME) cylinder Exhaust Gas (EG) temperature and the ME scavenging air pressure. The early detection of developing faults can be used to supplement the daily monitoring of ship operations and enable the planning of pre-emptive rectifying actions by reducing sub-optimal machinery conditions.","Pre-processing,Fault detection,Ship machinery systems,Expected behaviour,Machine learning,Ship operations,"

The proposed beam scheduling scheme also takes into account the imperfect detection of targets in real situation. A conventional heuristic beam scheduling approach was modified to incorporate binary integration in radar theory into the RRM strategy. The resulting scheme efficiently handles the complicated beam scheduling problem by considering the target priority as well as the imperfect detection of targets of a real maritime MFR.

Edge detection has played an important role in the interpretation of potential-field data. There are many methods that have been proposed to detect and enhance the edges of geological bodies based on horizontal and vertical derivatives of potential-field data. In order to make full use of all the measured gradient components, we need to develop a new edge detector to process the full tensor gravity gradient data. We first define the directional Theta and use the horizontal directional Theta to define a new edge detector.

Compared the results with other balanced detectors, the new detector can effectively delineate the edges and does not produce any additional false edges.","Horizontal directional Theta method,Full tensor gravity gradient data,Edge detection,"

"use of landsat data to track historical water quality changes in florida keys marine environments","2014","Satellite remote sensing has shown the advantage of water quality assessment at synoptic scales in coastal regions, yet modern sensors such as SeaWiFS or MODIS did not start until the late 1990s. For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (RRS) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS RRS anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002–2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed RRS anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM RRS anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions.","Remote sensing,Water quality,Seagrass,Atmospheric correction,"
"geochemistry of two shallow co2 seeps in shikine island (japan) and their potential for ocean acidification research","2015","Shallow CO2 seeps, where CO2 gas is venting underwater, offer great potential for studies into the effects of ocean acidification at the ecosystem level. To our knowledge, only two tropical system and two temperate systems of such seeps have been described worldwide. Here we describe two new temperate systems: the Mikama Bay and Ashitsuke sites, located on Shikine Island, Japan. The Mikama Bay site is located in a shallow bay. Investigation of the gas and water chemistry showed that the gas contained 98% CO2 and up to 90 ppm H2S. Total alkalinity was constant in time and space with an average of 2265±10 μ mol kg−1. Mapping of Eh and pH showed that the low pH zones were the largest when currents were moderate. Under moderate currents, Eh values were globally higher and total sulfides concentration lower, supporting that a longer residence time of the bay water allow the oxidation of the sulfides to sulfates. Zones suitable for acidification studies: with a pH lower than 8.0, low saturation state of calcite and aragonite, and non-detectable sulfide concentration, can be defined a few meters from the main venting zone. The second site, Ashitsuke, is located in the inter-tidal zone on a shore composed of boulders. Several areas showed reduced pH sometimes restricted to a few meters and up to 20 m long along the shoreline. Temperature was higher in some of the reduced pH zones suggesting the presence of hot springs in addition to vents. This paper also highlights the need for discovering additional CO2 seeps, which by their nature often lack comparable replicates and can be confounded by factors other than CO2. In this regard, Japan offers great potential as it is home to numerous active volcanoes, representing potential venting sites in climates ranging from tropical to sub-polar.","Temperate Pacific Ocean,Japan,Ocean acidification,CO seep,Geochemistry,"

"maritime object detection with event-based cameras","2022","Event cameras differ from conventional frame-based cameras in that each individual pixel responds independently and asynchronously to brightness changes. Instead of absolute brightness measurements reported as entire frames at regular time intervals, data from event cameras come as a stream of spatially and temporally sparse brightness change events. Event cameras have several characteristics that are favorable to maritime computer vision tasks, including high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. In this work, we apply Asynet, a sparse convolutional neural network based object detection model, to maritime event data sets we collected in the field. To address the limited size of our data set, we propose fine-tuning from pretrained weights learned from the neuromorphic Caltech101 (N-Caltech101) data set and then using a combination of augmentation techniques drawn from traditional image-based computer vision as well as event-specific augmentations. Empirical findings show that using simple image-based augmentation strategies are enough to significantly boost the performance of the Asynet model.","maritime event data sets,simple image-based augmentation strategies,event-based cameras,Cameras,spatially brightness change events,maritime object detection,absolute brightness measurements,brightness changes,individual pixel responds,maritime computer vision tasks,cameras,computer vision,object detection,conventional frame-based cameras,image classification,event cameras,high temporal resolution,event-specific augmentations,Brightness,convolutional neural nets,Training,temporally sparse brightness change events,image sensors,Object detection,Computational modeling,learning (artificial intelligence),Computer vision,traditional image-based computer vision,Detectors,"
"a probabilistic analytics method to identify striking ship of ship-buoy contact at coastal waters","2022","The identification of the ship that contact with the buoy can provide evidence for accident accountability. To this aim, the paper develops a probabilistic analytics method to evaluate the ship-buoy contact risk for the striking ship identification at the coastal areas by combining buoy domain and bounding box models. The method makes use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and navigational buoy data. Firstly, an AIS-based probabilistic buoy domain model is adopted for the determination of the safety boundary of the buoy to detect potential striking ships with a higher contact probability. Then, the bounding boxes of the navigational buoy and the detected potential striking ships are developed to detect the real striking ship by analyzing the interaction between the ship bounding box and the buoy bounding box. Finally, the probabilistic analytics method is demonstrated in the South China Sea and validated using historical ship-buoy contact records. Results indicated that, from a probabilistic perspective, the safety buoy domain (critical boundary) existed with diverse distances dynamically. The proposed method could assist the identification of striking ships while aiding the definition of the safety buoy domain for preventing ship-buoy contacts. As a result, it has the potential to support the development of ship-buoy contact risk management and assist surveillance operators and master on board by improving their cognitive abilities in dangerous traffic scenarios.","Maritime safety,Collision,Safety domain,AIS data,Striking ships identification,"
"realistic extended target model for track before detect in maritime surveillance","2015","Traditional target tracking algorithms are generally fed a set of thresholded detections under the hypothesis that no more than one detection is generated by each single target. Improvements in modern radar systems have made possible to obtain high resolution data of the targets, making them occupy more than a single resolution cell, and have made necessary to use appropriate Extended Target Tracking (ETT) techniques, since the aforementioned hypothesis is no longer valid. However, these techniques do not often take into account the physical phenomena that are involved in the radar-sea-target system. This paper explores some of the effects involved in the transmission, propagation, backscattering and processing of the radar signal in a maritime environment, that have a crucial importance in ETT. A statistical model that considers the featured effects is developed and tested in a particle filter based Track before Detect (TbD) algorithm. Accounting for physical aspects, good outcomes in both kinematic (i.e. position and velocity) and size (i.e. width and length) estimation can be pointed out using real radar data acquired by a high resolution X-band Marine radar located in the Gulf of La Spezia, Italy.","maritime surveillance environment,marine radar,radar-sea-target system,Radar antennas,radar detection,statistical model,data acquisition,Italy,Antenna radiation patterns,TbD algorithm,statistical analysis,target tracking,Target tracking,particle filtering (numerical methods),Gulf of La Spezia,radar signal backscattering,search radar,Radar tracking,radar signal propagation,Convolution,radar signal processing,high resolution X-band marine radar,radar tracking,track before detect algorithm,radar signal transmission,Clutter,radar resolution,extended target tracking technique,particle filter,data target resolution,backscatter,ETT technique,oceanographic techniques,"

Besides the feasibility of the snippet backscatter data, it was focused on the attainable horizontal accuracy in comparison to side-scan sonar and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys. The data was collected in shallow coastal waters of up to 18 m water depth (Baltic Sea) close to an ammunition dumping site characterized by an almost flat seafloor covered with sand and silt sediments.

"knowledge discovery using genetic algorithm for maritime situational awareness","2014","Due to the large volume of data related to vessels, to manually pore through and to analyze the information in a bid to identify potential maritime threat is tedious, if at all possible. This study aims to enhance maritime situational awareness through the use of computational intelligence techniques in detecting anomalies. A knowledge discovery system based on genetic algorithm termed as GeMASS was proposed and investigated in this research. In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels’ geographical and movement information. This study investigated a novel leverage of multiple data sources, including Automatic Identification System, classification societies, and port management and security systems for the enhancement of maritime security.

"maritime targets velocity estimation in space-based passive multistatic radar using long integration times","2021","Target detection by means of space-based passive radar sensors generally requires the adoption of long integration time strategies to reinforce sufficiently the signal strength. These are usually based on the recovery of the target Doppler-rate to cope with the range and Doppler migration experienced over the long dwell considered. In this work, we put forward a Taylor-series approach that capitalizes on the set of bistatic Doppler-rates estimated in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-based multistatic radar configurations to estimate the velocity of ship targets with increased accuracy with respect to conventional Doppler-based procedures. Both the cases of single-element and array receiver configurations have been considered. Theoretical and numerical results under different use cases show as leveraging on the long integration times adopted at the detection stage could significantly increase the accuracy of the estimated ship velocity components. Few experimental results are also provided, verifying the potentialities of the proposed approach in operative scenarios of practical interest for this technology.

"scalable anomaly-based intrusion detection for secure internet of things using generative adversarial networks in fog environment","2023","The data generated exponentially by a massive number of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) are extremely high-dimensional, large-scale, non-labeled, which poses great challenges to timely analysis and effective decision making for anomaly detection in IoT. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning method to identify anomalies against IoT networks, which exploits Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) to build model on normal IoT data. The model introduces Wasserstein distance to capture and learn the distribution of high-dimensional raw data and focuses on latent representations using an auxiliary classifier. A cycle consistency connection between data is designed to prevent information loss that helps to reduce false positive rate. The model detects outliers by utilizing reconstruction error in feature space. Another challenge facing the current anomaly detection solutions is their limited scalability, which restricts capability in handling big IoT data. This issue is resolved by deploying and jointly training the proposed method in a fog computing environment. The anomaly-based intrusion detection can be scalable by leveraging the flexibility of fog computing, which contributes to supporting efficient detection. Experimental results on two recent datasets (i.e., UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017) validate that the proposed method achieves 4% increase in accuracy and 4% reduction in false alarm rate than the state-of-the-art methods while keeping computational efficiency.","Intrusion detection,Anomaly detection,Internet of Things,Generative adversarial networks,Fog computing,"

The system automatically identifies objects in a maritime scene and uses the detected motion to alert a human observer to potential collision situations. Three integrated image-processing algorithms, namely an image preprocessor, a motion cue generator, and a target tracker, perform the identification and tracking of maritime objects. The pre-processing filters the image and applies a histogram technique to segment the sea from potential objects of interest. The segmented image is passed to the motion cue generator, which provides motion cues based on the differences between consecutive frames of segmented image data. The target tracker applies dynamic constraints on object motion to solve the correspondence problem, thus increasing the confidence that an identified object is a target.

"a spectral-based clustering for structural health monitoring of the sydney harbour bridge","2017","This paper presents the results of a large scale Structural Health Monitoring application on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia. This bridge has many structural components, and our work focuses on a subset of 800 jack arches under the traffic lane 7. Our goal is to identify which of these jack arches (if any) respond differently to the traffic input, due to potential structural damages or instrumentation issues. We propose a novel non-model-based method to achieve this objective, using a spectrum-driven feature based on the Spectral Moments (SMs) from measured responses from the jack arches. SMs contain information from the entire frequency range, thus subtle differences between the normal signals and distorted ones could be identified. Our method then applies a modified k-means−− clustering algorithm to these features, followed by a selection mechanism on the clustering results to identify jack arches with abnormal responses. We performed an extensive evaluation of the proposed method using real data from the bridge. This evaluation included a control component, where the approach successfully detected jack arches with already known damage or issues. It also included a test component, which applied the method to a large set of nodes over a month of data to detect any potential anomaly. The detected anomalies turned out to have indeed system issues after further investigations.","Structural Health Monitoring,-means−−,Spectral Moment,Anomaly Detection,Power Spectral Density,Clustering,"
"sarfish: space-based maritime surveillance using complex synthetic aperture radar imagery","2022","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an essential part of maritime surveillance since it can operate in most weather conditions, day and night. Space-borne SAR especially can provide a large surveillance coverage in which both ground-range detected (GRD) imagery at a reduced resolution and single-look complex (SLC) imagery at a finer resolution of the same observation scene are available. Recently, a large, fully labeled, Sentinel-1 GRD based dataset, named xView3-SAR, was released to promote machine learning (ML) research in detection and classification of ships in order to assist with monitoring illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. In this paper, the xView3-SAR's companion SLC dataset, called the SARFish, is introduced. The aim is to promote the use of SLC data for improving IUU fishing ship detection and classification. An ML-based algorithm using the combined GRD-SLC SAR data is presented as a base-line model for demonstration. The algorithm consists of a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector whose false-alarm rate is reduced by a cascade of classifiers trained using the GRD data, followed by a ship classifier trained using the SLC data. Preliminary results suggest that despite not using multi-looks to reduce sea-clutter spikes, the use of SLC images does not degrade ship detection.

The first design feature of WODIS utilizes the use of an encoder network to extract high-level data based on different sampling rates.

"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA.

By observing vessel tracks, the behavior can be derived from the driven maneuvers of a vessel. Extracting maneuvers out of historical observation data (e.g. AIS) is an important task. In the following work the authors propose the Maneuver Net generation process for deriving the sailing behavior and how Maneuver Nets can be used for unplanned maneuver detection.","maritime traffic,sailing behavior,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,statistical maneuver net generation,maneuver net generation process,Planning,historical observation data,vessel tracks,driven maneuvers,marine engineering,radar,AIS,test case generation,Artificial intelligence,highly automated systems,Trajectory,maritime observation systems,Navigation,Task analysis,unplanned maneuver detection,navigational waterways,data handling,oceanographic techniques,"
"beyond visible light: usage of long wave infrared for object detection in maritime environment","2021","Autonomous navigation of land vehicles has come a long way owing to the advances in scene parsing capabilities enabled by deep learning. Maritime environment shows an equally great promise in such autonomy and research specific to this domain is gaining rapid momentum. Extreme weather and light conditions are typical at seas and optical cameras commonly used on land face limitations in such environment. This paper proposes usage of Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) cameras to overcome these challenges. We evaluate the effectiveness of LWIR by running semantic segmentation against two deep learning architectures under normal and challenging conditions and then comparing their performance against their optical counterparts. Experimental results show that LWIR outperforms optical in such extreme weather and light conditions and will prove very effective in the maritime environment. Integrating LWIR with optical, radar and other sensors in the robotic navigation systems can improve the accuracy of object detection and avoidance in autonomous surface vehicles. The research also focuses on key areas where the algorithm can be enhanced as well as creation of a public maritime dataset of LWIR images as the next steps.","Ultraviolet sources,Optical imaging,long wave infrared images,long wave infrared cameras,deep learning (artificial intelligence),extreme weather,semantic segmentation,Surface waves,robot vision,normal conditions,light conditions,LWIR images,control engineering computing,scene parsing capabilities,optical cameras,deep learning architectures,Integrated optics,marine engineering,radar,cameras,object detection,public maritime dataset,autonomous surface vehicles,land vehicles,path planning,robotic navigation systems,marine robotics,Training,infrared imaging,land face limitations,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,image sensors,Object detection,Navigation,image segmentation,deep learning architecture,autonomous navigation,visible light,"
"bio-inspired topology control mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicles used in maritime surveillance","2013","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in maritime applications to acquire underwater information. With the guidance of intelligent topology control algorithms, AUVs adjust their positions efficiently such that they achieve desired underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) configurations. A suitable application can be using AUVs in surveillance tasks, where they uniformly spread throughout a harbor entry or around a large civilian or military maritime vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier) to detect any hostile or unexpected underwater intrusions. Since geographical characteristics are different for each port (shape, depth, etc.) and underwater currents constantly change, manually controlling underwater vehicles for these tasks is not feasible. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based topology control mechanism, called 3D-PSO, for AUVs operating in unknown 3D underwater spaces. 3D-PSO uses limited information collected from an AUV's neighborhood to make movement decisions over an unknown 3D space. Each AUV, using our 3D-PSO, is able to adjust its movement speed and direction to achieve a better location towards obtaining a uniform distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, despite the significant variance of topographies of harbor entrances and the undersides of ships, 3D-PSO is an efficient tool to guide AUVs in creating a protection area for a harbor or a maritime vessel.","surveillance,topology control,bio-inspired topology control mechanism,harbor entrances,underwater information,civilian vessel,bio-inspired algorithms,particle swarm optimisation,3D-PSO,underwater wireless sensor networks,protection area,Network topology,wireless sensor networks,Topology,maritime surveillance,self-organizing networks,particle swarm optimization,autonomous underwater vehicles,Underwater vehicles,unknown 3D underwater spaces,harbor entry,surveillance tasks,military maritime vessel,Nickel,UWSN configurations,marine vehicles,intelligent topology control algorithms,underwater wireless sensor network configuration,AUVs,security,unexpected underwater intrusion detection,Mobile nodes,geographical characteristics,"
"combining fm broadcast, accelerometers, ieee 892.15.4 wireless and gps to secure maritime containers worldwide","2010","There are approximately 50 million maritime style containers entering and leaving ports in North America every year and 500 millions worldwide [8]. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies solely based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by combining GPS with a tracking system based on the FM broadcast signal. Digital FM broadcast is an alternative man-made signal that is ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. The combination of GPS and FM, called 'Broadcast Assisted GPSâ„¢' allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM-GPS receiver that can trace the path that a container has taken for less than 25$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2010-2011) of such a low cost, covert, 'Broadcast Assisted GPS'based technology, called 'FM-RFID Tagâ„¢' that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container intrusion, either door or side panel intrusion.","accelerometers,container tracking,container intrusion,FM broadcast,Monitoring,Global Positioning System,maritime containers,object tracking,Containers,Noise,IEEE 892.15.4 wireless,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Active RFID,sea ports,USA Councils,containers,GPS,Logic gates,radiofrequency identification,Receivers,Maritime container traceability,tracking system,"
"eprd: exploiting prior knowledge for evidence-providing automatic rumor detection","2023","With the prevalence of social media platforms, rumors have been a serious social problem. Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility. Experiments on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that EPRD consistently exhibits the best rumor detection performance. Moreover, EPRD outperforms other baselines in the early rumor detection task.","Deep learning,Graph neural network,Rumor detection,Evidence,Natural language inference,"

"a machine learning-based accuracy enhancement on eumetsat h-saf h35 effective snow-covered area product","2022","Snow is a major element of the cryosphere with significant impact on the Earth's water cycle and global energy budget. Acquiring consistent and long time series data on the spatial extent of snow cover doubtlessly plays a key role in our understanding and modeling of the current and future environmental dynamics. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for continuous retrieval of snow cover information by utilizing snow's contrasting reflectance characteristics at optical wavelengths. The pre-operational H35 covers the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the successor of the operational Pan-European H12 daily fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) product at ~1 km. Both products are developed through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of EUMETSAT by exploiting AVHRR channels. This study is focused on developing an alternative fully data-driven H35 product with improved accuracy using a machine learning (ML)-based approach. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithm is trained by using AVHRR reflectance data as well as the well-known snow and vegetation indices (i.e., NDSI and NDVI) to generate the new version of H35 fSCA product. The reference fSCA maps required for the training of MARS models are obtained from the higher resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The MARS-based fSCA models are validated against an initial test dataset composed of 15 Sentinel 2 scenes over European Alps, Tatra Mountain Range, and Turkey. The final MARS-H35 product is then rigorously assessed over the whole Northern Hemisphere within a temporal domain spanning from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019. The quantitative testing process involves the use of reference data in both continuous and dichotomous scales: i) Sentinel 2 derived reference fSCA maps, ii) ERA5-Land snow depth data, iii) MODIS MOD10A1 NDSI snow cover data, and finally iv) in-situ snow depth data. Additionally, qualitative assessment is also performed by visually comparing MARS-H35/MODIS false-color and MARS-H35/Sentinel 2-derived reference fSCA image pairs over various geographic regions. The overall results indicate that: i) the proposed MARS-H35 fSCA product overperforms the original H35, and ii) it has higher capability in detecting the fine variations in the extent of snow cover, especially across the fringes of the slopes in complex mountainous terrains.","Multivariate adaptive regression splines,Sentinel 2,ERA5-Land,Remote sensing of the cryosphere,Fractional snow cover mapping,AVHRR,MODIS,"

"antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection in high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars","2023","Mechanically scanning radars are still widely used in ocean guard and surveillance areas nowadays, owing to simple structure, light weight and low cost. The antenna rotation causes amplitude modulation of target returns along pulses by the antenna azimuth beampattern. The traditional coherent detection that ignores this modulation suffers from some performance loss. In this article, an antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector and a dual-threshold detection scheme are proposed for high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars. First, it is shown that the modulation of target returns is determined by the antenna azimuth beampattern, scan rate, and pulse repetition interval and the antenna scanning also affect the temporal correlation of sea clutter. Second, the antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detector is given in compound-Gaussian sea clutter with inverse Gamma distributed texture and the pulse scanning mode is used to deal with unknown target azimuth angle in the matched filter. Third, to mitigate the high computational cost of the pulse scanning mode, a dual-threshold scheme is given, which searches all pulse-range cells by short-time integration and further confirms suspected cells whose test statistics are between the two lower and higher thresholds in the search by long-time integration. Moreover, two fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms along pulses and range cells are presented, which bring a great reduction in computational complexity. Finally, real measured radar data is used to verify the proposed detector and scheme and the experimental results show that it behaves better in detection of small targets than the traditional detectors.","Antennas,covariance matrices,maritime surveillance radars,Radar antennas,mechanically scanning maritime surveillance radars,radar detection,radar clutter,high-resolution mechanically scanning maritime surveillance,compound-Gaussian sea clutter,sea clutter,amplitude modulation,target returns,dual-threshold detection scheme,matched filter,optimum coherent detector,scan rate,surveillance areas,ocean guard,gamma distribution,traditional coherent detection,dual-threshold scheme,Antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,Gaussian processes,matrix inversion,search radar,measured radar data,unknown target,Radar,radar signal processing,antenna azimuth beampattern,antenna beampattern matched optimum coherent detection,high computational cost,azimuth beampattern modulation,Doppler radar,computational complexity,Clutter,scanning radars,fast recursive clutter covariance matrix inversion algorithms,pulse scanning mode,antenna rotation,Surveillance,pulse-range cells,antenna scanning,pulse repetition interval,Radar detection,"
"deep reinforcement learning based trajectory optimization for magnetometer-mounted uav to landmine detection","2022","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a viable choice for data collection and landmine (LM) detection. The LM buried under the dirt or sand is detected using a UAV-mounted magnetometer in this paper. A UAV is deployed to gather data along the intended route when the magnetometer receives a signal from the LMs. During a whole round of data collection, we want to reduce the total energy consumption of the UAV-Magnetometer-LM system. To do this, we turn the energy consumption reduction issue into a limited combinatorial optimization problem by concurrently picking time slots and arranging the UAV’s visitation sequence to identify the LM. The problem of minimizing energy usage is NP-hard, making it difficult to solve optimally. In order to tackle this challenge, we used the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme. DDPG is used to enhance the convergence speed and eliminate redundant computations. Furthermore, to improve the detection in real-time, we proposed the proximal online policy technique (POPT). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme consumes 37.14%, 31.25%, and 21.42% better results than synthetic aperture radar (SAR), convolution neural network (CNN), and double deep recurrent Q-network (DDRQN).","DRL,Magnetometer,Landmine,Energy,UAV,"
"an unambiguous imaging method of moving target for maritime scenes with spaceborne high-resolution and wide-swath sar","2022","In azimuth multichannel high-resolution and wide-swath (AMC-HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, undersampling of azimuth signal results in the failure of the single-channel echo imaging, so the echoes of all the channels should be reconstructed to obtain the unambiguous SAR image. Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the stationary scene echoes. However, moving targets (MTs) will cause false targets in the reconstructed SAR image, which has a great influence on SAR image interpretation and moving target detection, especially in maritime scenes. Hence, we propose an unambiguous imaging method of the moving target for maritime scenes with AMC-HRWS SAR. First, azimuth deramp processing is introduced to obtain coarse-focused moving targets, and then their echoes can be extracted from the sea clutter. Based on the extracted data, a radial velocity estimation method is proposed, which is high efficiency and does not require redundant channels. In addition, based on the estimated radial velocity and the characteristics of the coarse-focused signal, a novel signal reconstruction method of moving target is presented. The reconstruction performance of this method is not affected by channel imbalance, and false targets can be removed even if there is radial velocity error. Besides, the effectiveness of this scheme is verified by the simulation data and GaoFen-3 SAR real data. The estimated radial velocities of ships are verified by automatic identification system (AIS) information. The imaging results show that false targets are effectively suppressed, and moving targets are located in correct positions.","moving target detection,GaoFen-3 SAR real data,stationary scene echoes,SAR image interpretation,Image reconstruction,image resolution,azimuth multichannel high-resolution,image sampling,wide-swath SAR,single-channel echo imaging,Synthetic aperture radar,Signal reconstruction,high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS),AMC-HRWS SAR,false targets,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,radial velocity estimation method,signal reconstruction,unambiguous imaging method,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,moving target (MT) signal reconstruction,novel signal reconstruction method,radial velocity estimation,maritime scenes,Azimuth,spaceborne high-resolution,unambiguous SAR image,Imaging,maritime scene,Estimation,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),reconstructed SAR image,Azimuth multichannel (AMC),"

"optimal offloading of computing-intensive tasks for edge-aided maritime uav systems","2022","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the maritime environment. In the maritime UAV tracking system, due to the large size of the image computing-task and the shortage of UAV batteries and computational capability, the UAV needs to offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce energy consumption and task latency. However, the task latency is still too long for the UAV tracking algorithm due to the large image size. We research the impact of image resolution on the computing task size and detection accuracy, and formulate an edge-aided UAV system with dynamic image resolution. With the constraint on task latency, we jointly optimize the image resolution, offloading rate, transmission power and local central processing unit (CPU) frequency to minimize energy consumption. Although the proposed problem is non-convex, we transform it into a convex optimization problem through decoupling and problem decomposition, and obtain an optimal offloading strategy. The numerical results show the energy efficiency of the proposed strategy by comparing it with the local first offloading strategy and the edge first offloading strategy.","Image edge detection,autonomous detecting,image resolution,Energy consumption,Vehicular and wireless technologies,edge computing server,image size,unmanned aerial vehicle,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,tracking task,convex optimization problem,UAV batteries,offload,visual target tracking,Autonomous aerial vehicles,power aware computing,computational capability,optimal offloading strategy,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,computing task size,autonomous aerial vehicles,marine engineering computing,dynamic image resolution,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,energy conservation,computing-intensive task,Transforms,UAV tracking algorithm,UAV,edge-aided UAV system,image computing-task,"
"robust infrared maritime target detection based on visual attention and spatiotemporal filtering","2017","It has always been a great challenge to efficiently detect small infrared targets from complex image backgrounds without any prior knowledge. This is especially true when both strong and weak targets appear in the same image or when the weak targets come up on image borders. The main contribution of this paper is to design a robust infrared maritime target detection method, in which a visual attention and pipeline-filtering model is proposed by integrating a revised visual attention model (VAM) and the antivibration pipeline-filtering algorithm. The revised VAM, a single-frame target detection strategy, will first compute a saliency map (SM) from a specific modality, which is automatically selected according to image background smoothness. Then, an automatic strategy for extracting suspected targets from an SM is also proposed here, which highlights targets and suppresses background clutters in SMs through local saliency singularity evaluation. Moreover, contrary to the original VAM, we adopt border saliency preservation in center-surround difference so that robust detection can be guaranteed for targets on image borders. Finally, to eliminate the interference of sea glints and confirm real targets, we adopt the antivibration pipeline-filtering algorithm, a multiframe-based clutter removal method. Compared with the original VAM and two other existing target detection algorithms, experimental results have proven that our strategy can detect infrared maritime targets much better under different environmental conditions.

In previous work, ad hoc approaches for classifying maritime vessels were applied to large sets of single AIS messages. The resulting performance has been explored based on real-life datasets in different maritime areas. The approaches were used in a particular application scenario of detecting AIS spoofing in fishery scenarios. Seeing good classification results, in particular by Random Forests, the questions arise whether these at least partly resulted from overfitting phenomena and which of the feature of classification in this problem are most relevant. To address these questions in the current contribution, AIS messages are aggregated per vessel and by the hour by statistical means providing a new AIS feature representation as a basis for classification. By providing a new data representation to the Random Forest classifier, we evaluate classification performance. Then we restrict the presented data to the semantic feature subgroups of the vesselâ€™s positional, course, speed, and dimensions data individually and identify the key features of the classification. The results show that in our exemplary maritime experiments, classification relies mostly on vesselsâ€™ positional and dimensional information.","Semantics,experimental comparison,aggregated messages,Random forests,Surveillance,Classification,Artificial intelligence,key features,Sensitivity,Task analysis,Behavioral sciences,performance evaluation,maritime surveillance systems,AIS,"

"development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification of marine systems","2022","As part of any Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system for the shipping industry, the determination of the current health of marine systems is fundamental. As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task.

"early anomaly detection in smart home: a causal association rule-based approach","2018","As the world's population grows older, an increasing number of people are facing health issues. For the elderly, living alone can be difficult and dangerous. Consequently, smart homes are becoming increasingly popular. A sensor-rich environment can be exploited for healthcare applications, in particular, anomaly detection (AD). The literature review for this paper showed that few works consider environmental factors to detect anomalies. Instead, the focus is on user activity and checking whether it is abnormal, i.e., does not conform to expected behavior. Furthermore, reducing the number of anomalies using early detection is a major issue in many applications. In this context, anomaly-cause discovery may be helpful in recommending actions that may prevent risk. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the risk of anomalies occurring in the environment regarding user activities. The method relies on anomaly-cause extraction from a given dataset using causal association rules mining. These anomaly causes are utilized afterward for real-time analysis to detect the risk of anomalies using the Markov logic network machine learning method. The detected risk allows the method to recommend suitable actions to perform in order to avoid the occurrence of an actual anomaly. The proposed approach is implemented, tested, and evaluated for each contribution using real data obtained from an intelligent environment platform and real data from a clinical datasets. Experimental results prove our approach to be efficient in terms of recognition rate.","Anomaly detection,Markov logic network,Smart homes,Causal association rules,"
"metallogenic domains and their reflection in regional lake sediment surveys from the meguma zone, southern nova scotia, canada","1990","Approximately 3000 samples from a regional centre-lake bottom sediment survey of southern Nova Scotia were re-analyzed for sixteen elements of metallogenic significance. Analytical results for Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Li, F, Nb, Sn, Ti, Zr, Rb, Th, Sb, As, W and Au confirm that most known mineral deposits and metallogenic domains in the Meguma Zone have detectable geochemical signatures in lake sediments. Lake sediment exploration is most effective for mapping when a catchment basin model is employed. In southern Nova Scotia, lake sediment surveys are especially useful when prospecting and selecting areas of potential lithophile mineralization. Mineralogical expressions of Sn, W, Th and Zr in lake sediment are reflected by the presence of discrete grains of cassiterite, scheelite or wolframite, monazite and zircon. Free gold has also been identified in lake sediment, and may be the cause of some identified Au anomalies. Lake catchment basins contain mixtures of hydromorphically and mechanically dispersed components. After relatively short transport distances from a bedrock or till source heavy minerals can be trapped in lake catchment basins. Meguma Zone lake sediment anomalies may be grouped into those dominated by these hydromorphic and mechanical-weathering processes. Geochemical mapping using lake sediments is undertaken through the application of simple data reduction procedures using single- and multi-element methods. Geochemical maps for individual elements are produced as computer-contoured colour plots at a fixed percentile scale. Maps for Sn, W, Au and Ag outline known mineral occurrences as distinct anomalies for the East Kemptville Sn-Zn-Cu ± W, Millet Brook U-Cu-Ag and numerous Au vein deposits within defined bedrock metallogenic domains. Geochemical mapping of Au and Ag anomalies also indicates large-scale structures such as northwesterly trending shear zones. Large shear zones are outlined by Au anomalies, and W highs define areas of new potential in exo-contact zones of the South Mountain Batholith. Gold potential for granitoid rocks is indicated by numerous Au anomalies. Associations of Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag, F-Li-Nb-Rb + Sn, Zr-Ti-Th and Sb-As-Au-W are plotted with multi-element score maps. Boundaries of the score maps closely follow the bedrock metallogenic domains and outline areas of potential economic mineralization. Regional geochemical mapping can be accomplished successfully, accurately and at reasonable cost using lake sediments. Modern analytical packages offer high-precision techniques for lake sediment analysis. Compared to regional till surveys in this area, lake sediment surveys cost less and have spatial attributes that produce data more suited to geochemical mapping projects.",""
"submarine groundwater discharge detection through remote sensing: an application of landsat 7 and 8 in hawaiʻi and ireland","2022","Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) represents an important component of the global water cycle. Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.","Coastal waters,Submarine groundwater discharge,Ocean color,Sea surface temperature,"

"floating small target detection based on the dual-polarization cross-time-frequency distribution in sea clutter","2022","In this paper, a polarization fusion detection method based on dual-polarization cross-time-frequency distribution is proposed to improve the detection performance compared with the original TF-feature-based detector in floating target detection in sea clutter background. Utilizing the received echoes information from the dual-polarization channels, time-frequency distributions (TFD) of radar returns from each polarization channel and the cross-time-frequency distribution (CTFD) of the two channels are computed. Weighted geometric average based on the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) is used to calculate a weighted fusion TFD based on the TFDs and CTFD from dual-polarization channels. To observe differences between sea clutter and target precisely, normalized time-frequency distributions (NTFD) of the cell under test (CUT) are calculated by the mean and variance of the fusion TFD computed from the reference range cells adjacent to the CUT. And the three existing features, the ridge integration (RI), the number of connected regions (NR) and the maximal size of connected regions (MS) are extracted from the NTFD and the convexhull learning algorithm is used to construct a polarization fusion detector in the feature space. Analyses of experimental results on the recognized IPIX database show that the proposed polarization fusion detector obtains superior detection performance compared to the original TF-feature-based detector and has competitive detection performance compared to other existing excellent feature-based detectors.","Time-frequency distribution,Sea clutter,Polarization fusion,Cross time-frequency distribution,Floating target detection,"

A prime example of it are smart city applications with forecasting urban traffic flow as a key application. However, data privacy becomes a real issue. This problem can be addressed by using federated learning trusted authority principle. In this paper, we investigate a novel federated deep learning approach to urban traffic flow forecasting that graph learning, and trusted authority mechanism. The road network is first pre-processed to eliminate the noise from the traffic data. Next, detecting anomalous features is performed to prune irrelevant edges and patterns. The generated graph is then utilized to learn a graph convolutional neural network for calculating the future city’s traffic flow. We extensive evaluate our federated learning-based framework, where a case study on predicting the future traffic flows has been carried out using multiple datasets. We examine it with different baseline techniques as well. The findings show that the suggested framework greatly outperforms the baseline methods, particularly when the graph has a lot of nodes. Importantly, our approach is the first one that integrates trusted authority principle in federated learning and, by doing so, it is able to efficiently secure model data. Moreover, the average precision of the developed model reached 84%, while the baseline solutions did not exceed 77%.","Smart city environment,Federated deep learning,Prediction traffic flows,"

"background modeling combined with multiple features in the fourier domain for maritime infrared target detection","2022","To detect ship targets in dynamic sea backgrounds, a robust foreground detection method based on background modeling combined with multiple features in the Fourier domain (BMMFF) is proposed. Because the fluctuation of seawater is similar to a sine wave, the amplitude spectrum of the seawater in the Fourier domain has strong energy concentration, and the background model is built in the Fourier domain. The local statistical characteristics can effectively reflect the properties of a specific position, and the target frequency points are extracted by comparing the local statistical characteristic differences between the amplitude spectrum of the test frame and the updated background. Additionally, two different strategies are used to update the background for cases with or without sudden waves in two adjacent test frames. When the target and seawater have different contrast in different scenes, the threshold is set according to the seawaterâ€™s fluctuation degree, which is classified into three different levels in the training stage. Moreover, the linear correlation feature between the test frame and the updated background and the oscillation feature of the test frameâ€™s amplitude spectrum are proposed in the Fourier domain, which can better segment targets in relatively calm and violent sea scenes, respectively. Thus, the two features are combined with the background model with a reasonable strategy to further improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that BMMFF outperforms related comparison algorithms in different challenging sea scenes. The average false alarm rate of BMMFF is reduced by approximately 30% in the case where its average detection rate is similar to that of other algorithms.","target frequency points,linear correlation feature,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,seawater,sea scenes,statistical analysis,dynamic sea backgrounds,ships,marine engineering,background modeling,object detection,ship targets,Oscillators,feature extraction,Correlation,Adaptation models,foreground detection method,infrared imaging,Dual-mode sea background model,local statistical characteristic differences,Object detection,image segmentation,Data mining,oscillation feature,Fourier domain,maritime infrared target detection,"

"greenhouse gas emissions from marine decommissioned hydrocarbon wells: leakage detection, monitoring and mitigation strategies","2020","Hydrocarbon gas emissions from with decommissioned wells are an underreported source of greenhouse gas emissions in oil and gas provinces. The associated emissions may partly counteract efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure. We have developed an approach for assessing methane leakage from marine decommissioned wells based on a combination of existing regional industrial seismic and newly acquired hydroacoustic water column imaging data from the Central North Sea. Here, we present hydroacoustic data which show that 28 out of 43 investigated wells release gas from the seafloor into the water column. This gas release largely depends on the presence of shallow gas accumulations and their distance to the wells. The released gas is likely primarily biogenic methane from shallow sources. In the upper 1,000 m below the seabed, gas migration is likely focused along drilling-induced fractures around the borehole or through non-sealing barriers. Combining available direct measurements for methane release from marine decommissioned wells with our leakage analysis suggests that gas release from investigated decommissioned hydrocarbon wells is a major source of methane in the North Sea (0.9-3.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.7-4.2] kt yr−1 of CH4 for 1,792 wells in the UK sector of the Central North Sea). This means hydrocarbon gas emissions associated with marine hydrocarbon wells are not significant for the global greenhouse gas budget, but have to be considered when compiling regional methane budgets.","methane quantification,well integrity,Central North Sea,Methane leakage,Seismic data,decommissioned wells,Water column imaging data,"
"hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis of ship engine systems","2023","As smart ships are developed, research into engine management through remote monitoring and support from data collected at onshore control centers is being conducted. However, ship engine data collected from various sensors have high dimensions, large measurement errors, few labeled data, and insufficient amounts and quality of data, making it difficult to determine the condition of engines with complex failure modes under various operating environments.This study proposes a hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis (HL-FDD) method that combines domain knowledge of ship engines and advanced data analysis techniques. The developed method extracts key features of reduced dimensions from the original variables (sensors) through an optimal hierarchical clustering and dimension-reduction model, allowing a hierarchy divided into the top (the entire system combining all features), middle (subsystems and feature sets), and bottom (components and sensors) levels. The reduced key features are used to generate robust regression models and dynamic thresholds (prediction intervals) according to the engine load, and dynamic thresholds determine whether the engine’s condition is normal or abnormal. The dynamic thresholds are able to automatically label abnormal conditions of the engine. Once anomalies are detected at the top level, the proposed method can sequentially search for data on features belonging to the middle and bottom hierarchies for detailed fault diagnosis to determine which engine subsystem or component(s) caused the engine fault(s). Actual data collected by ship operators verify the proposed method’s efficiency, reliability, and accuracy.","Optimal hierarchical clustering and dimension reduction,Domain knowledge,Sensor error,Dynamic thresholds,Abnormality labeling,Duel fuel marine engine,"

"maritime shift workers sleepiness detection system with multi-modality cues","2019","Sleepiness has been recognized as a causal factor in many round-the-clock industries. While individuals can subjectively express their momentary sleepiness level, sleepiness-related contextual factors (CF) can influence their perception of sleepiness and cognitive performance. In this paper, the self-reported sleepiness value (vSRS) was improved by transforming it into a kernel density estimate and the assignment of the class's score is done using a likelihood ratio test (IvSRS). We integrated multiple CF and IvSRS to model sleepiness using a Bayesian network (BN). The BN produced a single probability estimate calculated based on the prior and posterior probability of the CF and IvSRS. The results showed IvSRS performed better (p <; 0.05) in classifying sleepiness to three states, compared to non-modified vSRS. Considering each CF and IvSRS as stand alone indicators, integrating all these information under a BN significantly improved the systems performance (p â‰¤ 0.05).

"suitability analysis and revised strategies for marine environmental carbon capture and storage (ccs) monitoring","2021","Environmental monitoring of offshore Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) complexes requires robust methodologies and cost-effective tools to detect, attribute and quantify CO2 leakage in the unlikely event it occurs from a sub-seafloor reservoir. Various approaches can be utilised for environmental CCS monitoring, but their capabilities are often undemonstrated and more detailed monitoring strategies need to be developed. We tested and compared different approaches in an offshore setting using a CO2 release experiment conducted at 120 m water depth in the Central North Sea. Tests were carried out over a range of CO2 injection rates (6 - 143 kg d−1) comparable to emission rates observed from abandoned wells. Here, we discuss the benefits and challenges of the tested approaches and compare their relative cost, temporal and spatial resolution, technology readiness level and sensitivity to leakage. The individual approaches demonstrate a high level of sensitivity and certainty and cover a wide range of operational requirements. Additionally, we refer to a set of generic requirements for site-specific baseline surveys that will aid in the interpretation of the results. Critically, we show that the capability of most techniques to detect and quantify leakage exceeds the currently existing legal requirements.","Monitoring strategy,Leakage detection,Leakage quantification,CCS monitoring,Leakage attribution,Suitability analysis,"

"an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system","2012","Maritime information systems typically offer system features for data collection, information fusion and the automated construction of a basic recognized maritime picture for human operators.

Limited human resources face difficult cognitive challenges in making sense of huge amount of data generated daily by dynamic round-the-clock maritime shipping and port activities. An effective information exploitation system for maritime surveillance and monitoring is expected to be able to augment human-based surveillance and monitoring operations with machine-based computing capabilities to interpret and reason about massive amount of situational information, as well as transforming this knowledge into actionable decision indicators for the human decision makers.

The results using ALOS-PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-Phased Array L-band SAR) data showed substantial improvement in SNR and detection rate.","ALOS-PALSAR,lognormal-CFAR,marine radar,Coherence,radar detection,CFAR,radar clutter,radar backscatter,ship detection algorithm,Marine vehicles,sea surface,ground-based maritime radar,phased array radar,SAR,Synthetic aperture radar,AIS,IMLCC method,synthetic aperture radar,multilook cross correlation,IMLCC algorithm,radar imaging,Correlation,correlated noise,IMLCC,correlation methods,constant false alarm rate,Azimuth,coherence image,Ship detection,MLCC,Visualization,radar polarimetry,Signal to noise ratio,advanced land observing satellite- phased array L-band SAR,ship SNR,backscatter,"
"small maritime target detection using gradient vector field characterization of infrared image","2023","Infrared small maritime target detection under strong ocean waves, a challenging task, plays a key role in maritime distress target search and rescue applications. Many methods based on directionality or gradient properties have proven to perform well for infrared images with heterogeneous scenarios. However, they tend to perform poorly when facing strong ocean wave background, mainly due to the following: 1) infrared images have low signal-to-clutter ratio with low intensity for small targets; 2) some waves have high local contrast that may be similar to or higher than targets. To solve these issues, a new method based on gradient vector field characterization (GVFC) of infrared images is proposed. First, we construct the gradient vector field and coarsely extract suspected targets. Then, gradient vector distribution measure (GVDM) is presented, which comprehensively integrates a synergistic homogeneity test based on Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test with absolute difference standard deviation for gradient direction angle and regression analysis for gradient modulus. The proposed GVDM takes advantage of pixel-level gradient distribution property to further filtrate refined suspected targets. Moreover, gradient modulus horizontal local dissimilarity is proposed to measure the diversity of gradient modulus in horizontal direction between targets and waves, so as to enhance target saliency and suppress residual clutter simultaneously, which achieves preferable performance. Finally, a simple adaptive threshold is applied to confirm targets. Extensive experiments implemented on infrared maritime images with strong ocean waves demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with respect to robustness and detection accuracy.","gradient vector distribution measure,pixel-level gradient distribution property,rescue applications,maritime target detection,radar clutter,strong ocean wave background,strong ocean waves,infrared maritime image,Sea measurements,gradient direction angle,regression analysis,gradient vector field characterization,Ocean waves,ocean waves,Target tracking,object detection,Sparse matrices,feature extraction,target saliency,small target detection,infrared image,suppress residual clutter,infrared maritime images,suspected targets,infrared imaging,maritime distress target search,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,gradient modulus horizontal local dissimilarity,low signal-to-clutter ratio,vertical local dissimilarity,image segmentation,Gradient vector,"
"double-constrained rpca based on saliency maps for foreground detection in automated maritime surveillance","2015","The development of automated video-surveillance applications for maritime environment is a very difficult task due to the complexity of the scenes: moving water, waves, etc. The motion of the objects of interest (i.e. ships or boats) can be mixed with the dynamic behavior of the background (non-regular patterns). In this paper, a double-constrained Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), named SCM-RPCA (Shape and Confidence Map-based RPCA), is proposed to improve the object foreground detection in maritime scenes. The sparse component is constrained by shape and confidence maps both extracted from spatial saliency maps. The experimental results in the UCSD and MarDT data sets indicate a better enhancement of the object foreground mask when compared with some related RPCA methods.","Optical imaging,automated video surveillance application,image enhancement,Matrix decomposition,MarDT data set,Noise,object detection,Shape,Sparse matrices,shape and confidence map based RPCA,saliency map,double-constrained robust principal component analysis,foreground detection,UCSD data set,objectforeground detection,Boats,Minimization,double-constrained RPCA,SCM-RPCA,object foreground enhancement,principal component analysis,video surveillance,"
"a cloud based architecture capable of perceiving and predicting multiple vessel behaviour","2015","Progressively huge amounts of data, tracking vessels during their voyages across the seas, are becoming available, mostly due to the automatic identification system (AIS) that vessels of specific categories are required to carry. These datasets provide detailed insights into the patterns vessels follow, while safely navigating across the globe, under various conditions. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of predicting a vessels future behaviour (position, speed and course), based on events that occur in a predictable pattern, across large map areas. The main concept of this study is to determine if an ANN is capable of inferring the unique behavioural patterns that each vessel follows and successively use this as a means for predicting multiple vessel behaviour into a future point in time. We design, train and implement a proof of concept ANN, as a cloud based web application, with the ability of overlaying predicted short and long term vessel behaviour on an interactive map. Our proposed approach could potentially assist in busy port scheduling, vessel route planning, anomaly detection and increasing overall Maritime Domain Awareness.","Vessel behaviour prediction,Soft computing applications,Artificial Neural Network,Automated identification system,Maritime Domain Awareness,"
"remote sensing annual dynamics of rapid permafrost thaw disturbances with landtrendr","2022","Permafrost is warming globally which leads to widespread permafrost thaw. Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1×106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very high-resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at large-scale for 2001–2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158ha, 2001–2019: 66,699ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatio-temporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.","Landsat,Sentinel-2,Time series,Permafrost thaw,Multi-spectral analysis,Thermo-erosion,Retrogressive thaw slumps,"

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"
"chapter 3 - environmental applications of remote sensing","2021","Remote sensing, the science and technology through which characteristics and properties of targets on Earth can be identified and determined from a distance, has provided systematic, dedicated, and repetitive observations of the Earth's surface (atmosphere, water, land, living species, vegetation, pollution, climate) from global to local scales. Satellite observations have contributed to the spectacular improvement of the accuracy of weather forecasts over the last few decades. Remote sensing has provided the means for detecting and quantifying the rates of pollution, and mapping and monitoring sources of pollution and the degree of remediation for their management. It has the means to respond and facilitate environmental management, and makes sound and evidence-based decisions in relation to Earth's resources at a global scale and across different continents, nations, and domains. Remote sensing currently supplies essential Earth observations to protect irreplaceable resources and provide support for sustainable economic growth, disaster resilience, management of energy and mineral resources, food and water security, and sustainability. It provides powerful tools for understanding the past and present conditions of Earth systems and components, as well as the interplay between them. Thus remote sensing could assist us to solve environmental problems, address and mitigate risks, and deliver skillful predictions of the future behaviors of Earth systems (natural disasters, state of oceans, atmosphere, land, vegetation, food, public health, etc.). And by translating these Earth observations into decision making, remote sensing could help mobilize actions to mitigate effects to the benefit of human race.","Electromagnetic radiation and sensing,Marine debris,Unmanned aerial systems,Environmental applications,Remote sensing,Imaging and non-imaging systems,Active and passive detectors,Satellite sensors,Altimeters,Image quality,Earth observation,"
"chapter 5 - oil spill remote sensing","2017","Remotesensing for oil spills is reviewed. The technical aspects of sensors are summarized and the benefits and limitations of each sensor are given. The use of visible techniques is ubiquitous; however, it gives only the same results as visible monitoring. Oil has no particular spectral features that would allow for identification among the many possible background interferences. Identification of specific oil types is not possible. Cameras are useful to provide documentation. Infrared (IR) offers some potential as an oil spill sensor. In daytime oil absorbs light and remits a portion of this as thermal energy at temperatures 3–4K above ambient. IR cameras are economical; however, they suffer from problems such as the inability to discriminate oil from interferences on beaches, among weeds, debris or sediment, and under certain lighting conditions. Furthermore, water-in-oil emulsions may not be detected in the infrared, depending on light and sea conditions. The laser fluorosensor is a useful instrument because of its unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, weeds, ice, and snow. It is the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. The laser fluorosensor also allows for positive identification and discrimination between oil types. Radar detects oil on water because oil dampens water-surface capillary waves under low to moderate wave/wind conditions. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches, day/night and foul weather remote sensing. False targets can be as high as 95%. Satellite-borne radar sensors are now extensively used for mapping large spills or assisting in ship and platform discharge monitoring. The only commercial equipment that measures slick thickness is passive microwave.","Oil spill remote sensing,Oil detection,Sensors for oil,"

"new insight into internal waves for maritime applications: a novel optical method with ocean experimental results","2021","Internal waves generated by the movement of surface and subsurface vehicles in the ocean have specific importance in maritime applications. These types of waves are categorized as forced internal waves. In this article, an attempt using a novel optical method is made to study the forced internal waves that are generated by a large surface vehicle in a controlled sea exercise. The optical method uses a diode laser operating at 635 nm and a lateral-effect position-sensitive photodetector. The laser beam undergoes modulation in both its intensity and beam positions with respect to the density variations that are caused in the stratified ocean by the forced internal waves. The experimental scheme, the system aspect of the optical method, and supporting theoretical aspects are detailed with corroborating experimental results. It is observed that the frequency of the forced internal waves also remains within the band of naturally occurring ambient oscillations in the ocean. The obtained results indicate that the forced internal waves detected by the optical method can be used for detecting the movement of maritime vehicles in the ocean.","lateral-effect position-sensing photodetector,optical method,maritime vehicles movement,remotely operated vehicles,Surface waves,Measurement by laser beam,Optical sensors,ocean waves,lateral-effect position-sensitive photodetector,photodetectors,laser beam,Internal waves,diode laser,semiconductor lasers,maritime applications,laser beams,laser beam deflection,Laser beams,naturally occurring ambient oscillations,naval anti-submarine warfare (ASW) applications,forced internal waves,Refractive index,ocean optics,wavelength 635.0 nm,oceanographic techniques,ocean experimental results,"
"examining ground and surface water changes in response to environmental variables, land use dynamics, and socioeconomic changes in canada","2022","Canada's abundant and high-quality water resources support a growing human population, as well as thriving industrial and agricultural economies. However, recent intense drought conditions have raised concerns for current water resource availability. Patterns of long-term ground and surface water (GSW) changes, and their response to environmental conditions, land-use dynamics, and socioeconomic changes are not well-understood across this large and diverse country. To address this crucial gap, we identified regions of ground and surface water (GSW) changes in all the Provinces of Canada between 2002 and 2016 from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets. We explored the relationships between GSW changes and environmental, socioeconomic, and land-use dynamics over time. We found that all the Provinces of Canada gained a net 4.46 mm Liquid Water Equivalent (LWE) per year, equivalent to a total increase of 66.9 mm LWE. GSW increases were significantly associated with the normalized difference vegetation index and evapotranspiration rates. In contrast, GSW declines were significantly related to deforestation rate, urban expansion, and economic development (median household income). Despite apparent widespread post-drought recovery detected from 2002 to 2016, the rapid GSW declines were also observed in almost all of Western Canada and part of Ontario, amounting to a net loss of 66.13 mm. This indicates that a pronounced drought had emerged. It is anticipated that Canada will be experiencing more frequent and severe droughts under ongoing climate change and increasing demand for water resources.","Environment issues,Drought,Canada,Ground and surface water changes,Land use dynamics,"

"potential-field data in integrated frontier basin geophysics: successes and challenges on australia's continental margin","2015","Offshore frontier sedimentary basins are characterised by a lack of constraining geological and geophysical data. This lack of data is generally the result of deep water (>500 m), difficult geology (volcanics and salt), remoteness and harsh met–ocean conditions. These characteristics present significant challenges to marine surveying, which means that frontier basins tend to be underexplored. With continuing interest in exploration for energy resources in frontier regions, many frontier basins around the world have been the focus of increasingly-sophisticated geophysical studies that integrate a range of methodologies, including those based on potential-field (gravity and magnetic) data. Underexplored frontier basins around Australia's continental margin have received increased attention during the last decade, largely as a result of government-funded programs of precompetitive data acquisition and analysis. The components of this work that have relied heavily on potential-field data include: first-pass depth-to-basement estimation using spectral techniques applied to magnetic data; enhancement of gravity and magnetic images to aid the identification of basin depocentres and to facilitate onshore–offshore geological interpretation of basement structure; multi-scale edge-detection applied to gravity and magnetic data to aid the interpretation of basement structure; 3D forward and stochastic inverse modelling of gravity data to guide seismic interpretation of sediment thickness and basement structure; and using supercomputers for high-resolution, regional-scale 3D inverse modelling of magnetic and gravity data to constrain the physical properties of the crust. Despite the additional insight offered by this work, efforts to understand frontier basins are not without challenges, one of the most fundamental of which is to ensure that non-specialists are not misinterpreting data (e.g. wrongly interpreting artefacts arising from specific processing). The other main challenge in Australian frontier basins arises from a lack of constraints on crustal structure. This leads to significant ambiguity when using gravity data to infer sediment thickness or to understand the nature of basement. This ambiguity could be vastly reduced through the acquisition of seismic refraction data that focuses on imaging crustal structure. Further opportunities exist in using alternative methods for automated depth-to-basement estimation, incorporating process-oriented rather than static potential-field modelling, and in applying 3D forward and inverse gravity and magnetic modelling to other Australian frontier basins.","Frontier basin,Petroleum exploration,Geophysics,Continental margin,"

"decoding the mechanism of formation in marine ooids: a review","2019","Ooid shoals, sedimentary structures consisting of carbonate grains, are often used as proxies to explore changes in seawater chemistry over Earth history. Despite their importance as contributors to the global carbonate budget and as paleo-environmental indicators for water depth, pH, temperature and water energy, the mechanism of formation of these concentric, sub-spherical concretions of tangentially or radially arranged aragonite or calcite crystals is still the subject of intense debate. Unlike oncoids, whose microbial origins are well acknowledged, ooids are traditionally viewed as abiotic grains, mainly produced in suspension by agitated, warm waters that are supersaturated with respect to CaCO3. Yet, there is considerable evidence, including geochemical bio-signatures and detection of viable microbes capable of mineralization and biofilm production and degradation, to suggest otherwise. The emergence of new and sophisticated technologies reveals that the level of microbial diversity of these sedimentary grains exceeds that of some microbialite systems. These findings have refined our understanding of ooid genesis and ooid accretion processes and argue toward microbial mediation both as a direct result of metabolic activities inducing changes in the environment conducive to precipitation and by a passive mechanism, in which mucilaginous extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) act as a template for mineral nucleation. Furthermore, new developments in the field indicate that carbonate mineralization in marine ooids occurs through sequential precipitations that involve an amorphous calcium carbonate phase (ACC), which some argue are of biotic origins. Herein, we discuss the most relevant theories of ooid formation, including some of the early pioneering studies that laid the groundwork for new theories attempting to decode the origins of these controversial grains.","Organomineralization,Ooids,Amorphous calcium carbonate,Microbial metabolism,EPS,Carbonate precipitation,Microbe-mineral interactions,"

"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert.

"fault detection with lstm-based variational autoencoder for maritime components","2021","Maintenance routines on ships today follow either a reactive maintenance (RM) or preventive maintenance (PvM) approach. RM can be regarded as post-failure repair, which might create large costs. PvM uses predetermined maintenance intervals, which often involves unnecessary maintenance. Recently, prognostics and health management (PHM) has emerged as a potential way to develop an ideal maintenance policy. PHM aims to provide optimal maintenance schedule through the use of sensor measurement for fault detection and fault prognostics, among which fault detection is the first and fundamental action. In this paper, a long-short term memory based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) is proposed for fault detection of maritime components onboard. It is a semi-supervised approach that requires only fault-free data for training. Therefore, it is widely applicable in the maritime industry since operational data in normal conditions already exists.

This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.",""
"maritime smuggling detection and mitigation using risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks","2017","With the rise of more resourceful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), their inclusion into robotic sensor networks (RSNs) is inevitable. The highly mobile nature of UAVs allows greater monitoring capabilities, making them most suitable for RSNs. Compared to traditional nodes in RSNs, UAVs suffer even more from communication disruptions and energy depletion, must often rapidly determine actions for themselves, and consequently require more autonomy. Prior work has been done in wireless sensor network (WSN)/aerial sensor network (ASN) coordination in a few applications such as protecting critical infrastructure, restoring communication between nodes, and healing networks, while other work has been accomplished on using the UAV network for augmenting the monitoring capabilities of WSNs. We introduce a novel methodology to integrate UAVs into RSNs for monitoring purposes by formulating the problem in the context of a risk management framework (RMF). This methodology allows a more precise risk feature classification and a more efficient task allocation for the ground network by utilizing the monitoring capabilities of the UAVs to informatively warn the RSN of any incoming events. We also present a fictitious but credible maritime smuggling scenario near the Port of Barcelona based on expert knowledge, and apply the methodology to detect and mitigate maritime smuggling. The network's behaviour is traced throughout the scenario and is repeated with civilian ships to assure that they are not flagged as smugglers. The applied methodology results in a successful classification and mitigation of the smuggling activity.","unmanned aerial vehicles,network healing,Risk management,risk feature classification,network behaviour,wireless sensor network,Marine vehicles,Wireless sensor networks,Monitoring,critical infrastructure protection,smuggling activity,Resource management,monitoring,Biological cells,task allocation,Robot sensing systems,aerial sensor network,wireless sensor networks,police,WSN-ASN coordination,maritime smuggling detection,pattern classification,communication disruption,critical infrastructures,autonomous aerial vehicles,energy depletion,ground network,maritime smuggling mitigation,monitoring capability,Port of Barcelona,risk management framework,civilian ships,UAV network,risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks,"
"transcriptomic profiling reveals the neuroendocrine-disrupting effect and toxicity mechanism of tbbpa-dhee exposure in zebrafish (danio rerio) during sexual development","2023","TBBPA bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (TBBPA-DHEE) pollution in the environment has raised serious public health concerns due to its potential neuroendocrine-disrupting effects. The neuroendocrine-disrupting effects of TBBPA-DHEE on marine spices, on the other hand, have received little attention. The behavioral, neuroendocrine-disrupting, and possible reproductive toxicity of TBBPA-DHEE were assessed in sexual developing zebrafish treated for 40 days by examining locomotor activity, Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and quantifying gene expression. In addition, transcriptome profiling was carried out to explore the possible mechanisms. According to our findings, TBBPA-DHEE treated zebrafish showed altered locomotor activity, a potential neuroendocrine-disrupting effect via the toxic effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which is evident in decreased levels of GnRH, FSH, and LH, according to our findings. The transcriptomic profiling reveals that a total of 216 DEGs were detected (5 upregulated and 211 down-regulated). Transcriptomic analysis shows that TBBPA-DHEE exposure caused decreased transcript levels of genes (cyp11a1, ccna1, ccnb2, ccnb1, cpeb1b, wee2) involved in cell cycle oocyte meiosis, progesterone mediated oocyte maturation, and ovarian steroidogenesis, which are known reproduction-related pathways. Overall, these findings add to our understanding of the impact of TBBPA-DHEE and biomonitoring in the maritime environment.","Reproductive toxicity,TBBPA-DHEE,Zebrafish,Transcriptomics,Locomotor behavior,Neuroendocrine-disruption,"

"wondering about wandering whiting: distribution of north sea whiting between the 1920s and 2000s","2013","The responses of fish populations to anthropogenic and environmental drivers are of growing interest. In commercial fisheries attention is increasingly directed to species historically being of secondary importance and potentially being influenced by these drivers. We present long-term commercial fisheries data of North Sea whiting (Merlangius merlangus), comprising international catches (1903–2010), quotas (1980–2010), and British otter trawler data (landings-per-unit-effort (lpue) for 1923–2009 at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles). Based on lpue data, we tested the possible effects of climate change and fishing pressure on whiting distribution. Results showed no distinct latitudinal and deepening shifts, but a ∼1° westward shift between the late-1940s and 1960s. Relations to climate change and fishing pressure were not strong. The lack of clear latitudinal and deepening shifts contrasts with recent studies on other North Sea species reporting such shifts related to temperature change. The North Sea is at the centre of the distribution range of whiting, and the temperature changes might still fall well within the physiological tolerance limits of this species, hence not affecting the distribution. The drivers for the longitudinal shift remain unclear. However, whiting is also commonly discarded by fisheries; if levels of discarding differ spatially, our results may not represent the true picture of whiting distribution and need to be interpreted with caution. This highlights the challenge in detection and attribution of climate change effects on exploited fish stocks with commercial data only.","North Sea,Fishing,Climate,Distribution,Whiting,"

"location estimation in a maritime environment using a monocular camera","2014","Maritime surveillance is a very important task in coastal areas, especially in harbour environments. The most popular such systems include components like Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Radar. Camera based visual surveillance can be used as an alternative to these systems in order to overcome the lacking features of them. Sea surface object detection and identification is a major need for such visual surveillance systems. Most of the current visual surveillance systems don't have the ability of identifying vessels in real time. A vessel can be identified using information from other systems, if the location of the vessel is identified. Location estimation of sea surface objects is mainly explored in this research. Video stream from a single geo stationary camera is used as the input; however camera properties are not used for any calculation. Mainly two distance measurements are considered and different approaches for estimating the distances are explored. Neural network approach gave considerably accurate results in vertical distance estimation and it was found that the shortest distance from camera to the object can be measured best using B-spline 3D curve fitting. Data taken from AIS is used for fitting curves and training neural network. After calculating distances, latitudes and longitudes are calculated. An evaluation has been done comparing the calculated values and the values obtained from AIS data using various statistical tests. There, the different approaches are compared and accuracy levels are described.

"online ddos attack detection using mahalanobis distance and kernel-based learning algorithm","2020","Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are constantly evolving as the computer and networking technologies and attackers' motivations are changing. In recent years, several supervised DDoS detection algorithms have been proposed. However, these algorithms require a priori knowledge of the classes and cannot automatically adapt to frequently changing network traffic trends. This emphasizes the need for the development of new DDoS detection mechanisms that target zero-day and sophisticated DDoS attacks. In this paper, we propose an online, sequential, DDoS detection scheme that is suitable for use with multivariate data. The proposed algorithm utilizes a kernel-based learning algorithm, the Mahalanobis distance, and a chi-square test. Initially, we extract four entropy-based and four statistical features from network flows per minute as detection metrics. Then, we employ the kernel-based learning algorithm using the entropy features to detect input vectors that were suspected to be DDoS. This algorithm assumes no model for network traffic or DDoS. It constructs and adapts a dictionary of features that approximately span the subspace of normal behavior. Every T minutes, the Mahalanobis distance between suspicious vectors and the distribution of dictionary members is measured. Subsequently, the chi-square test is used to evaluate the Mahalanobis distance. The proposed DDoS detection scheme was applied to the CICIDS2017 dataset, and we compared the results with those given by existing algorithms. It was demonstrated that the proposed online detection scheme outperforms almost all available DDoS classification algorithms with an offline learning process.","KOAD,Mahalanobis distance,Online learning algorithm,DDoS,Chi-square test,E-KOAD,"

We presented results for the 2000–2008 period concerning the trend analysis for ambient ozone concentrations and related forest damages, with the Mann and seasonal Kendall tests. Ozone precursor’s emissions from Europe have been reduced over the last 20 years. Decreases in annual averages, median, 25th and 98th percentiles and maxima values were found. The seasonal trend analysis for the high-lying stations showed a decreasing trend for the warm season, when main ozone production is the photochemistry, and an increase for the cold period, caused by a reduced ozone titration. Statistics on Arolla Pine reveal strong correlations between mottling intensity and the high ozone concentrations. Finally, decreases for the ozone concentrations, and associated statistics, AOT40 values and for the mottling intensity on conifers needles were observed.","Ozone,Leaf injury,Mann–Kendall test,Chlorotic mottle,Trend,Arolla pine,AOT40,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data. The LSTM-based reconstruction method is able to take full advantage of the similar geometrical features behind massive vessel trajectories.

"an early holocene westerly minimum in the southern mid-latitudes","2021","An important coupled ocean-atmospheric system in the mid- and high latitudes involves the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) and the Southern Ocean (SO), which controls climate in the southernmost third of the world, deep water formation, and ventilation of CO2 from the deep ocean. Most studies have examined its role as a driver of atmospheric CO2 concentrations during glacial terminations, but very few have investigated its influence during the Holocene, i.e. the current interglacial. A fundamental problem, however, is resolving whether the SWW strength increased or declined during the early Holocene (∼11.5–7.5 ka, ka = 1000 cal yr BP) in sectors adjacent to the Drake Passage. Here we assess past changes in SWW influence over the last ∼17,000 years using terrestrial paleoclimate records from southwestern Patagonia (∼52°S). We detect a zonally symmetric Early Holocene Westerly Minimum which diminished wind stress and upwelling on the SO, contributing to a contemporary decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enrichment in the stable carbon isotope ratio of atmospheric CO2 (δ13Catm). Our mid-latitude data also indicate a shift to strong SWW influence at ∼7.5 ka which correlates with a sustained increase in atmospheric CO2 and halt in the δ13Catm rise, suggesting enhancement of high-latitude ocean ventilation by an invigorated SWW-SO coupled system.","Southern middle latitudes,Early holocene westerly minimum,Southern westerly winds,Southwestern patagonia,Atmospheric CO2 holocene,"
"shipping and ship recycling related oil pollution detection in çandarlı bay (turkey) using satellite monitoring","2019","Çandarlı Bay is a marine environment at risk of heavy pollution because of industrial facilities including the only ship recycling zone of Turkey, and intense marine traffic related to the raw materials needs of a dense industrial zone. These risk factors make the development of practical environmental management strategies increasingly necessary. Oil spills from the heavy ship traffic, one of the major risks, can be detected by satellite remote sensing technologies. In this study, it is aimed to show spatial characteristics of oil spills as well as its dynamics in the time domain of the bay. Results from a three year period of the study show that as a main environmental problem, oil pollution has a relatively high percentage of spatial distribution in the bay. It is therefore concluded that regular monitoring of the intense oil pollution in the bay is required with an agile and low-cost method of satellite monitoring to intervene in good time and to minimize its impacts. The study provided an extensive understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of oil pollution in the bay. The approach used will also provide a baseline for decision-makers to develop environmental management plans for other coastal zones with similar sensitivities.","The synthetic radar monitoring (SAR),Ship recycling,Spatio-temporal analysis,Çandarlı Bay (Turkey),Oil pollution from ships,"

"long-term trends in daily extreme air temperature indices in ireland from 1885 to 2018","2022","Long-term instrumental series are crucial to analyse extreme air temperature indices and to examine modern climate warming within a historical context. This research provides the first assessment in Ireland of the frequency, duration, intensity and geographical distribution of the daily extreme air temperature indices recommended by the ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) and based on long-term rescued, quality-controlled and homogenised data. Prior analysis of air temperature indices in Ireland had focused on the period since the second half of the 20th century, where digital data were readily available. Earlier estimations of long-term air temperature trends in Ireland focused on non-homogenised data from a small network of stations. For this research, 11 long-term (1885–2018) maximum and minimum air temperature series were analysed to assess seasonal and annual trends and construct extreme air temperature indices in Ireland. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was employed to test the statistical significance of the maximum and minimum air temperatures and indices trends (p < 0.05). Significant increasing trends were assessed in the seasonal and annual maximum and minimum air temperature series in Ireland, with greater increases in the spring and autumn seasons. Significant increasing trends were determined in the warm days (+6.8 days), warm nights (+7.5 nights), warm spell duration index (+3.9 days), growing season length (+22 days), coldest night (+2.7 °C) and coldest day (+1.5 °C) in the period 1885–2018 in Ireland. In the same period, significant decreasing trends were identified in the cold days (−9.3 days), cold nights (−7 nights), frost days (−13.7 days), cold spell duration index (−6.9 days) and diurnal air temperature range (−0.1 °C) in Ireland. The results follow global patterns presented in the Six Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The findings of this research will be crucial to assist stakeholders and policymakers in defining climate action, adaptation and mitigation plans in response to shifting trends in air temperature extremes.","Air temperature trends,Historical weather extremes,Ireland,Extreme air temperature indices,Climate change,"

The ability of USVs to autonomously and effectively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic and uncertain marine environments is a prerequisite for the successful completion of their tasks.

Based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) and common practices of seafarers, an improved ship collision risk model is proposed. Specifically, the model is innovatively combined with the differential evolution algorithm (DE) as a constraint condition to further realize path planning in complex situations. Moreover, chaotic multi-population parallel optimization, parameter adaptive adjustment strategy, and the construction of fitness function based on individual path points are added to the DE. In this way, the ability to escape from local optima and enrich population diversity can be guaranteed. Finally, experiments based on the proposed CRI-DE are conducted and the results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Collision risk model,Path planning,Multi-ship collision avoidance,Improved differential evolution algorithm,"

In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.",""

The electro-optical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complements radar and sonar for situational awareness at sea and has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction, and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The key processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background, and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors.

"magnetic susceptibility and heavy-metal contamination in topsoils along the izmit gulf coastal area and izaytas (turkey)","2010","The study on topsoil contamination due to heavy metals was carried out by using the Magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurements in Izmit industrial city, northern Turkey. We attempted to investigate correlations between the concentration of selected heavy metals and the MS from 41 sample sites around Izmit Gulf. These investigations let us quantify and standardize the MS method, which may have consequences for long term monitoring of anthropogenic pollution, especially in urban areas. The MS surfer contour map based on the topsoil measurements was compiled with a randomly ranged distance density. The soil samples collected throughout the industrial areas, the parks, road sides and residential areas were also analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Heavy metals Cu, Ni, Cr and Pb show strong correlations with MS, while Zn and Co show a weak correlation with MS. Moreover, the Tomlinson pollution load index (PLI) shows insignificant correlation with the MS. The MS was examined vertically (0–30cm) with respect to anthropogenic and/or lithogenic influences at the fourteen sample sites. The maximum values were mostly observed in depths of 2–5cm and the MS values on the depth profiles vary between 10×10−8m3kg−1 and 203×10−8m3kg−1. The study revealed that MS is an inexpensive, fast and non-destructive method for the detection and mapping of contaminated soils.","Heavy metals,Izmit,Magnetic susceptibility,Turkiye,Soil contamination,"

"an adaptive network security system for iot-enabled maritime transportation","2023","With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), cyber-attacks and challenges in data safety have also increased extensively. Meanwhile, the IoT devices are resource-constrained and cannot implement the existing security systems, making them susceptible to various types of debilitating cyber-attacks. The dynamics in the attack processes in IoT-enabled MTS networks keep changing, which makes a traditional offline or batch ML-based attack detection systems intractable to apply. This paper provides a novel approach of using an adaptive incremental passive-aggressive machine learning (AI-PAML) method to create a network attack detection system (NADS) to protect the IoT devices in an MTS environment. In this paper, we propose an NADS that utilizes a multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform to provide computational resources to execute the proposed model at a network end. Since online learning models face data saturation problems, we present an improved approximate linear dependence and a modified hybrid forgetting mechanism to filter the inefficient data and keep the detection model up-to-date. The proposed data filtering ensures that the model does not experience a rapid increase in unwarranted data, which affects the modelâ€™s attack detection rate. A Markov transition probability is applied to control the MEC selection and data offloading process by the IoT devices. The performance of the NADS is verified using selected benchmark datasets and a realistic IoT environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AI-PAML achieves remarkable performance in the NADS design for an MTS environment.","Markov processes,computer network security,resource-constrained,Internet of Things,Things applications,network attack detection system,unwarranted data,network end,multi-access edge computing,NADS,inefficient data,passive-aggressive machine,Servers,Performance evaluation,cloud computing,IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation,intrusion detection,traditional offline,Data models,edge computing,realistic IoT environment,multiaccess edge computing platform,detection model,existing security systems,Maritime Transportation Systems,task offloading,online learning models,debilitating cyber-attacks,data saturation problems,adaptive network security system,attack detection rate,IoT devices,IoT-enabled MTS networks,computational resources,Sensors,Task analysis,data safety,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,maritime transport system,"

The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. Improvement to the associative learning law for learning temporal associations between vessel events enables conditional probabilities between events to be learned incrementally and locally. This allows weights in the learned model to be interpreted more readily, enabling better location prediction performance. Improvement in prediction performance is achieved by using multiple spatial scales to represent position, enabling the most relevant spatial scale to be used for local vessel behavior.

"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"
"mkcl: medical knowledge with contrastive learning model for radiology report generation","2023","Automatic radiology report generation has the potential to alert inexperienced radiologists to misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses and improve healthcare delivery efficiency by reducing the documentation workload of radiologists. Motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. However, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. Additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge with Contrastive Learning model (MKCL) to enhance radiology report generation. The proposed model MKCL uses IU Medical Knowledge Graph (IU-MKG) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. In particular, we design Knowledge Enhanced Attention (KEA), which integrates the IU-MKG and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias. Meanwhile, this paper leverages supervised contrastive learning to relieve radiographic medical images which have not been labeled, and identify abnormalities from images. Experimental results on the public dataset IU X-ray show that our proposed model MKCL outperforms other state-of-the-art report generation methods.

"feature enhancement and supervised contrastive learning for image splicing forgery detection","2023","Image forgery detection remains a challenging task due to the variation in the scale of the tampered areas and the forensic clues that are obscured by various post-processing operations. Most existing deep learning methods rely only on single-scale high-level features and ignore the correlations of the pixels in intra-image and inter-image. Due to this limitation, previous methods are considered unsuitable for multi-scale splicing forgery detection. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model for improving multi-scale splicing forged regions localization by utilizing multi-level multi-scale feature enhancement and pixel-level supervised contrastive learning. First, we introduce a multi-level multi-scale feature enhancement module (MFEM) to integrate the multi-level information and capture the multi-scale global contextual representation by embedding an improved atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) mechanism into the non-local module. It strengthens the capability of the model to sense multi-scale tampered regions. Second, the pixel-level supervised contrastive learning mechanism is designed to separately cluster the pixel representations of tampered and real regions within and across images. It improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of the pixel embedding space significantly and enhances feature expression capabilities. Third, we design a multi-loss progressive learning (MPL) strategy to integrate the complementary advantages of multi-loss functions to optimize the scale and position parameters of the tampered regions during the training process. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It can effectively detect and segment multi-scale tampered regions, even for noisy and JPEG-compressed images.","Supervised contrastive learning,Feature enhancement,Global contextual representations,Image forgery,"

"fusion of camera-based vessel detection and ais for maritime surveillance","2021","Camera-based vessel identification is one of the essential maritime surveillance measures. The existing deep learning (DL)-based vessel classification methods have challenges in achieving the detailed vessel information (e.g., vessel identity) under poor visual conditions.

This paper proposed a fusion framework, which takes the visual detection and the automatic identification system (AIS) as inputs to obtain accurate and robust vessel identification to address these challenges. Visual detection uses an innovative method to estimate the distance of the identified vessel target from the camera and the azimuth angle relative to the camera based on the images from the monocular camera. The distance and azimuth angle were further fused with AIS data to obtain the fused output.

"applications of shapelet transform to time series classification of earthquake, wind and wave data","2021","Autonomous detection of desired events from large databases using time series classification is becoming increasingly important in civil engineering as a result of continued long-term health monitoring of a large number of engineering structures encompassing buildings, bridges, towers, and offshore platforms. In this context, this paper proposes the application of a relatively new time series representation named “Shapelet transform”, which is based on local similarity in the shape of the time series subsequences. In consideration of the individual attributes distinctive to time series signals in earthquake, wind and ocean engineering, the application of this transform yields a new shape-based feature representation. Combining this shape-based representation with a standard machine learning algorithm, a truly “white-box” machine learning model is proposed with understandable features and a transparent algorithm. This model automates event detection without the intervention of domain practitioners, yielding a practical event detection procedure. The efficacy of this proposed shapelet transform-based autonomous detection procedure is demonstrated by examples, to identify known and unknown earthquake events from continuously recorded ground-motion measurements, to detect pulses in the velocity time history of ground motions to distinguish between near-field and far-field ground motions, to identify thunderstorms from continuous wind speed measurements, to detect large-amplitude wind-induced vibrations from the bridge monitoring data, and to identify plunging breaking waves that have a significant impact on offshore structures.","Time series shapelets,Shapelet transform,Thunderstorm classification,Earthquake detection,Time series classification,Machine learning,Breaking wave detection,"

The connection between the main forcing factors and the major circulation patterns is also under investigation. The interannual analysis of the collected data revealed the existence of strong seasonal fluctuations that present significant deviations from a mean seasonal pattern in specific periods. A general decreasing trend of the salinities of the domain is observed during the study period. At the same time, a strong relation between open Aegean Sea waters and riverine freshwater fluxes is identified, factors that significantly influence stratification, circulation and renewal of the gulf.

"functional outlier detection in grain-size distribution curves of detrital sediments","2013","This article introduces functional outlier detection as a mathematical tool for the recognition of outliers in grain-size distribution curves. Two methods, namely the functional high density region (HDR) boxplot and functional bagplot, were applied for outlier detection in detrital sediment grain-size curves. The results of these two approaches were compared with those obtained with a classical modified z-score method. In this regard, while the HDR and functional bagplots revealed a significant number of curves as outliers, the former showed superior sensitivity. Despite the visual appreciation of differences between the curves produced by the classical method, this technique was not able to detect outliers on the basis of just one characteristic parameter of the curves (the median in our case). None of the sedimentary structures (eolian and tidal) addressed was detected as outliers by the algorithms, thus these structures were incorporated into natural variability. The results suggest that the HDR bagplot and the functional bagplot could be introduced as a preceding outlier detection step in geochemical, sedimentological and coastal studies.","Outlier detection,Functional bagplot,Coastal sediments,Functional high density region (HDR) boxplot,Grain-size curves,"

The representation and analysis of the transient response in the frequency domain is an attractive approach for fault detection due to its high noise tolerance and the linearized equations allows for the clear analytical characterization of system behaviour. Recent studies have demonstrated that an extended partial constriction of the pipe flow area causes changes in the system resonant frequencies and these changes can be used for locating and sizing partial blockages in pipes. Despite the successful application of this technique under field conditions, so far there is little work on the link between the changes in the system resonant conditions and the wave-blockage interaction. This paper provides a fundamental basis for the observation that unlike localised, discrete blockages, an extended blockage creates changes in the system resonant frequencies. Analytical methods using wave perturbation analysis and transfer matrix are shown in this study, and the obtained results are compared with numerical simulations and experimental data. The analytical analyses are used to explain the blockage-induced frequency shifts and to provide insights for its practical applications in pressurized water pipelines.","transfer matrix,resonant frequency shift,Transients,water pipeline,wave perturbation analysis,wave-blockage interaction,"
"loitering behavior detection and classification of vessel movements based on trajectory shape and convolutional neural networks","2022","To improve the ability of ship behavior detection in maritime safety surveillance, a new ship behavior of frequent turning within a certain spatial range, called ship loitering, was found under the ship behavior framework of 'anchored-off, straight-sailing, turning'. The concept of trajectory redundancy is defined as the quantitative representation of trajectory characteristics of ship loitering. A multi-scale sliding window-based ship loitering detection method is designed to process ship trajectories with different spatial ranges and time duration. Further, a shape recognition model based on a convolutional neural network is constructed and trained to identify four typical shapes of loitering trajectories. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the AIS trajectory data collected from the sea off the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the eastern North Pacific Ocean in 2017 and validated against the manual labeling results. The results illustrate that six general categories of ships produce loitering behaviors with different intentions. The characteristics of the spatial-temporal distribution of ship loitering behaviors can be represented as different shapes. The average precision of ship loitering detection reaches 96.5% and the average accuracy of four typical loitering trajectory shapes reaches 86.2%.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Loitering behavior,Ship trajectory,Automatic identification system (AIS),Sliding window,"
"distributed adaptive time slot allocation for wimax based maritime wireless mesh networks","2009","We envisage extending radio coverage of the existing terrestrial wireless broadband networks to the sea to provide ships with cost-efficient high-speed connection to the Internet. This is achieved by forming a WiMAX based maritime wireless mesh network where ships are network nodes connected to the land station across multiple hops. In such a maritime wireless mesh network, time slot allocation is an important issue as it affects the performance in terms of throughout and delay. This papers proposes a distributed adaptive time slot allocation (DATSA) scheme for WiMAX mesh MAC protocol. DATSA is a distributed scheme that allocates time slots robustly by taking into consideration difference between radio reception range and interference range, and latency in scheduling control messages. DATSA has a method to monitor reception quality of an allocated time slot, in order to detect the effect of topology changes due to ship mobility, etc. Based on the monitoring outcome, the method adaptively changes the time slot allocation if necessary. We have evaluated DATSA through random event simulation using QualNet. The simulation results confirm that DATSA outperforms the original WiMAX mesh MAC protocol that has no adaptive time slot allocation, in terms of throughput, average packet delay, and packet delivery ratio.","WiMAX mesh MAC protocol,terrestrial wireless broadband network,Robust control,Wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,distributed adaptive time slot allocation,radio reception range,IP networks,interference range,maritime wireless mesh network,ship mobility,access protocols,telecommunication network topology,Delay effects,Media Access Protocol,Broadband communication,radiofrequency interference,broadband networks,radio reception,marine communication,WiMAX,Interference,Internet,WiMax,"
"tide-related variability of tag hydrothermal activity observed by deep-sea monitoring system and obsh","1997","Hydrothermal activities were monitored by an ocean bottom seismometer with hydrophone (OBSH) and a composite measuring system (Manatee) including CTD, current meter, transmission meter and cameras at a small depression on the TAG hydrothermal mound in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Low-frequency pressure pulses detected by the hydrophone with semi-diurnal periodicity seem to correspond to cycles of hydrothermal upflow from a small and short-lived smoker vent close to the observing site. The peaks of pressure pulses are synchronous with the maximum gradient of areal strain decrease due to tidal load release. Microearthquakes with very near epicenters occur sporadically and do not appear to be directly correlatable to hydrothermal venting. Temporal variations in bottom water temperature also have semi-diurnal periodicity but are more complicated than the pressure events. Temperatures may be affected both by upwelling of hot water and by lateral flow of the bottom current changing its directions with ocean tide.","TAG hydrothermal field,diurnal variations,black smokers,tides,hydrothermal conditions,"
"adaptation to the clutter environment by airborne maritime surveillance radars","2001","Airborne maritime surveillance radars must detect small targets against a background of sea clutter whilst maintaining surveillance over a large area of sea. This task is very demanding and requires the radar to dynamically adapt to the local environment in order to obtain the best possible detection sensitivity. An aircraft flying at, say 3000 ft would be able to observe an area of sea of about 49,000 km, with a range to the horizon of about 124 km. Over this area, the clutter characteristics observed the radar will be continuously changing as a function of range and look direction. These characteristics will vary in a manner dependent on the prevailing conditions, the radar characteristics and the viewing geometry. In practice, the radar must cope with a very wide dynamic range of signal amplitude, with amplitude statistics varying from those of thermal noise to very spiky sea clutter and land. Continuous adaptation to this environment is required as a function of range and bearing. The dynamic behaviour of the radar as it adapts in this way is often a much more relevant measure of performance than more traditional static measures such as detection range. Methods used to adapt to the environment are surveyed in this paper, together with indications of how their dynamic behaviour can influence performance.","airborne radar,radar characteristics,sea clutter,military radar,viewing geometry,search radar,airborne maritime surveillance radars,marine radar,signal amplitude,radar detection,prevailing conditions,radar clutter,detection sensitivity,dynamic behaviour,small targets,amplitude statistics,"

"conflictfinder: mining maritime traffic conflict from massive ship trajectories","2017","Collision-free is one of the major safety concerns for maritime traffic management. To analyze the collision data and understand the cause of the collision can contribute the improvement of the maritime traffic safety and management. However, the real collisions is not always available to analyze. Based on a massive AIS trajectory data collected, we focus on mining the ships' movement behaviors those may bring a possible collision if they do not take any avoidance, called Maritime Traffic Conflict. Even though the maritime traffic conflict is a non-accident incident, the movement behaviors of maritime traffic conflict may have the similar behaviors of navigational collision for analysis. Thus, we propose ConflictFinder to provide a framework for maritime traffic conflict mining. Different from existing methods those focus on detecting the conflicts between two ships in a restricted water way, we discover the conflicts occurred by multi-ships in open sea. For analysis of maritime traffic conflicts, a prototype of ConflictFinder is implemented which helps with gaining a better understanding of traffic conflicts discovered and can be applied to the improvement of maritime traffic safety evaluation and management.","AIS Data,data mining,maritime traffic conflict,Safety,Marine vehicles,mining maritime traffic,massive AIS trajectory data,Trajectory Data Mining,massive ship trajectories,ships,collision data analysis,marine safety,maritime traffic safety evaluation,marine engineering,ship movement behaviors,maritime traffic safety management,Prototypes,Artificial intelligence,ConflictFinder,Conflict Detection,Maritime Traffic,Trajectory,navigational collision,restricted water way,open sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,Data mining,collision free,"
"maritime situational awareness forensics tools for a common information sharing environment (cise)","2019","CISE stands for Common Information Sharing Environment and refers to an architecture and set of protocols, procedures and services for the exchange of data and information across Maritime Authorities of EU (European Union) Member States (MS's). In the context of enabling the implementation and adoption of CISE by different MS's, EU has funded a number of projects that enable the development of subsystems and adaptors intended to allow MS's to connect and make use of CISE. In this context, the Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) has led the development of the corresponding Hellenic and Cypriot CISE by developing a Control, Command & Information (C2I) system that unifies all partial maritime surveillance systems into one National Situational Picture Management (NSPM) system, and adaptors that allow the interconnection of the corresponding national legacy systems to CISE and the exchange of data, information and requests between the two MS's. Furthermore, a set of forensics tools that allow geospatial & time filtering and detection of anomalies, risk incidents, fake MMSIs, suspicious speed changes, collision paths, and gaps in AIS (Automatic Identification System), have been developed by combining motion models, AI, deep learning and fusion algorithms using data from different databases through CISE. This paper briefly discusses these developments within the EU CISE-2020, Hellenic CISE and CY-CISE projects and the benefits from the sharing of maritime data across CISE for both maritime surveillance and security.

"chapter 2 - preventing system intrusions","2014","Intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion detection and attempting to stop detected possible incidents. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) focus primarily on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators. In addition, organizations use IPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events, and produce reports. Many IPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack’s content. This chapter describes the characteristics of IPS technologies and provides recommendations for designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining them. The types of IPS technologies are differentiated primarily by the types of events that they monitor and the ways in which they are deployed.","digital attacks,phishing,crackers,intrusion prevention systems,hacker,malware,cybersecurity,daemons,cybercrime,TCP/IP,"
"touchless and nonverbal human-robot interfaces: an overview of the state-of-the-art","2023","Human-robot interfaces encompass developing technologies that determine how a user interacts with robot systems. Touchless and nonverbal interfaces are a subset of these in which the user can interact with robots without the use of buttons, speech, or other physical methods. The two driving forces behind the development of these methods are the desire for more natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and the need for more efficacious assistive technologies. Many interface methods inspired by natural human interaction can improve HRIs. These include gaze/eye contact, emotion detection, and gesture recognition. Assistive robot systems can efficiently utilize these methods, as well as other interfaces that are uncommon in human interactions. These includes several unexplored methods such as biopotential signals, the electroencephalogram (EEG) being one example. Research is also underway in exploring the use of involuntary or subconscious signals in human interaction, such as lie detection or behavior analysis. This paper compiles research findings in several of these areas and discusses the benefits, limitations, and potential for future development in several essential touchless and nonverbal human-robot interface methods. This includes a discussion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices as they relate to how robot systems can gather information through the use of sensors. The paper also examines cognitive robots and explores possible advancements that can be explored in this area using next-generation mobile networking (5G and 6G) to allow for high data transfer rates, highlighting important information gathered by robots through different interfacing methods. This leads to several new avenues of future research.","Cognitive robotics,Electroencephalogram,Internet of things,Assistive robots,Human-robot interaction,"
"maritime detection of radiological/nuclear threats with hybrid imaging system","2013","Improved detection of weapons of mass destruction is one of the Science and Technology priorities of the Secretary of Defense for Fiscal Years 2013-2017. Unfortunately, the remote detection of special nuclear materials is difficult because the materials are not very radioactive, the radiation signatures decrease rapidly with distance, and faint sources of radiation can be obscured by naturally occurring and man-made radioactive sources. The Radiation Detection Section of the High Energy Space Environment Branch of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory has developed the SuperMISTI stand-off detection system for maritime environments.

"land–sea contrast in lightning activity over the sea and peninsular regions of south/southeast asia","2012","The land–sea contrast in lightning activity between three sea regions of the Arabian sea (AS), the Bay of Bengal (BB) and the Chinese sea (CS) and two land regions of the Peninsular India (PI) and the Indo-China Peninsula (IP) has been studied from the 11‐year (1995 to 2005) data obtained from the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Lightning activities in different sea regions and over different peninsular regions are also compared with each other. The values of flash rate over peninsular regions (PI and IP) are 2.6 to 33 times of those over sea regions (AS, BB, CS). Although this contrast is seen throughout the year it is more dominant in the premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. Seasonal variations of the monthly-averaged values of the average flash rate are semiannual in all regions with one maximum in April/May and another in October. The two peaks in semiannual variations are attributed to the variation in surface air temperature. In addition, the October peak may have some contribution from the unstable thermodynamic conditions during the withdrawal phase of the summer monsoon. The annual flash rate shows an increasing trend of 1.1 to 1.2 times increase in both land and sea regions in South Asia but no significant change in the regions in Southeast Asia during the 1995–2005 period. The monthly-averaged flash rates are positively correlated with the average surface temperature and convective available potential energy (CAPE) and negatively correlated with the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), with higher correlation coefficients over peninsular regions than over the sea regions. The flashes over peninsular regions, though more frequent, are likely to be less energetic and have only 0.4 to 0.9 of the radiance that is found over the sea regions. The lowest flash rate in the AS region can be attributed to the dominance of more maritime conditions with shallower clouds in monsoon season in this region.","Land–sea contrast,Lightning in SA/SEA,Lightning,"
"waveform selection for a scanning radar in the maritime environment","2021","Detection of slow moving targets for a scanning radar in the maritime domain is typically performed using non-coherent detectors with both pulse-to-pulse and/or scan-to-scan integration.

"vessel detection in video with dynamic maritime background","2012","Automating the detection of non-cooperative vessels in surveillance video is challenging. First, the detection algorithm has to handle a large degree of appearance variation of vessels with respect to shape, size and viewing geometry. Second, a unique challenge in the maritime domain is the presence of sea clutter, which can cause a high number of false detections. While recent research in object detection has largely been focused on objects on the ground, we have developed a layered detection algorithm to address challenges in the maritime domain by fusing cues from (1) a discriminative detection algorithm that learns a vessel target model from hundreds of vessel images, and (2) a dynamic texture-based background model that adaptively learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of sea clutter. We present results on how each layer of the algorithms was individually optimized, and how their outputs were fused. Initial results were promising showing a significantly lower false alarm rate than when only the target model was applied. The proposed approach has applications in port, coastal and waterway surveillance.","geometry,discriminative detection algorithm,latent SVM,Support vector machines,Detection algorithms,port surveillance,spatiotemporal phenomena,Machine learning,false alarm rate,sea clutter,dynamic textures,vessel images,ships,degree of appearance variation,boats,Training data,object detection,noncooperative vessels,image texture,maritime domain,vessel detection,waterway surveillance,dynamic maritime background,Adaptation models,vessels,video signal processing,coastal surveillance,Clutter,Object detection,video surveillance,ATR,learning (artificial intelligence),spatiotemporal dynamics,Heuristic algorithms,dynamic texture-based background model,"
"chapter 10 - on the use of evolutionary algorithms for localization and mapping: infrastructure monitoring in smart cities via miniaturized autonomous sensory agents","2019","Miniaturized autonomous sensory agents (MASAs) can play a pivotal role in smart cities of tomorrow. From monitoring underground infrastructure such as pollution in water pipes, to exploration of natural resources such as oil and gas. These smart agents will not only detect anomalies, they are expected to provide sufficient data to facilitate mapping the detected anomalies, while—cleverly—adopting their behavior based on the changes presented in the environment. However, given these objectives and due to MASA’s miniaturization, conventional designing methods are not suitable to design MASA. On one hand, it is not possible to use the widely adopted simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) schemes, because of the hardware limitations on-board of MASA. Furthermore, the targeted environments for MASA in a smart city are typically GPS-denied, hardly accessible, and either completely or partially unknown. Furthermore, designing MASA’s hardware and their autonomous on-line behavior presents an additional challenge. In this chapter, we present a framework dubbed as evolutionary localization and mapping (EVOLAM), which uses multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to tackle the design and algorithmic challenges in using MASAs in monitoring infrastructure. This framework facilitates offline localization and mapping, while adaptively tuning offline hardware constraints and online behavior. In addition, we present different types of MOEAs that can be used within the framework. Finally, we project EVOLAM on a case-study, thus highlighting MOEA effectiveness in solving different complex localization and mapping problems.","Miniaturized autonomous sensory agents,Localization,Evolutionary computation,Mapping,Infrastructure monitoring,"
"the utility of body size indices derived from optical plankton counter data for the characterization of marine zooplankton assemblages","2012","To evaluate the utility of size-based indices derived from an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) through detection of spatial and temporal trends in zooplankton biomass, zooplankton size data were collected with an OPC across the Scotian Shelf region of the northwest Atlantic Ocean in April and October of 1997, 1998, and 1999. Eight size-based indices were computed – three simple size metrics (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, coefficient of variation) and metrics derived from the Normalized Biomass Size Spectrum (NBSS; X- and Y-coordinates and curvature of a fitted quadratic function) and the Pareto distribution (Y-intercept and slope). Results indicate that the simple size indices and those derived from the Pareto distribution consistently accounted for the greatest portion of annual variation in zooplankton biomass whereas indices derived from the NBSS accounted only for some secondary patterns. Simple indices also accounted for the greatest portion of spatial variance in zooplankton biomass whereas the NBSS and Pareto accounted for secondary patterns. Patterns in zooplankton communities based on these indices reflected broad taxonomic trends and were related to independent observations on atmospheric and hydrographic conditions in the study area. Size-based zooplankton data from continuous survey instruments can provide powerful adjuncts to both freshwater and marine aquatic monitoring.","Pareto distribution,Optical Plankton Counter,Zooplankton,Body-size index,Scotian Shelf,Size spectrum,"
"maritime anomaly detection and threat assessment","2010","Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present.

"climatology and ranking of hazardous precipitation events in the western mediterranean area","2021","The western Mediterranean region often suffers from the devastating effects of flooding, caused by enormous rain accumulations that sometimes resemble the values produced by tropical systems. Despite the climatic and social relevancy of this type of episodes, there are some fundamental questions that would still be difficult to answer today, for example: where within the region are more cases recorded? or, which were the most potentially dangerous episodes? In this study, we identify, and then gather and unify information from, all the daily events occurred from 1980 to 2015. Using the MESCAN high-resolution gridded rainfall dataset, events are detected and for each case, the date and affected regions are recorded. Subsequently, events are ranked according to their magnitude and classified by weather type. In addition, flood data from the FLOODHYMEX and EM-DAT databases are used to check whether the precipitation episodes resulted in flooding. All this information is collected into a publicly available single database. Results show that the highest number of events per year is recorded in the Languedoc-Roussillon region (France) and in the Valencian Community (Spain). The cases of greatest magnitude, which are associated with a larger number of floods, present a very marked seasonality, with about 80% of them occurring in September, October and November. Finally, we show that only four weather types are present in most of the days with hazardous rainfall in the western Mediterranean. The most hazardous situation is characterized by a low-pressure area at all tropospheric levels in the eastern Atlantic, forming a block pattern with an anticyclonic ridge that tends to extend from the Central Mediterranean to Central Europe. About 40% of the most extraordinary cases are associated with this configuration. As an example, the infamous Piedmont (Italy) 1994 episode, in the top 10 of the ranking, was produced by an atmospheric pattern of this type.","Weather types,Floods,Mediterranean,Hazardous rainfall,Events ranking,"
"dynamic selection scheme of lte-m and 5g for efficient maritime communication based on traffic volume","2023","This paper investigates the technology for selecting communication scheme based on the amount of traffic in LTE-M (Marine) and 5G communication environments. Recently, it has been possible to use LTE-M and 5G communications for preventing collisions between ships and obstacles in coastal areas, moving from a focus on terrestrial users. This paper proposes a scheme for efficiently handling both small-scale and large-volume traffic generated from terminals on ships. LTE-M can accommodate more terminals by utilizing the wide coverage of coastal areas, but it can be vulnerable to high-volume video processing for real-time obstacle detection. 5G provides a high data transmission rate and low latency, making it suitable for large data exchanges between ships or real-time services, but its short coverage makes it unsuitable for accommodating a wide area. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme for dynamically selecting LTE-M or 5G communication schemes according to the amount of data generated by terminals on ships, to transmit data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to decide which communication scheme, LTE-M or 5G, should be chosen based on the amount and type of traffic. The algorithm dynamically selects the optimal communication scheme considering real-time traffic information and network status. By implementing a simulation environment for coastal areas using the technique proposed in this paper, we compare the scheme where terminals installed on ships selectively use LTE-M and 5G communication schemes with the scheme where two communication schemes are chosen randomly for transmission. The simulation results confirm that the proposed technique can process more data compared to the existing schemes.","Streaming media,Sea measurements,5G Communication Technology,Multi-Sensor Based Systems,5G mobile communication,Base stations,Heuristic algorithms,Fire Detection and Evacuation,Telecommunication traffic,System performance,"

For instance, deriving mission planning tools with multiple stakeholders and achieving coverage with a wide choice of platforms (coastal, airborne and satellite) are just some of the problems. In addition, it could be required to correlate results with intelligence data and to integrate radar systems with the automatic identification system (AIS) and vessel traffic services (VTS). Other issues could be providing navigational risk detection to support operators, as well as improving resource allocation for greater efficiency and cost savings. Having access to other services, such as weather and environment information, could be precious for route planning.

"real-time multi-object tracking using adaptive filtering and filter banks for maritime applications","2021","This paper presents a novel approach to Multi-Object-Tracking (MOT), which solves the well-known problem of maritime surveillance. We use exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDAR, and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to measure the surroundingsâ€™ Vessels. These objects are associated using evidence theory. Afterward, the proposed algorithm tracks all the objects using a new concept: each object is tracked with a respective filter bank consisting of three Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters (AEKF) as subfilters. These have the same prediction model but different correction algorithms based on various measurement sources. The covariance noise matrices are adapted based on the current measurement quality. The filter banks can overcome drawbacks such as wrong and incomplete measurements, thus improving tracking performance.We have validated the algorithm in real-world scenarios in Rostock Harbor, Germany. The proposed algorithm can track all the objects within the view simultaneously in real-time. By comparing with a reference vessel, the mean 2D position error is ca. 2 m, which is much smaller than the AIS-only solution (5 to 10 m). During the test drive, the filter bank can detect and compensate for incorrect information, such as biased AIS positioning or incomplete LiDAR measurements, to guarantee robust positioning.","covariance matrices,Kalman filters,measurement sources,signal denoising,Prediction algorithms,channel bank filters,respective filter bank,Laser radar,time multiobject tracking,Adaptive Extended Kalman Filters,MultiObject-Tracking,Filter banks,object tracking,Evidence theory,Automatic Identification System,filtering theory,maritime surveillance,Weight measurement,nonlinear filters,maritime applications,Real-time systems,adaptive filtering,size 5.0 m to 10.0 m,wrong measurements,different correction algorithms,tracking performance,Current measurement,geophysical signal processing,current measurement quality,incomplete measurements,size 2.0 m,adaptive filters,oceanographic techniques,"

"design of a decision support system to achieve condition-based maintenance in ship machinery systems","2023","A decision support system is proposed for the condition-based maintenance of ship machinery systems based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach. A case study is conducted for a container ship's main diesel engine. Within the scope of the methodology, the main engine power is predicted based on exhaust gas outlet temperatures of cylinders and the main engine shaft RPM. In this regard, firstly, two different strategies such as the creation of the cylinder-basis model and the development of the overall system model are developed to determine the ANFIS model structure for the analysis. Then, comparative analyses are carried out to select a suitable ANFIS structure and its specific membership functions. In addition, the estimation process is also performed by the artificial neural network (ANN) model, and its results are compared with the findings of the best ANFIS structure. The success of the constructed models is evaluated by some error metrics. The overall ANFIS model with 5 membership functions is determined as the best approach by scores of 0.9806 for R2, 1.6588 MW for RMSE, and 3.2703 for MAPE. As a result of the estimation procedure, a decision support system to assist marine operators in maintenance operations is developed. The proposed strategy can be applied to different types of systems in the ship engine room such as the fuel oil system and can be improved by including more parameters obtained from the system's significant points in the analysis.","Anomaly detection,Ship machinery system,ANN,Condition-based maintenance,Maintenance,ANFIS,"

"mapping dark shipping zones using multi-temporal sar and ais data for maritime domain awareness","2022","The monitoring of ships which do not report their Au-tomatic Identification System (AIS) information is important for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). In this paper, an improved maritime picture is generated by presenting a new methodology to map these so-called â€˜darkâ€™ ships over time. Firstly, a robust and accurate data association between Syn-thetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detections and AIS data is carried out on multi-temporal SAR imagery and AIS data. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to unassigned SAR ship detections to reveal the spatial distri-bution of â€˜darkâ€™ zones (i.e. areas where repeated unassign-ments occur). This analysis helps identify areas where ships frequently do not report, which can help guide authorities in the best way to respond.

"review and analysis of methods for assessing maritime waterway risk based on non-accident critical events detected from ais data","2020","The safe navigation of ships is of high societal concern. A promising approach for analyzing waterway risks is using non-accident critical events as surrogate indicators of collision accidents. These are typically detected in data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Recognizing the significant interest in this approach, this article provides a review and analysis of methods based on the detection of non-accident critical events from AIS data, which aim to provide insight into maritime waterway risk. Considering also recent calls for increased focus on foundational issues in risk research and safety science, each method in the literature is critically reviewed based on five questions: How are non-accident critical events defined? What is the accident-theoretical basis of the method? How are non-accident critical events ranked? How is the method used? To what extent has the method been validated? Based on the results, it is concluded that focus is needed to build evidence of the validity of the models’ results, if these are to be effectively used for waterway risk analysis. As a prerequisite, more focus is needed on how exactly non-accident critical events are defined, and what factors are involved in the relation between their occurrence and accident involvement.","Non-accident critical event,Maritime safety,AIS data,Accident theory,Validation,"

"variability of lightning activity in south/southeast asia during 1997–98 and 2002–03 el nino/la nina events","2012","Impacts of the 1997–98 and 2002–03 ENSOs on total number of flashes and number of flash days from the LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) on board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and on the average flash rate from the combined OTD (Optical Transient Detector) / LIS data are studied in South/Southeast Asia (8° –30°N, 60°–120°E) for the period 1998–2005. Also examined is the difference between the geographical distributions of these parameters in the El Nino period in 1998 and in the corresponding normal period in 1999. During the 1997–98 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 12% and 36%, respectively, during the El Nino period and during the La Nina period decrease by 22% and 5%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding normal periods. Similarly, during the 2002–2003 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 28% and 5% during the El Nino period in 2002 as compared to the corresponding normal period. The contrast in lightning activity between the El Nino and La Nina periods is more pronounced in Southeast Asia than in South Asia because of the southeastward shift in the convection activity during the ENSO events. In both regions, however, monthly variations of both total number of flashes and average flash rate are almost parallel to that of surface temperature. Although, the inverse relationship between the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and El Nino broke down in 1997–98, the relationship between the El Nino and lightning maintains its normal increasing trend, indicating that the lightning activity is more sensitive to the convective activity than to rainfall on seasonal time scale. The total number of flashes and aerosol loading increase in the break‐period regime as compared to the monsoonal regime. The number of flash days in both ENSO events is higher in the EL Nino phase and lower in the La Nina phase as compared to their normal values in the subsequent years. Enhancement of lightning activity is mostly concentrated over land areas. Our results show that although diurnal variations in lightning activity can be related to the variations in surface temperature, convective adjustment induced by the corresponding ENSO phase needs to be considered for explaining the lightning activity variations on these longer time scales.","ENSO impact,South/Southeast Asia,El Nino impact,Lightning activity,"

"maritime environment perception based on deep learning","2022","Environment perception is an essential aspect of automated maritime vehicles, especially in high-traffic areas. In recent years, deep-learning-based object detection using LiDAR has been well developed in the automotive sector but has not yet seen a similar level of sophisticated development in maritime applications. In these applications, LiDAR detection should be fused with other maritime navigation systems such as the automatic identification system (AIS) to expand the detection range. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks. The remaining LiDAR data points are treated as static environments and represented by polygons. We evaluated the approach by using simulative and real-world datasets. In the simulation, the average precision of the CNN object detector reaches 60.8%, with a data processing rate of 40 Hz in GPU. Our real-world evaluations show that this approach can track 83% of the vessels in a crowded harbor, with the overall intersection over union reaching 64%. Our proposed approach represents the first application of CNN for LiDAR-based maritime environment perception, demonstrating its high potential for future online and real-world applications.","high-traffic areas,real-world applications,static environment mapping,Kalman filters,CNN object detector,automated maritime vehicles,deep-learning-based concept,static environments,Laser radar,neural nets,frequency 40.0 Hz,deep learning,object tracking,automatic identification system,LiDAR detection,Intelligent vessels,supervised learning,maritime navigation,AIS,object detection,sophisticated development,image classification,Radar tracking,Artificial intelligence,convolutional neural network,optical radar,Point cloud compression,Radar,maritime applications,maritime navigation systems,detection range,LiDAR-based maritime environment perception,multi-object tracking,Object detection,deep-learning-based object detection,multiobject tracking,learning (artificial intelligence),remaining LiDAR data points,Detectors,"

"heterogeneous twin dehazing network for visibility enhancement in maritime video surveillance","2021","Visible images captured by maritime video surveillance system under hazy environment often suffer from low contrast and information loss, etc. These negative factors will significantly limit the development and progression of target recognition, detection, tracking, and other vision-based technologies in maritime applications. However, existing dehazing methods are mainly designed for massive inland images, resulting in inaccurate estimation of haze-free versions under the maritime scene. In this work, we propose a heterogeneous twin dehazing network (termed HTDNet) for enhancing visually-degraded maritime images. The HTDNet is mainly composed of two modules, i.e., twin feature extraction module (T-FEM) and feature fusion module (FFM). In particular, T-FEM is employed to collect coarse haze features from two views, and FFM is designed for feature integration and enhancement. To further improve the visual quality, the dataset containing massive maritime images is constructed to train our network. Both synthetic and real-world experiments have illustrated our superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods. There is thus a great potential to successfully extend our HTDNet to enable maritime intelligent transportation system.","T-FEM,massive inland images,HTDNet,massive maritime images,Conferences,data visualisation,Feature extraction,maritime intelligent transportation system,image enhancement,maritime video surveillance system,feature extraction module,visibility enhancement,target tracking,Target recognition,image fusion,fusion module,FFM,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,twin feature extraction module,Video surveillance,video signal processing,feature integration,coarse haze features,Visualization,feature fusion module,video surveillance,vision-based technologies,visual quality,target recognition,Estimation,heterogeneous twin dehazing network,visible images captured,hazy environment,"
"influence of the geomagnetic field on the iact detection technique for possible sites of cta observatories","2013","We investigate the influence of the geomagnetic field (GF) on the Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope technique for two northern (Tenerife and San Pedro Martir) and three southern (Salta, Leoncito and Namibia (the H.E.S.S.-site)) site candidates for Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatories. We use the CORSIKA and sim_telarray programs for Monte Carlo simulations of gamma ray showers, hadronic background and the telescope response. We focus here on gamma ray measurements in the low energy, sub-100GeV, range. Therefore, we only consider the performance of arrays of several large telescopes. Neglecting the GF effect, we find (in agreement with previous studies) that such arrays have lower energy thresholds, and larger collection areas below 30GeV, when located at higher altitudes. We point out, however, that in the considered ranges of altitudes and magnetic field intensities, 1800–3600m a.s.l. and 0–40μT, respectively, the GF effect has a similar magnitude to this altitude effect. We provide the trigger-level performance parameters of the observatory affected by the GF effect, in particular the collection areas, detection rates and the energy thresholds for all five locations, which information may be useful in the selection of sites for CTA. We also find simple scaling of these parameters with the magnetic field strength, which can be used to assess the magnitude of the GF effect for other sites; in this work we use them to estimate the performance parameters for five sites: South Africa-Beaufort West, USA-Yavapai Ranch, Namibia-Calapanzi, Chile-La Silla and India-Hanle. We roughly investigate the impact of the geophysical conditions on gamma/hadron separation procedures involving image shape and direction cuts. We note that the change of altitude has an opposite effect at the trigger and analysis levels, i.e. gains in triggering efficiency at higher altitudes are partially balanced by losses in the separation efficiency. In turn, a stronger GF spoils both the shape and the direction discrimination of gamma rays, thus its effects at the trigger and analysis levels add up resulting in a significant reduction of the observatory performance. Overall, our results indicate that the local GF strength at a site can be equally important as its altitude for the low-energy performance of CTA.","Cherenkov light,Imaging Air Cherenkov technique,Monte Carlo simulations,CTA observatory project,Cherenkov detectors,Geomagnetic field,Extensive Air Shower,"

Lightning strokes measured by a lightning detection network, human thunderstorm observations at weather stations and convective cells derived from radar reflectivity are used. The analysis reveals conditions favourable for thunderstorm development and highlights regions affected under different flow regimes. Additionally, the cell-based analysis shows that different synoptic conditions are typically associated with specific cell characteristics, such as the direction and speed of movement or cell sizes and severity. These relationships can be explained meaningfully via a description of the synoptic-meteorological characteristics of each of the standard weather patterns. As such these results may support a better understanding of thunderstorm formation as well as improve forecasters' situational awareness.","Climatology,Thunderstorm,Automatic classification,Synoptic conditions,"

Within this work we exploit the over 20-year data record from NASA EOS satellites to investigate the degree to which space-borne observations can detect shifts in known eruption dynamics at Kīlauea. Through the combined analysis of remotely sensed plume heights, plume particle microphysical properties, lava flow thermal tracking and high resolution SO2 mapping, we provide interpretations of the satellite signals in a volcanic context and link them to ground-based eruption reports for validation. We establish common patterns of plume dispersion and particle evolution and identify when significant shifts in activity occur. We also determine where ambient conditions influence the output retrieved from the space-borne sensors. By comparing the inferences derived from remote-sensing with the extensive record of suborbital observations at Kīlauea, we assess the strengths and limitations of the satellite-based volcanic assessment techniques. The work presented here highlights the capabilities of these techniques, allowing us to more confidently interpret volcanic activity observed from space globally, particularly in cases where ground observations are limited or entirely lacking.","Eruption tracking,Volcano remote sensing,Kīlauea,NASA earth observing system,TROPOMI,MODIS,MISR,"

Atmospheric optical depth data retrieved by MODIS on board Aqua satellite and cloud to ground lightning activity data provided by ZEUS network operated by the National Observatory of Athens were analyzed for a time period spanning from 01/01/2005 up to 31/12/2013. The results indicate the importance of aerosols in lightning modulation. The mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) values of the days with lightning activity were found to be higher than the mean seasonal AOD in 90% of the under study domain. Furthermore, the increasing rate of lightning activity with increasing aerosol loading was found to be more pronounced during summertime and for AOD values up to 0.4. Additionally, the spatial analysis showed that the percentage of days with lightning activity during summertime is increasing with increasing AOD. Finally, time series showed similar temporal behavior between AOD seasonal anomalies and days with lightning activity differences. Both the spatial and temporal analysis showed that lightning activity is correlated to AOD, a characteristic consistent for all seasons.","Mediterranean Sea,ZEUS lightning detection network,Lightning,Aerosol atmospheric optical depth,MODIS,"
"concurrent use of satellite imaging and passive acoustics for maritime domain awareness","2010","The research being conducted in the Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR), a DHS National Center of Excellence for Port Security examines some basic science issues and emerging technologies to improve the security of ports and inland waterways, as well as coastal and offshore operations. This research follows a layered approach utilizing above water and underwater surveillance techniques. The investigated layers include satellite-based wide area surveillance; HF Radar systems providing over-the-horizon monitoring; and nearshore and harbor passive acoustic surveillance. Integration of these systems is aimed at achieving vessel detection, classification, identification, and tracking. In this paper, we present the results of sea tests where satellite imagery was combined with concurrent passive acoustic surveillance. The wide area sensing was provided by the University of Miami CSTARS facility's electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. Satellites detected the ships using a panchromatic EO sensor FormoSat-2 and SAR from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The Stevens Passive Acoustic System was used for detecting sound produced by the same ships that were detected by satellites. Concurrent Satellite - Acoustic measurements provide the following advantages: 1. Increasing the probability of small vessel detection and decreasing false alarms. 2. The joint systems can provide redundant detection and classification in conditions where one of the systems fails. For example, EO satellite imaging does not work at night and in fog and cloudy conditions while acoustic detection has limits during stormy weather due to ambient noise. SAR imaging can detect vessels in all weather, but provides less detail about a specific vessel. 3. Acoustics can provide target classification and bearing and satellites can give target localization and heading. SAR data can be used to estimate vessel speed in some cases. 4. Satellite imaging is helpful for the acoustic detection of an underwater target in cases when satellite information allows separation of surface and underwater targets. 5. Joint measurements provide more data (information) for target classification. Several tests were conducted in New York Harbor, where the satellite images and acoustic signatures of the same boats were recorded. The satellite registered a number of small boats. The small boats were acoustically detected at distances up to 4 km and the signal generated by a passenger ferry was observed at a distance up to 7 km.","Satellites,military radar,Stevens passive acoustic system,CSTARS facility's electro-optical radar,maritime domain awareness,acoustic signature,maritime security,underwater vehicles,DHS National Center of Excellence,acoustic detection,satellite tracking,Acoustic sensing,target tracking,Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce,Miami University,HF radar systems,synthetic aperture radar,satellite imaging,panchromatic EO sensor,underwater surveillance,port security,radar imaging,vessel detection,optical radar,underwater acoustic communication,New York Harbor,Acoustics,offshore operations,Boats,Sonar equipment,coastal operations,satellite sensing,passive acoustics,acoustic surveillance,Surveillance,FormoSat-2,COSMO-SkyMed constellation,Security,target classification,"

"detection of aeromagnetic anomaly change associated with volcanic activity: an application of the generalized mis-tie control method","2009","Repeat aeromagnetic surveys may assist in mapping and monitoring long-term changes associated with volcanic activity. However, when dealing with repeat aeromagnetic survey data, the problem of how to extract the real change of magnetic anomalies from a limited set of observations arises, i.e. the problem of spatial aliasing. Recent development of the generalized mis-tie control method for aeromagnetic surveys flown at variable elevations enables us to statistically extract the errors from ambiguous noise sources. This technique can be applied to overcome the spatial alias effect when detecting magnetic anomaly changes between aeromagnetic surveys flown at different times. We successfully apply this technique to Asama Volcano, one of the active volcanoes in Japan, which erupted in 2004. Following the volcanic activity in 2005, we conducted a helicopter-borne aeromagnetic survey, which we compare here to the result from a previous survey flown in 1992. To discuss small changes in magnetic anomalies induced by volcanic activity, it is essential to estimate the accuracy of the reference and the repeat aeromagnetic measurements and the probable errors induced by data processing. In our case, the positioning inaccuracy of the 1992 reference survey was the most serious factor affecting the estimation of the magnetic anomaly change because GPS was still in an early stage at that time. However, our analysis revealed that the magnetic anomaly change over the Asama Volcano area from 1992 to 2005 exceeded the estimated error at three locations, one of which is interpreted as a loss of magnetization induced by volcanic activity. In this study, we suffered from the problem of positioning inaccuracy in the 1992 survey data, and it was important to evaluate its effect when deriving the magnetic anomaly change.","Magnetic anomaly change,V olcanic activity,Aeromagnetic anomalies,Asama Volcano,Mis-tie control method,"
"a fault detector/classifier for closed-ring power generators using machine learning","2021","Condition-based monitoring of power-generation systems is naturally becoming a standard approach in industry due to its inherent capability of fast fault detection, thus improving system efficiency and reducing operational costs. Most such systems employ expertise-reliant rule-based methods. This work proposes a different framework, in which machine-learning algorithms are used for detecting and classifying several fault types in a power-generation system of dynamically positioned vessels. First, principal component analysis is used to extract relevant information from labeled data. A random-forest algorithm then learns hidden patterns from faulty behavior in order to infer fault detection from unlabeled data. Results on fault detection and classification for the proposed approach show significant improvement on accuracy and speed when compared to results from rule-based methods over a comprehensive database.","Random forests,Condition-based monitoring,Classification,Principal components,Machine learning,Detection,"
"energy-efficient task offloading of edge-aided maritime uav systems","2023","This paper considers the autonomous detecting and tracking task of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the maritime environment. Due to the high computational complexity of the image-processing task, the strict latency requirement of the tracking task, and the shortage of batteries and computational capability of UAVs, the UAVs can offload the computing-intensive task to the edge computing server (ECS) to reduce the task latency and energy consumption. Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption. In addition, we optimize the transmission power, the local CPU frequency, the offloading rate of UAVs, and the bandwidth allocation between UAVs. We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof. By combining the convex optimization with the genetic algorithm, an offloading algorithm with low complexity and good performance is obtained, which is verified by comparing with some benchmark offloading strategies in the numerical results.","unmanned aerial vehicles,Image edge detection,energy-efficient task offloading,remotely operated vehicles,image resolution,Energy consumption,convex programming,control engineering computing,bandwidth allocation,transmission power optimization,genetic algorithms,detection accuracy,edge computing server,genetic algorithm,Energy resolution,strict latency requirement,Target tracking,optimisation,edge computing,local CPU frequency,tracking task,UAV computational capability,visual tracking,high-definition image-processing task,mathematical proof,offload,visual target tracking,power aware computing,computing task size,edge-aided maritime UAV systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,Edge computing,maritime environment,energy consumption,Image resolution,computational complexity,energy consumption optimization problem,Task analysis,computing-intensive task,ECS,UAV,"

Limited resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this paper, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information from observable behavior (geospatial aspects, kinematic features and contextual information) and maritime domain knowledge from diverse sources.

"a hybrid entropy-based dos attacks detection system for software defined networks (sdn): a proposed trust mechanism","2021","Software defined networks are an emerging category of networks in which the data plane and control plane are separated. This separation of planes opens the door for designing sophisticated routing algorithms that would overwhelm the computing power of traditional networking nodes. In this paper, we consider the possibility of introducing node trust into the routing problem. There are many ways for measuring node trust. However, in this paper, we focus on denial of service attacks. We develop a hybrid method for detecting denial of service attacks and incorporate this information in routing decisions so that nodes that are part of a botnet can be quickly identified and excluded from the network. The proposed method is flexible enough to allow nodes that have been suspected of participating in a denial of service attack to be “rehabilitated” if they cease their malicious behavior. The technique is also able to detect the start of a second attack while another one is on-going. Our results indicate that the proposed method for detecting denial of service attacks performs better than non-hybrid techniques.","Entropy,Denial of service attacks,Stochastic distance metrics,Software defined networks,"
"a deep encoder-decoder network for anomaly detection in driving trajectory behavior under spatio-temporal context","2022","Traditional trajectory anomaly detection aims to find abnormal trajectory points or sequences using data mining techniques. As a comparison, we focus on the evaluation of the anomalies of driving habits for different drivers based on their trajectory data. This is particularly important for the application of adjusting the amount of insurance in accordance with the driving behaviors. Instead of customizing rules for modeling various driving behaviors, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for driving trajectory anomaly detection, called STDTB-AD. Specifically, taking into account the fact that movement is spatial–temporal dependent, the study first partitions the whole road network into a series of spatial–temporal units, which have homogeneous properties of traffic flows. Then, the motion parameters (i.e., acceleration, speed, and direction) of driving trajectories falling within each spatio-temporal unit are calculated for representing context-aware features of drivers. This method is able to detect the deviation of movement from the normal traffic state on the spatial–temporal units. Finally, a variational autoencoder is utilized to quantify the abnormity degree of each driver according to the reconstruction probability of driving feature vector. Evaluations based on taxi trajectory data show that our model can consider both the spatial and temporal contexts for detecting driving behavior anomalies and achieve higher detection accuracy than traditional models based on either spatial or temporal context.","Anomaly detection,Driving behavior,Deep learning,Trajectory data,"
"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings.

"moving ship optimal association for maritime surveillance: fusing ais and sentinel-2 data","2022","Nowadays, a variety of different sources can be combined together to measure and monitor maritime human activities. Reliable data fusion techniques are essential to associate the targets from different systems for maritime surveillance. In particular, the fusion of data from Sentinel-2 satellites and the automatic identification system (AIS) has attracted wide attention due to their public availability and complementarity. However, most traditional methods for target association are not suitable for this particular case, due to the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, we first construct two new datasets for the detection of moving ships and their wakes based on Sentinel-2 images. Combined with the detection results obtained by the you only look once (YOLOv5) model, the position and course information of the detected ships are first extracted. After carefully analyzing the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data, we develop a new domain adaptation-based method for target association based on the fusion of Sentinel-2 and AIS data, called moving ship optimal association (MSOA). Different from standard domain adaptation methods only for representation alignment, the proposed MSOA is able to align representation, time, and position simultaneously. A case study is provided in which the newly proposed method is tested over the Port of Long Beach, USA. Experimental results demonstrate that both moving ships and wakes are well detected. Specifically, our newly proposed MSOA exhibits more accurate and robust performance when compared to traditional methods, and the detected ships without corresponding AIS tracks can also be detected by our MSOA. Moreover, the real sensing time and time lag of Sentinel-2 data are deduced with high accuracy. Overall, it can be concluded that our MSOA provides a new perspective for accurate target association based on heterogeneous data fusion.","surveillance,Remote sensing,sensor fusion,remote sensing,MSOA,time lag,ship detection,detected ships,heterogeneous data fusion,Marine vehicles,domain adaptation,ship optimal association,Data fusion,accurate target association,geophysical image processing,Sentinel-2 images,target tracking,Optical sensors,ships,time lag phenomenon,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,target association,you only look once (YOLO),Artificial intelligence,radar tracking,moving ships,Sentinel-2 satellites,Sensors,Surveillance,maritime surveillance (MS),domain adaptation-based method,reliable data fusion techniques,AIS data,Sentinel-2 data,"

"maritime target detection based on radar graph data and graph convolutional network","2022","Due to the complex sea clutter environment and target features, the conventional statistical theory-based methods cannot achieve high performance in maritime target detection tasks. Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN.

"a probabilistic risk approach for the collision detection of multi-ships under spatiotemporal movement uncertainty","2021","It is vital to analyse ship collision risk for preventing collisions and improving safety at sea. The state-of-the-art of ship collision risk analysis focuses on encountering conflict between ship pairs, subject to a strong assumption of the ships having no/little spatiotemporal motion uncertainty. This paper proposes a probabilistic conflict detection approach to estimate potential collision risk of various multi-vessel encounters, in which the spatiotemporal-dependent patterns of ship motions are newly taken into account through quantifying the trajectory uncertainty distributions using AIS data. The estimation accuracy and efficiency are assured by employing a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, which provides the quantitative bounds on the approximation accuracy and allows for a fast estimation of conflict criticality. Several real experiments are conducted using the AIS-based trajectory data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed new approach. The results show that it enables the effective detection of collision risk timely and reliably in a complicated dynamic situation. They therefore provide valuable insights on ship collision risk prediction as well as the formulation of risk mitigation measures.","Multi-ship spatiotemporal movements,Ship collision risk,Probabilistic conflict detection,Maritime safety,AIS data,Uncertainty time-dependent analysis,"

"the significance of spectral position in the rhodopsins of tropical marine fishes","1973","Visual pigments were extracted from the retinae of a large and diverse sample (179 species, in 40 families) of tropical marinefishes. By the method of partial bleaching, most of these were found to be retinal-1 pigments, with their maxima tightly grouped between 489 and 502 nm; but a few have λmax at shorter wavelengths. The spectral position of these pigments does not correlate with diurnal or nocturnal activity patterns, nor do closely related species necessarily have similar pigments. In general, the deeper-living species have rhodopsins with λmax at shorter wavelengths, a correlation with the bluer quality of light in deeper water. The spectral distribution of light was measured in air and underwater at a coral atoll. During twilight the underwater spectrum narrows and shifts to shorter wavelengths, as a result of increased absorption of yellow-orange light by the atmosphere. This effect at twilight is unique among the general spectral events that constitute each day. The behavioral patterns of reef fishes make clear the relationships between underwater light and the visual pigments. During evening twilight, there is an orderly sequence, in which the diurnal fishes seek cover, and then, after a “Quiet Period”, the nocturnal species emerge. The “Quiet Period” is the most critical and visually difficult time because light intensities are transitional between the thresholds of photopic and scotopic vision. Predation reaches a maximum during the “Quiet Period”. The rhodopsins of all these fishes tend to match the background light available during evening and morning twilight. Photochemically, visual sensitivity is maximized and, as a result, predation is held in check. The relationships between light, behavior and visual physiology are discussed. Although their rhodopsins are spectrally similar to those of the prey, crepuscular predators obtain a visual advantage by having moderate numbers of very large cones, which provide adequate sensitivity and sufficient resolution for motion detection.

"maritime target tracking from an airborne multi-channel radar","2022","Detection and tracking of small maritime targets using high-resolution airborne radar is a difficult problem due to the non-stationary and non-Gaussian nature of sea clutter.

The detection scheme uses space time adaptive processing (STAP) with a relatively high false alarm rate. While this improves the overall probability of detection, there are also a multitude of false (spurious) detections. As the radar scans, the target is illuminated over a range of azimuth angles, resulting in a large number of detections per target. A solution based on clustering the STAP output is proposed to create equivalent point target measurements, with the clustering output subsequently processed by a standard point-detection Bernoulli tracking filter.

"effect of smart meter data collection frequency in an early detection of shorter-duration voltage anomalies in smart grids","2019","Smart grids are required to respond quickly and efficiently to any types of electrical incidents. This is possible only if advanced monitoring and decision support tools are available for the operators to collect and analyze the real-time data from the entire power system. Sensors and smart meters become necessary for an effective smart grid operation, as they can play a significant role in measuring system parameters such as the temperature of the transmission line, power outages and power usage. These sensors allow communication between the generation side and user side to ensure full network observability. Hence, the volume of data which needs to be analyzed for more reliable electrical services has been increased. Upon the analysis of all the data collected, useful insights can be gained to bring benefits to the utilities, consumers and the related organizations. In this project, the effect of smart meter data collection frequencies on the early detection of short-duration voltage anomalies has been investigated. An anomaly detection algorithm that analyzes the voltages collected from smart meters is developed. The proposed anomaly detector checks the normality of the voltage data collected from the smart meters installed at the residential loads. To test the effectiveness of the frequent-and-large smart meter data, a smart grid model was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the model was tested under three different operating conditions. The efficacy of the anomaly detector with the smart meter data collected at different data collection intervals was compared under the three operating conditions. The investigation of the smart meter data clearly shows that the shorter-duration anomalies can be detected effectively with more frequent data and hence it reveals the potential of smart meters in the early detection of short-duration anomalies in smart grids.","Smart devices,Anomaly detection system,Photovoltaic system,Large data,Smart grid,"

Indeed, being able to detect any drift or change in behavior compared to a reference behavior represents a major challenge in the monitoring of complex machines like a HTGU. In this paper, an early anomaly detection model for HTGU using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL) is proposed.

The technique provides the ability to specify different thresholds for each of the Doppler bins. The analysis is extended to include Swerling type 1 and 2 targets for the calculation of PD.

"automatic fault detection in seismic data using gaussian process regression","2019","Compartmentalization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, change in fluid contacts, effects of high permeable fractures around faults, and hydrocarbon traps created by seal faults make fault detection and extraction as a necessity in the analysis of seismic data. Faulting disrupts the smoothness trend of geological layers (reflections in seismic sections) and displaces layers along its plane. Thus, a fault could be considered as an abnormal phenomenon that globally deviates normal behavior of layers around its plane. In the present study, faults are considered as sparse global anomalies in a seismic section that can be extracted using Gaussian process regression. The Gaussian process regression is a nonparametric probabilistic model based on Bayesian statistics that can be used to model spatial properties as a regression problem. The Gaussian process usually is used to extract and describe normal interactions from the data set using smooth functions. The main idea of this study is to detect the global anomaly using Gaussian process regression. For this purpose, we considered geological layers as smooth normal events in seismic sections. Therefore, the location of the fault plane is where the Gaussian process gets an error during describing the layers. Abnormalities such as faults cause the Gaussian process to suffer an error near the anomaly. We used these errors and analyzed them to detect probable locations of fault edge. Finally, we used a consistent connection algorithm to separate most probable fault points and to connect them to an edge using morphological reconstruction algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Several synthetic seismic sections with different levels of signal to noise ratios were used to evaluate the algorithm in the presence of random noise. The results showed that all points predicted by a diagnostic test fell into the area above the diagonal of the receiver operating characteristics space, which represents a good diagnostic classification.","Global anomaly detection,Gaussian process regression,Fault,Reconstruction morphology,"
"spatio-temporal data mining for maritime situational awareness","2015","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is the capability of understanding events, circumstances and activities within and impacting the maritime environment. Nowadays, the vessel positioning sensors provide a vast amount of data that could enhance the maritime knowledge if analysed and modelled. Vessel positioning data is dynamic and continuous on time and space, requiring spatio-temporal data mining techniques to derive knowledge. In this paper, several spatio-temporal data mining techniques are proposed to enhance the MSA, tackling existing challenges such as automatic maritime route extraction and synthetic representation, mapping vessels activities, anomaly detection or position and track prediction. The aim is to provide a more complete and interactive Maritime Situational Picture (MSP) and, hence, to provide more capabilities to operational authorities and policy-makers to support the decision-making process. The proposed approaches are evaluated on diverse areas of interest from the Dover Strait to the Icelandic coast.","synthetic representation,Trajectory,data mining,Synthetic aperture radar,maritime situational awareness,Safety,Ports (Computers),mapping vessels activities,maritime situational picture,Data mining,automatic maritime route extraction,spatio-temporal data mining,Security,Knowledge discovery,oceanographic techniques,"
"assessment of the impact of fouling on vessel energy efficiency by analyzing ship automation data","2020","Shipbuilding and shipping areas are technically dependent to each other since shipping is the end user in the shipbuilding industry. One of the biggest maritime challenges arose due to regulations about emissions and has begun to be a worldwide concern. The maritime industry has enormous potential in terms of a reduction in energy use and emission supervision, especially with respect to existing ships. The specific challenges to shipping are energy inefficiency and emissions; vessel electrification, where sailing displacements and infrastructures permit; and vessel performance optimization. One of these challenges is addressed in this work: operational improvement in detection of the impact of fouling or opposite hull cleaning which enables greater efficiency and an increase in performance. In this paper, battery hybrid electric ship automation data are analysed using Curve Fitting and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) in order to interpret the impact of fouling on ship energy performance degradation by continuous monitoring. Although this methodology is already used for analysing various time series data, DFA is a novel approach that is first time that applied to a marine based data where fouling contains marine biological properties. Application of these techniques reveal that in only 9 months fouling, performance degradation of case study ferry faced 6% of average speed loss.","Ship energy efficiency,curve fitting,detrended fluctuation analysis,fouling,"

"passive microwave remote and in situ measurements of artic and subarctic snow covers in alaska","1991","Between 11 and 19 March 1988, airborne and satellite passive microwave measurements were acquired simultaneously with ground measurements of depth, density and stratigraphy of the snow in central and northern Alaska. Five aircraft flights were flown along a north-south transect between about 147 ° W and 152 ° W, and extending from about 63° N (south of Fairbanks, Alaska) to the Arctic Ocean coastline, with an Aircraft Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) on-board operating at 92 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, and 18 GHz. Passive microwave data from the satellite-borne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), operating at 85.5 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, 18 GHz, and 10 GHz, were obtained concurrently. A good correspondence in brightness temperature (TB) trends between the aircraft and satellite data was found. However, an expected inverse correlation between depth hoar thickness and TB was not found to be strong. A persistent TB minimum in both the aircraft and the satellite data was detected along the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. In an area located at about 68° 50'N, 149° 20'W, the TB as recorded from the aircraft microwave sensor dropped by 55 K. Satellite microwave measurements showed a TB decrease of up to 45 K at approximately the same location. Snow pit measurements did not reveal notable differences in snow characteristics or depth in this location. An examination of passive microwave satellite data from 1978 to 1987 revealed that similar low latewinter TB values were found in approximately the same locations as those observed in March 1988. According to the satellite data, the zone of low TB develops as the snow deepens, and reaches the lowest values in March or April each year. The cause of this TB minimum is unknown but thought to be related to snow stratigraphy. The observed difficulty in relating the ground measurements to data collected using aircraft and satellite passive microwave sensors is attributed to the fact that the snow depth and character are highly variable in central and northern Alaska. This variability is exemplified in the field measurements as well as in the passive microwave measurements.",""
"long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using landsat images and deep learning","2023","Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.","Landsat,WST,Surface thermal plume,Deep learning,Thermal infrared remote sensing,Nuclear power plants,"

"improbability mapping: a metric for satellite-detection of submarine volcanic eruptions","2014","Submarine volcanic eruptions can result in both real and apparent changes in marine algal communities, e.g., increases in phytoplankton biomass and/or growth rates that can cover thousands of square kilometers. Satellite ocean color monitoring detects these changes as increases in chlorophyll and particulate backscattering. Detailed, high resolution analysis is needed to separate the optical effects of volcanic products from the response of the marine algal community. It is possible to calculate an index, which maps the magnitude of improbable change (relative to long term average conditions) following known volcanic eruptions by using low resolution, initial estimates of chlorophyll and backscatter along with an archived history of satellite data. We apply multivariate probability analysis to changes in global satellite ocean chlorophyll and particulate backscatter data to create a new metric for observing apparent biological responses to submarine eruptions. Several examples are shown, illustrating the sensitivity of our improbability mapping index to known submarine volcanic events, yielding a potentially robust method for the detection of new events in remote locations.","Improbability mapping index,Satellite detection,Submarine volcanic eruptions,"
"maritime moving target long time integration for gnss-based passive bistatic radar","2018","This paper addresses the exploitation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive bistatic radar systems for maritime surveillance. The main limitation of this technology is the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites, which makes it necessary to define innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration. To this aim, this paper puts forward long integration time techniques able to collect the signal energy over long time intervals (tens of seconds), allowing the retrieval of suitable levels of signal-to-disturbance ratios for detection purposes. A local plane based technique is first considered, providing target detection in a plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. As a suboptimum solution in terms of achievable integration gain, but more efficient from a computational point of view, a second technique is considered working in the conventional bistatic range and Doppler plane (basic plane based).

"detecting co2 leakage at offshore storage sites using the covariance between the partial pressure of co2 and the saturation of dissolved oxygen in seawater","2018","An option to detect CO2 leakage from deep geological storage under the seabed is monitoring the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the sea. One of the challenges of this technique is to differentiate pCO2 elevations caused by CO2 leakage from variations in the natural baseline (which varies due to seasonal and other factors). This paper compares a covariance threshold for anomalous pCO2 (a threshold based on pCO2 and dissolved oxygen), with annual and seasonal constant thresholds, using data observed in two hydrologically contrasting areas in Osaka Bay, Japan. In one of these locations the water column is typically stratified throughout the year, whereas at the other it is vertically mixed. The covariance threshold often but not consistently outperforms the constant thresholds, but is effective in all the cases analyzed in the present study. In any season in the mixed area, and in winter in the stratified area, the possibility of false-negatives in the seasonal threshold method is smaller than or comparable with that in the covariance threshold one. In areas with large natural pCO2 variations, such as during summer in the stratified area, the covariance threshold method is efficient in detecting CO2 leakage whereas the seasonal threshold method is of little use. With a good understanding of local conditions, monitoring pCO2 with the covariance threshold method is a potentially useful but not sufficient option for leakage detection in the marine environment.","Dissolved oxygen,CO leakage,Coastal ocean,Monitoring,Detection,Partial pressure of CO,"
"evidence for solar influence in a holocene speleothem record (père noël cave, se belgium)","2018","We present a decadal-centennial scale Holocene climate record based on trace elements contents from a 65 cm stalagmite from Belgian Père Noël cave. “Père Noël” (PN) stalagmite covers the last 12.7 ka according to U/Th dating. High spatial resolution measurements of trace elements (Sr, Ba and Mg) were done by Laser-Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Trace elements profiles were interpreted as environmental and climate changes in the Han-sur-Lesse region. Power spectrum estimators and continuous wavelet transform were applied on trace elements time series to detect any statistically significant periodicities in the PN stalagmite. Spectral analyses reveal decadal to millennial periodicities (i.e., 68–75, 133–136, 198–209, 291–358, 404–602, 912–1029 and 2365–2670 yr) in the speleothem record. Results were compared to reconstructed sunspot number data to determine whether solar signal is presents in PN speleothem. The occurrence of significant solar periodicities (i.e., cycles of Gleissberg, de Vries, unnamed 500 years, Eddy and Hallstatt) supports for an impact of solar forcing on PN speleothem trace element contents. Moreover, several intervals of significant rapid winter change were detected during the Holocene at 10.3, 9.3–9.5, around 8.2, 6.4–6.2, 4.7–4.5, and around 2.7 ka BP. Those intervals are similar to the cold winter events evidenced in different natural paleoclimate archives, suggesting common climate forcing mechanisms related to changes in solar irradiance.","Wavelet analysis,Solar forcing,Paleoclimate time-series,NAO,Speleothems,Cold winter events,Holocene,Trace elements,"

"detecting outlier pairs in complex network based on link structure and semantic relationship","2017","In this paper, we propose an outlier pair detection method, called LSOutPair, which discovers the vast differences between link structure and semantic relationship.

(2) how can we measure the semantic similarity using the short texts? (3) how can we find the objects’ maximum differences between link structure and semantic relationship? To tackle these challenges, LSOutPair applies three main techniques: (1) two matrices are used to store link similarity and semantic similarity, (2) a k-step index algorithm, which calculates the term weighting for each object, (3) applying the linear transformation of Frobenius norm to matrices can obtain the top-K outlier pairs.

"maritime automated targets recognition algorithm test bed for high resolution isar imagery","2013","A maritime automatic target recognition system is under development to perform ship classification using images from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) systems. This work will describe the algorithm framework for feature extraction, classification, and aim-point recognition. ISAR systems produce two-dimensional images of ships from the periodic motion inherent to all maritime objects and can be used to distinguish objects of interest for Homeland Security. There is a need for real-time classification of these objects. This work extends the state of the art in two ways: One - current maritime classification focuses on satellite ISAR, creating latency for classification[1]; and Two - work with Homeland Security ISAR radar systems is focused on concealed weapon detection [2,3]. This work uses localized ISAR images from stationary radars to classify maritime objects. Since the aspect and cross-range scale factor are continually changing, ISAR images form distinct representations unique to each object under observation. These distinct representations are analogous to visual images in many ways. They have unique shapes and areas of strong return, much in the same way objects in passive images have unique sizes and colors. However, ISAR images are synthetic portrayals of scattered field data from active sensor RF sensors whereas visual images are observations of passive sensors. This distinction must be a considered as a design constraint in the classification system - each feature employed must be exhaustively examined regarding its physical counterpart. Within that constraint, ISAR synthetic imagery feature extraction techniques can leverage from previous work developed for passive sensors. This is especially the case of High Range Resolution (HRR) ISAR systems. After extraction from ISAR prototype images, a set of representative features will be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a supervised learning model capable of pattern recognition.","marine radar,active sensor,Inverse synthetic aperture radar,image motion analysis,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,image colour analysis,supervised learning model,Target recognition,periodic motion,ships,radar computing,marine engineering,support vector machines,2D ship images,object detection,automated target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,image classification,maritime automated target recognition algorithm test bed,high range resolution ISAR imagery,RF sensors,Classification algorithms,SVM,homeland security ISAR radar systems,radar imaging,support vector machine classifier,Doppler effect,high resolution,Image segmentation,concealed weapon detection,weapons,satellite ISAR system,aim-point recognition,inverse synthetic aperture radar systems,stationary radars,Image resolution,national security,maritime object classification,image sensors,ship classification,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern recognition,passive sensors,object recognition,oceanographic techniques,"
"ship radial size estimation in high-resolution maritime surveillance radars via sparse recovery using linear programming","2019","For high-resolution maritime surveillance radars operating at scan mode and transmitting long duration pulses, radial size estimation of ships is severely interfered by range sidelobe effect of pulse compression. Due to range sidelobe effect, strong ship returns often cover a range interval wider than its radial size and the range interval covered by detected ship returns is sometimes a severe overestimate of its radial size. An approach to mitigate severe overestimation of ship radial sizes is to find the borders of high-resolution range profile (HRRP) of a ship. Therefore, ship radial size estimation boils down to the recovery of sparse HRRPs of ships from radar returns with heavy-tailed sea clutter in a coherent processing interval (CPI) only containing several pulses. In this paper, a sparse recovery method using linear programming (LP) is proposed to recover sparse HRRPs of ships from radar returns with heavy-tailed sea clutter. As a minor contribution, a full scheme is presented for ship radial size estimation in high-resolution surveillance radars operating at scan mode, which consists of coherent detection along with range cells, annotation of the range interval covered by ship returns, the decision of severe range sidelobe effect, recovery of sparse HRRPs of ships, and radial size computation. The performance of the proposed LP-based method to estimate ship radial size is evaluated by using simulated and real radar data. The experimental results show that it attains more accurate radial size estimates of ships than existing methods.","maritime surveillance radars,marine radar,ship radial size estimation,radar detection,radar clutter,Marine vehicles,range sidelobe effect,pulse compression,CPI,radial size estimation,ships,radial size computation,object detection,High-resolution maritime surveillance radars,sparse recovery method,search radar,ship returns,sparse HRRP,Radar clutter,high-resolution range profile,high-resolution range profile (HRRP),coherent processing interval,linear programming,Radar imaging,Clutter,radar resolution,sidelobe effect,Surveillance,high-resolution surveillance radars,sparse recovery,Estimation,heavy-tailed sea clutter,"
"airborne maritime surveillance using magnetic anomaly detection signature","2020","For an airborne sensor, there is a pressing need to be able to detect/track submerged submarines, shipwrecks, sea mines, unexploded explosive ordnance, and buried drums during maritime surveillance. Traditional usage is the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD), where the small changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by the ferrous components of the targets are measured. The primary means of long-range detection and classification of targets are with passive and active acoustic sensors, and MAD is used for accurate final localization. MAD could also be used for land-based targets but this is not common. Knowing the relationship between the magnetic signature and the kinematic parameters, the tracking problem can be formulated under a Bayesian framework. In this article, multiple nonlinear filters are used for a real single surface-target tracking problem in maritime surveillance using an airborne total-field sensor. The posterior CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound for MAD is derived.

"unsupervised maritime traffic graph learning with mean-reverting stochastic processes","2018","Inspired by the fair regularity of the motion of ships, we present a method to derive a representation of the commercial maritime traffic in the form of a graph, whose nodes represent way-point areas, or regions of likely direction changes, and whose edges represent navigational legs with constant cruise velocity. The proposed method is based on the representation of a ship's velocity with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and on the detection of changes of its long-run mean to identify navigational way-points. In order to assess the graph representativeness of the traffic, two performance metrics are introduced, leading to distinct graph construction criteria. Finally, the proposed method is validated against real-world Automatic Identification System data collected in a large area.","real-world data,Clustering algorithms,Anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,graph construction criteria,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic processes,unsupervised maritime traffic graph learning,Stochastic processes,maritime situational awareness,DBSCAN,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,change detection,ships,automatic identification system,stochastic processes,motion control,AIS,navigational legs,maritime traffic graph,Artificial intelligence,velocity control,graph theory,constant cruise velocity,Legged locomotion,clustering,graph representativeness,Navigation,navigation,graph learning,navigational way-points,ship velocity,"
"runoff variation characteristics, association with large-scale circulation and dominant causes in the heihe river basin, northwest china","2019","The water resources in arid and semi-arid regions are critical to providing reliable sources of water for food production and ecosystem functioning. In this study, continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence were used to analyse the runoff periodicity and relationship with climate indices, respectively. Additionally, the double mass curve (DMCD), the slope changing ratio of cumulative quantity (SCRCQ) and the Choudhury–Yang equation (Budyko-CY) methods for different potential evapotranspiration data (E0(E0-20 cm, E0-PM, E0-H)) were used to separate the impacts of climate changes and anthropogenic activities on runoff variations. The results demonstrated that the flow regimes in high and low flow seasons were not obvious shifts, and that after implementation of the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP), ecosystems were gradually restored in the downstream portion of the Heihe River Basin (DHRB). Periodicities of 1–7 years and 1–5.8 years were detected in Yingluoxia and Zhengyixia, respectively. Additionally, on a 1–148.2 month timescale, the monthly runoff with AO, NAO, PDO, and AMO had significant resonance periodicity and a 1–48 month Spearman's lag correlation. On the annual and high-flow, climate changes dominant determinant to an increase of runoff for the DMCD and Budyko-CY in period 2, SCRCQ and Budyko-CY in period 3 for different E0 in the upstream (UHRB). In the midstream (MHRB) region, anthropogenic activities played a dominant role in deducing the runoff by the SCRCQ and Budyko-CY methods for different E0 values in period 3. During the low-flow season, the impact of human activities in the UHRB and climate changes in the MHRB was significant for period 2 and 3. Therefore, the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes caused by the introduction of different E0 on different timescales should be fully considered in the future.","Runoff variation,Separation methods,Heihe River Basin,Dominant causes,Potential evapotranspiration,"
"a comparison of terrasar-x, radarsat-2 and alos-palsar interferometry for monitoring permafrost environments, case study from herschel island, canada","2011","Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data sets from TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-PALSAR are compared for their ability to detect ground movement over the continuous permafrost site of Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, Canada. All three sensors maintain good coherence within a summer season and can be used to create summer displacement products. Stacking is advantageous for the TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data sets, although mottling, possibly an interaction of the SAR with vegetation, or residual tropospheric noise, is visible, reducing the reliability of the results. RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-PALSAR provide the most promising results with the ability to form one year interval interferograms. PALSAR can also form two and three year interval interferograms. Long interval data sets spanning 2007 to 2010 identify a band of movement of 20 to 30cm/year along the north-east coast, and a region of movement of up to 5cm/year near the northern tip of the island. The ability to form long interval displacement products holds the most promise for permafrost monitoring, since long-term trends are of greater interest for permafrost stability than short-term seasonal changes. TerraSAR-X data have the disadvantage that year to year interferograms cannot be formed. InSAR is not the ideal monitoring technique for the large thaw slumps of Herschel Island. Although general areas of instability can be identified, specific slump detection is limited by radar look direction, and the large and abrupt slump movement, often accompanied by disintegration and collapse of slump sections, causes loss of coherence in the InSAR data. Thaw slumps may require a different interferometric approach, such as slump extent mapping from coherence loss, or the installation of corner reflectors and point target techniques. The frequent revisit and high spatial resolution of TerraSAR-X provide the best chance of maintaining coherence over thaw slumps. In general, InSAR is more successful at identifying broad areas of subtle subsidence in gentle relief, areas of terrain instability, possibly due to permafrost thaw or ground ice melt and the removal of water volume, and prior to significant slumping.","SAR,Herschel Island,Interferometry,Terrain stability,Permafrost,Arctic,"
"risk models for maritime security, area and port force protection","2010","Asymmetric and terrorist threats stand as perhaps one of the greatest threats to maritime forces at present. Accordingly, there has been an increase in the study of problems related to this threat in the defense community. This report discusses models related to maritime security, area and port force protection. The primary focus is the discussion of an area force protection model designed to consider the situation where an escorted vessel traveling through constrained waters comes under attack by a fast, small boat. A method where discrete bursts of gunfire are averaged over time to provide an effectiveness model is presented and used to identify the likelihood of defending against such an attacker. The approach is also used to identify the effects of ship maneuvers and augmentation teams in improving the probability of a positive outcome. Three other models that examine port scenarios are presented. The first is based on the same methodologies as the area force protection model and gives a measure of the ability to neutralize an incoming threat by a shore-based or moored defender. For the others, one uses an agent-based approach to identify how the positioning of a patrol boat guarding a particular asset affects its response capabilities, while the other introduces a ship-turning model to help define the areas in a port that could be struck by a hijacked commercial vessel. For all models, an example of the type of output that can be produced is presented.","Monte Carlo methods,patrol boat guarding positioning,shore-baseddefender,augmentation teams,agent-based approach,ship-turning model,maritime security,defence industry,marine safety,area force protection model,moored defender,hijacked commercial vessel,Force,port force protection,ship maneuver effect identification,sea ports,risk models,Boats,Weapons,Security,Radiation detectors,"
"influence of aerosol particles from biomass burning on cloud microphysical properties and radiative forcing","2006","Aerosol from biomass burning has been shown to strongly modify cloud microphysical properties and cloud lifetime through the so-called “indirect effect.” However, in the case of a lack of wet scavenging, it stays suspended for days to weeks and can be transported to considerable distances within an elevated layer above low-level cloud tops with minimal aerosol–cloud interactions. The observations carried out during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI) 2000 dry season field campaign often revealed the presence of an elevated biomass-burning aerosol layer above a semi-permanent stratiform cloud deck off the southern African coasts. MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products were used to investigate the existence of an aerosol indirect effect on convective clouds. Results are presented documenting cloud effective radius and cloud radiative forcing variations due to the presence of the aerosol during the development of convective clouds. Radiative transfer simulations in the visible (0.8μm, VIS) and near-infrared (1.6, 2.1 and 3.7μm, NIR) wavelengths were instrumental in establishing the extent of the influence of a biomass-burning aerosol layer overlying a water cloud sheet on the MODIS satellite retrieval of cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius and the optical thickness. The radiative transfer simulations suggest that the presence of the aerosol induces a significant underestimation of the cloud optical thickness, whereas an underestimation of the retrieved effective radius is more pronounced in the retrieval that makes use of the 1.6μm waveband than the 2.1 and 3.7μm wavebands. The MODIS cloud products of 3 days of the SAFARI 2000 campaign were analyzed to determine whether the aerosol induced biases evidenced by the simulations also affect the operational cloud property retrieval. Cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius, are usually employed as indicators of the occurrence of aerosol–cloud interaction according to the “indirect effect.” However, these results highlight some of the difficulties associated with satellite retrievals of cloud properties and show the importance of an accurate sighting of the cloud and aerosol layer top and bottom heights in order to prevent erroneous detections of indirect effects.","Aerosol–cloud interactions,Remote sensing,Cloud parameter retrieval,Radiative transfer,"

"integrated x band active phased array radar for maritime surveillance","2021","Airborne maritime surveillance plays an important role in safeguarding the coastline and exclusive economic zones. A multi-functional Maritime Patrol Radar (MPR), which can provide 360 degree azimuth coverage and operate in various modes like sea surface surveillance, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inverse SAR (ISAR), Search-and-Rescue, Weather etc., is crucial for providing an effective maritime situational awareness. The performance of such systems are usually limited by sea clutter and aperture constraints imposed by the aircraft. Unlike the older generation mechanical radar, MPR based on Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) can overcome these limitations with its capability in instantaneous beam steering, spacetime agility etc. This paper performs an extensive simulation study on sea-clutter, derives the optimal system parameters and defines a prototype Integrated X-band Active Phased Array Radar (IXAPAR). Each building block of IXAPAR has been designed using state-of-the-art technology.

While there are currently many approaches to obstacle detection in maritime environments (e.g., LiDAR, radar) the proposed approach resorts to standard, inexpensive RGB cameras to perform the detection of such obstacles. Recent advances in deep neural network detectors achieve state-of-the-art detection results, and some one-stage networks achieve very good results while maintaining inference times small enough to be compatible with real-time capabilities on low-cost embedded processing units.In this paper, we train the YOLO v4 network to detect different types of ships, using publicly available maritime datasets.

"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"

To tackle this problem, we make use of the multichannel coherent single data set algorithm which removes the need for any training data, thus alleviating the problem of clutter heterogeneity.

"integration of in-situ and multi-sensor satellite observations for long-term water quality monitoring in coastal areas","2020","Recently, there have been significant efforts in the integration of in-situ and satellite observations for effective monitoring of coastal areas (e.g., the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency). In this study, a 15-year diurnal variation of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) was retrieved from multi-sensor satellite images and in-situ hyperspectral measurements using Radiative Transfer (RT) modeling in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The existing RT model 2SeaColor was inverted against time series of in-situ hyperspectral measurements of water leaving reflectances (Rrs [sr−1]) for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs (i.e., Chlorophyll-a (Chla), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM)) on a daily basis between 2003 and 2018 at the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS) located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. At the same time, the existing coupled atmosphere-hydro-optical RT model MOD2SEA was used for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs from time series of multi-sensor satellite images of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard ENVISAT, Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 between 2003 and 2018 over the Dutch Wadden Sea.

"gps based system for detection and control of maritime boundary intruding boats","2016","Maritime boundary violation and intrusion by fishing boats has been a huge concern not only for the errant fishermen and their families but also a massive burden on governments and public alike, due to the complexity of the issue and the naivety of the people involved. The chief solution is to safe guard these fishermen from the danger which they are encountering in everyday life for their livelihood. Hence, keeping the above problems in mind, this paper proposes a GPS based boat detection and tracking system which would safe guard the fishermen from the potential dangers they might face by giving them pre-warning in case of trespassing. In particular, we are proposing to control the navigation so that the fishermen are directed to safe region. This system was designed and demonstrated already.

"maritime surveillance using multiple high-frequency surface-wave radars","2014","In the last decades, great interest has been directed toward low-power high-frequency (HF) surface-wave radars as long-range early warning tools in maritime-situational-awareness applications. These sensors, developed for ocean remote sensing, provide an additional source of information for ship detection and tracking, by virtue of their over-the-horizon coverage capability and continuous-time mode of operation. Unfortunately, they exhibit many shortcomings that need to be taken into account, such as poor range and azimuth resolution, high nonlinearity, and significant presence of clutter. In this paper, radar detection, multitarget tracking, and data fusion (DF) techniques are applied to experimental data collected during an HF-radar experiment, which took place between May and December 2009 on the Ligurian coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The system performance is defined in terms of time on target (ToT), false alarm rate (FAR), track fragmentation, and accuracy. A full statistical characterization is provided using one month of data. The effectiveness of the tracking and DF procedures is shown in comparison to the radar detection algorithm. In particular, the detector's FAR is reduced by one order of magnitude.

"discovering themes and trends in transportation research using topic modeling","2017","Transportation research is a key area in both science and engineering. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of 17,163 articles published in 22 leading transportation journals from 1990 to 2015. We apply a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on article abstracts to infer 50 key topics. We show that those characterized topics are both representative and meaningful, mostly corresponding to established sub-fields in transportation research. These identified fields reveal a research landscape for transportation. Based on the results of LDA, we quantify the similarity of journals and countries/regions in terms of their aggregated topic distributions. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we find some general research trends, such as topics on sustainability, travel behavior and non-motorized mobility are becoming increasingly popular over time. We also carry out this temporal analysis for each journal, observing a high degree of consistency for most journals. However, some interesting anomaly, such as special issues on particular topics, are detected from temporal variation as well. By quantifying the temporal trends at the country/region level, we find that countries/regions display clearly distinguishable patterns, suggesting that research communities in different regions tend to focus on different sub-fields. Our results could benefit different parties in the academic community—including researchers, journal editors and funding agencies—in terms of identifying promising research topics/projects, seeking for candidate journals for a submission, and realigning focus for journal development.","Research policy,Topic modeling,Transportation research,Publication data,"

"maritime target detection using frequency estimation","2020","Coherent detection schemes have been shown to offer performance benefits over non-coherent techniques in the maritime radar context. To further improve performance, the use of sparse representations with judiciously selected dictionaries has been proposed as a method to separate target returns from surrounding sea clutter. This paper exploits a robust frequency estimation scheme to effectively separate the target from clutter and noise. The approach offers two advantages: (1) it does not require a dictionary to be designed to support the scheme and (2) the scheme is capable of estimating multiple frequencies, thus suitable for targets with multiple Doppler components. In this work, we use both real and simulated sea clutter with synthetic targets for evaluation. It is found that the proposed technique can improve performance over traditional coherent detection for both point targets and more complex targets with multiple frequency components.","complex targets,marine radar,maritime target detection,noncoherent techniques,multiple Doppler components,radar detection,target detection,radar clutter,maritime radar context,sea clutter,multiple frequency components,target tracking,point targets,sparse representations,Doppler effect,synthetic targets,Frequency estimation,Radar,Radar cross-sections,radar signal processing,simulated sea clutter,Doppler radar,coherent detection schemes,Clutter,frequency estimation,Computational modeling,Radar detection,robust frequency estimation scheme,"

"growth response of scots pines in polar-alpine tree-line to a warming climate","2017","Coniferous trees at the alpine and polar tree lines of the Northern Hemisphere represent the outermost limit of their ecological range. Under such conditions, even small temperature variations may cause growth responses, which therefore can be used as indicators for changing environmental conditions. In this study we analysed the radial growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) along a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient at six locations in the polar and alpine tree-line ecotone in Finnish Lapland. We evaluated the effect of climatic trends on pine growth in relation to tree age and region, specifying a northern and a southern region in the study area. We found a response of Scots pine to climatic variations until the 1980s, but not to the current warming period. Increasing growth trends could be detected since 2000 in the radial growth of southern located trees, predominantly of juvenile ages, while the northern trees did not respond significantly to the current warming. In the north recent warmer and wetter conditions during winter time, inducing snow loads, wind damages, diseases and frost damages possibly masked the benefits of warmer conditions. The missing link between warming and radial growth would affect the use of tree-rings as proxy for past climate and for predictions for forest extension in polar-alpine tree-line sites.","Environmental change,Tree age,Tree line,Growth response,Latitudinal and altitudinal gradient,Dendroecology,"
"primers for pcr-based detection of ostreid herpes virus-1 (oshv-1): application in a survey of new zealand molluscs","2007","The bivalves, Perna canaliculus, Spisula aequilatera, Pecten novaezelandiae, Austrovenus stutchburyi, Crassostrea gigas, Ostrea chilensis, Dosinia anus, Mactra discors, Paphies subtriangulata and the gastropod Haliotis iris were surveyed by histology and subsequent PCR for ostreid herpes virus (OsHV-1) infections. Histology was used to screen for indicative nuclear features such as Cowdry type A bodies, pycnosis and chromatin margination. Although no Cowdry bodies were seen in any samples, individuals from all species except M. discors, P. subtriangulata and D. anus exhibited some of the other features (albeit sparsely and atypically) and 75 samples out of 885 examined were deemed worthy of further investigation. DNA was purified successfully from 68 of these 75 samples. DNA was also extracted from fresh oyster tissue for the host oyster positive control. All PCR primers used were designed to amplify small (<300 bp) DNA fragments as would be expected from formalin-fixed tissue. The efficacy of these primer pairs with histology samples was confirmed by detectable PCR amplification of oyster and viral DNA from a known OsHV-1 infected fixed and paraffin embedded histology sample of C. gigas. 68 of the 75 survey samples produced visible PCR amplification with the new Cg18SFor/Cg18SRev primer pair demonstrating successful host DNA extraction. This primer pair targets the C. gigas 18S ribosomal gene (product: 292 bp) and detectable PCR confirms both the successful extraction of DNA fragments large enough for amplification by the other primers and also the absence of PCR inhibitors. As little as 1 ng of C. gigas genomic DNA template generated a visible PCR product. Sequencing and alignment of the amplification product confirmed it as part of the C. gigas 18S rRNA gene. OsHV-1 DNA was sought by PCR in the 68 Cg18SFor/Cg18SRev PCR positives using two primer pairs: the extant C9/C10 (product: 196 bp), and the new pair OsHVDPFor/OsHVDPRev (product: 197 bp). As little as 1 pg and 10 pg (∼5000 and 50,000 OsHV-1 genome copies per PCR reaction) allowed these primer pairs, respectively, to detectably amplify a specific product. Sequencing and alignment with the OsHV-1 genomic sequence confirmed the amplification products as being the anticipated portions of the genome for these primer pairs. The PCR assays failed to detect OsHV-1 in any extracts except for the known positives and it is concluded that OsHV-1 is absent in this survey of New Zealand molluscs. Alternative explanations for the cytological features seen during the histology survey leading to provisional positives for OsHV-1 infection are discussed.","PCR,Ostreid herpesvirus,"

The main objective is to identify such fluctuations and capture them in terms of a concept drift, i.e., unforeseen shifts in statistical properties of the modeled target occurring over time. The empirical study is based on a collection of AIS vessel tracking data, spanning over a year. The scope of the study limits the AIS data area to the Baltic region (9-31°E, 53-66°N), which experiences some of the most dense maritime traffic in the world. The investigations employ a novel maritime traffic modeling method based on the potential fields concept, adapted for this study to facilitate the examination of concept drift. The concept drift is made apparent in course of the statistical and visual analysis of the experimental results. This study shows a number of particular cases, in which the maritime traffic is affected by concept drifts of varying extent and character. The visual representations of the traffic models make shifts in the traffic patterns apparent and comprehensible to human eye. Based on the experimental outcomes, the robustness of the modeling method against concept drift in traffic is discussed and improvements are proposed. The outcomes provide insights into regularly reoccurring drifts and irregularities within the traffic data itself that may serve to further optimize the modeling method, and – in turn – the performance of detection based on it.","maritime traffic,concept drift,traffic modeling,anomaly detection,"
"object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pixelwise rigidity criterion and application to maritime target recognition","2014","This paper describes a novel approach for rigid object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pre-recorded video with a moving camera, and we apply it to the problem of vessel segmentation in a maritime video scene. The difficulty of modeling background appearance or/and dynamic, modeling object appearance, and compensating camera motion renders this task very challenging. Therefore, the proposed method only uses a geometric constraint regarding target motion rigidity in order to achieve object segmentation in a full video segment. Such an idea is not new in object segmentation literature, but the novelty in this paper resides in that the target rigidity assumption is implemented at the pixel level, but not at the object scale. This is firstly achieved by deriving a theoretical optic flow model in the neighborhood of each pixel under the 3D rigid motion assumption of object, which is later compared against the observed 2D optic flow model in the neighborhood of a pixel in order to derive a pixelwise rigidity criterion. The latter is further reenforced along individual (pixel) trajectories in a video segment. Finally, a mere thresholding operation allows to quickly extract target from background in a full video segment. Our experiments using real maritime video sequences captured with an airborne camera have shown that the method detects maritime targets accurately.","Optical imaging,rigid object segmentation,maritime target detection,dynamic background,motion compensation,Cameras,background appearance modeling,Solid modeling,object segmentation,2D optic flow model,maritime video sequences,pixel trajectories,vessel segmentation problem,prerecorded video,Integrated optics,marine engineering,Three-dimensional displays,object appearance modeling,maritime target recognition,object detection,geometric constraint,rigid object,Object segmentation,video signal processing,moving camera,maritime video scene,nonrigid dynamic background,Motion segmentation,optic flow,image sequences,pixelwise rigidity criterion,image sensors,computational geometry,image segmentation,airborne camera,object recognition,camera motion compensation,"

"data-driven methods for detection of abnormal ship behavior: progress and trends","2023","Maritime traffic safety influences the development of world economies. A major aspect to enhance maritime traffic safety is the effective detection of abnormal ship behavior (DASB) which recently have been widely made based on data-driven methods using multisource heterogeneous data. In order to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of research, this study presents a review of DASB. First, the categories of abnormal ship behavior and data sources of DASB are concretely introduced, and the process of data-driven DASB combined with expert knowledge are described. Second, we conduct systematic disciplinary knowledge maps in the field of DASB, which identify evolution, hotspots and emerging trends. In this manner, data-driven methods for DASB were categorized into six types, including multisource data fusion approaches, statistical analysis approaches, traditional intelligent algorithmic approaches, deep learning approaches, knowledge-based and data-driven integrating approaches and computing power, and provide an overview of them. Then, we propose an integrated framework for DASB. Finally, we discuss the challenges in terms of three technical aspects (data, algorithm, and computing power) and outline possible paths of investigation for DASB to improve intelligent maritime surveillance.","Anomaly detection,Maritime traffic,Data-driven,Ship behavior,"
"simultaneous determination of four organotins in food packaging by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry","2015","A simple method based on high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of organotins—tri-n-butyltin chloride (TBT), triphenyltin chloride (TPT), dibutyltin dichloride (DBT), and diphenyltin dichloride (DPT)—in plastic food packaging. Samples were prepared by ultrasonic extraction with dichloromethane, followed by dissolution in acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, and purification by an MCX column. The extracts were analyzed by LC–MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring and positive modes with a C18 column; elution was carried out with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid. The limits of detection for TBT, TPT, DBT, and DPT were 0.1, 0.6, 0.8, and 0.3μgkg−1, respectively. The recovery of organotins in spiked samples ranged from 68% to 113% (relative standard deviation: 0.4–4.2%). The proposed method was successfully employed to identify the target analytes in plastic packaging used for milk and cake.","Simultaneous determination,LC–MS/MS,Food packaging,Organotin compounds,"
"security analysis of drones systems: attacks, limitations, and recommendations","2020","Recently, the world witnessed a significant increase in the number of used drones, with a global and continuous rise in the demand for their multi-purpose applications. The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people’s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird’s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.","Drones security,Terrorism/counter-Terrorism,Drones security countermeasures techniques,Drones threats and vulnerabilities,Drones forensics,Drone/UAV warfare,UAS,Drones attacks,UAV,UUV,Armed drones,"
"detection of ais messages falsifications and spoofing by checking messages compliance with tdma protocol","2023","Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information. It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Spoofing detection,TDMA protocol,Falsifications detection,Kalman filtering,"
"detecting small infrared maritime targets overwhelmed in heavy waves by weighted multidirectional gradient measure","2022","Efficient small infrared (IR) maritime target detection in heavy waves is a key and challenging task in maritime distress target search and rescue systems. The current methods are struggling to enhance targets and suppress heavy waves because of the similar local contrast. In this letter, a weighted multidirectional gradient (WMDG) measure is presented. First, the candidate targets are extracted via facet model. Then multidirectional gradient and difference information are constructed to calculate average cumulative multidirectional gradient (ACMG) and achieve directional difference measure (DDM). Consequently, the final saliency is reconstructed via ACMG weighted by DDM. Finally, the actual targets are segmented through an adaptive threshold.

"comparison of sparse signal separation algorithms for maritime radar target detection","2018","Due to the non-stationary nature of sea clutter, traditional maritime radar detection schemes utilise non-coherent processing. To further enhance the detection performance, one alternative is to use sparse signal separation. This is an alternative paradigm, whereby the different spatio-temporal characteristics of the radar signal are exploited to separate targets from the background interference. In previous work, the sparse signal separation problem has been posed in a compressive sensing framework so as to improve detection of small maritime targets. This paper investigates the performance of three different algorithms for solving the signal separation problem. These include the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm (SALSA), adaptive Complex Approximate Message Passing (CAMP) and the Fast Sparse Functional Iteration Algorithm (FSFIA). The first contribution is to reformulate the CAMP algorithm to the framework of sparse signal separation. The suitability of each algorithm is then assessed using real data from the Ingara radar, and is based on the quality of the solutions obtained, the computational speed and the robustness to the user's choice of `tuning' parameters.","detection,marine radar,CAMP algorithm,signal denoising,radar detection,radar clutter,Ingara radar,sparse signal separation problem,alternative paradigm,noncoherent processing,target tracking,spatio-temporal characteristics,separate targets,object detection,compressed sensing,Sea clutter,Sparse signal separation algorithms,radar signal,message passing,detection performance,nonstationary nature,radar signal processing,iterative methods,radar tracking,source separation,Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm,maritime radar target detection,Fast Sparse Functional Iteration Algorithm,sparse signal processing,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"enhancing automatic maritime surveillance systems with visual information","2017","Automatic surveillance systems for the maritime domain are becoming more and more important due to a constant increase of naval traffic and to the simultaneous reduction of crews on decks. However, available technology still provides only a limited support to this kind of applications. In this paper, a modular system for intelligent maritime surveillance, capable of fusing information from heterogeneous sources, is described. The system is designed to enhance the functions of the existing vessel traffic services systems and to be deployable in populated areas, where radar-based systems cannot be used due to the high electromagnetic radiation emissions.

With the trajectory cluster, the study proposes the use of trajectory segmentation algorithms to extract representative points of each trajectory and then use the k-means algorithm to obtain a series of centroids over all the representative points. These centroids, combined, form a new representative trajectory of the cluster. This new representative trajectory of the input cluster represents new contextual information extracted from the original set of trajectories, being possible to apply anomaly detection approaches over the new obtained context.

"hydrogeological characteristics influencing the occurrence of pesticides and pesticide metabolites in groundwater across the republic of ireland","2017","Pesticide contamination of water is a potential environmental issue which may impact the quality of drinking water. The full extent of pesticide contamination is not fully understood due to complex fate pathways in the subsurface. Groundwater pesticide occurrence was investigated at seven agricultural sites in different hydrogeological settings to identify where pesticide occurrence dominated in temperate maritime climatic conditions. In Ireland, six cereal dominated sites in the South East and one grassland site in the West were investigated. Soil and subsoils varied from acid brown earths with high permeability to clay and silt rich tills with lower permeability. Over a 2year monitoring period, 730 samples were collected from a network of dedicated wells and springs across the seven sites. Multi-nested piezometers were installed in intergranular, fissured and karstic type aquifers to target shallow, transition and deeper groundwaters. Several springs were also sampled and the network included a confined aquifer. Groundwater was analysed for nine pesticide active ingredients and eight metabolites. Mecoprop and 2,4-D were the most frequently detected active ingredients above the instrument detection limit, accounting for 36% and 26% of the 730 samples collected and analysed. Phenoxyacetic acid was the most frequently detected and widespread metabolite found in 39% of samples collected at all seven sites. Where the European Union drinking water standard of 0.1μg/L was exceeded, metabolites accounted for the majority of exceedances with 3,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (DBA) and phenoxyacetic acid (PAC) dominating. Highest detections were encountered in sites with well drained soils underlain by gravel and limestone aquifers and within gravel lenses in lower permeability subsoil. Across the seven sites pesticide detections were mostly associated with metabolites and the environmental impact of many of these is unknown as they have received little attention in groundwater previously.","Transformation product,Intergranular aquifer,Herbicide,Active ingredient,"
"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally.

"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"

"towards low-visibility enhancement in maritime video surveillance: an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network","2021","Limited by insufficient illumination, the images collected by maritime imaging devices often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, severe information loss, and so on.

It is capable of enhancing the fused information leading to preserving the edges, textures, and other fine details. To prevent the overexposure of enhanced images, we fuse and reconstruct the output features of DBs and ABs with the raw low-light image to get the final enhanced image through two residual blocks (RBs). The mixing of multiple network modules can effectively improve the generalization ability and robustness of our network.

"ais-based maritime anomaly traffic detection: a review","2023","Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade.

AIS provides one of the fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels’ traffic behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data. These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions. Several concerns and difficulties are involved in the analyses of vessel kinematics data: how to deal with big data generated, inconsistencies, irregular updates, dynamic data, unlabeled data, and evaluation.

In this scenario, graphical representation techniques play a key role in helping to reveal seasonal structures of human made noises. Nevertheless, for very long temporal series, it might be challenging to find a graphic visualization technique that allows representing a time range that is long enough to capture these seasonal events, while at the same time preserving short isolated events. We propose a framework for the creation of such visualization techniques and analyze the different stages involved: data reduction, color encoding, and signal processing on graphs.

"results from 3 seasons of surveys in maritime canada using the leica chiroptera ii shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor","2017","The coastal zone is a challenging place to map, techniques for mapping the land cover and elevation do not work under water and methods for mapping the seabed cover and elevation work well in deep water but are dangerous and expensive in shallow water. As a result, detailed information in the shallow coastal zone is lacking. This presentation will focus on the Chiroptera II, a new shallow water topo-bathymetric lidar sensor that is designed to collect seamless elevation data from land to the submerged terrain under coastal or freshwater. The sensor is equipped with a 1064 nm laser capable of a laser scanning frequency up to 500 kHz and a 515 nm green laser capable of a scanning frequency of 35 kHz. The lasers pulses are directed to the surface using a palmer scanner that results in an elliptical scan pattern with a 14 degree forward and back scan angle and a 20 degree left and right scan angle. The NIR laser is used to map details on the land and to assist in defining the water surface, which is critical in order to compensate for the 515 nm laser beam diffraction angle and the change of speed from air to water, thus accurately positioning the reflected seabed return. In addition to collecting the elevation at high resolution ~ 1m and vertical precision ~ 15 cm, the intensity of the reflected green laser also provides insights into what is on the seabed. A 60 MPIX RCD30 camera capable of capturing NIR and RGB bands of imagery is co-aligned with the lidar sensor to provide additional data that can be directly georeferenced with a ca 5 cm resolution. Full waveforms of the green laser are recorded and used to calculate discrete points representing the water surface, objects in the water column and the seabed bathymetry. Standard point attributes include the x, y, z positioning, echo information and intensity or amplitude of the reflected signal. An empirical method has been developed to compensate for the exponential energy loss of the green laser energy with water depth. This method results in a â€œdepth normalizedâ€ seabed intensity image which provides details on the seabed cover materials. Tools have been built to calculate waveform metrics of the seabed return including: total area under the curve, skewness, kurtosis, the left and right distance and angle to the peak. These waveform metrics can then be used to construct grids representing the metrics which can be used for subsequent bottom cover classification. NSCC-AGRG has conducted topo-bathy lidar surveys throughout Maritime Canada for the past 3 years using this sensor. Since the sensor relies on the penetration of 515 nm light to detect the seabed, water clarity and the reflectivity of the seabed are constraints on the depth of penetration of the lidar. Coastal waters have variable turbidity, often dominated by wind induced wave action that suspends near shore sediments causing poor survey conditions. A turbidity management system has been designed that relies on meteorological forecasts and observed wind conditions as well as shoreline orientation along the coast to predict suitable periods for bathymetric lidar surveys.

"coincident high resolution optical-sar image analysis for surface albedo estimation of first-year sea ice during summer melt","2007","The parameterization of sea ice albedo during summer, when fluctuations in the fractional coverage of melt ponds change on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, represents a significant challenge for both the modelling and remote sensing communities. Ubiquitous cloud cover in summer inhibits the use of optical sensors for providing large-scale estimates of sea ice surface albedo. C-band (5.3 GHz) Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data from ENVISAT-ASAR is compared to coincident surface climatological albedo (α) estimates derived from high-resolution Quickbird VIS-NIR imagery in order to demonstrate the utility of high-resolution, dual-polarized (VV, HH) SAR for detecting variations in α of melt pond covered landfast first-year sea ice (FYI) adjacent to Hudson Bay. Variations in ice α are detected from SAR imagery using the co-polarization ratio (γ), shown to be significantly correlated (−0.81) with α when melt ponds are in liquid form. Results show the use of γ represents a substantial increase in correlation to α when compared to conventional like-polarized SAR backscattering coefficients. A regression model demonstrates that γ can be used as an estimator for landfast-FYI α to within ±5.2% provided: (1) The SAR images at a shallow enough incidence angle to induce separation between like-polarized channels; and (2) the conditions of Bragg surface scattering, characteristic of relatively shallow FYI melt ponds, is met.","Melt ponds,Microwave scattering,Sea ice,Synthethic aperture radar,Albedo,"
"joint registration and fusion of an infrared camera and scanning radar in a maritime context","2020","The number of nodes in sensor networks is continually increasing, and maintaining accurate track estimates inside their common surveillance region is a critical necessity. Modern sensor platforms are likely to carry a range of different sensor modalities, all providing data at differing rates, and with varying degrees of uncertainty. These factors complicate the fusion problem as multiple observation models are required, along with a dynamic prediction model. However, the problem is exacerbated when sensors are not registered correctly with respect to each other, i.e., if they are subject to a static or dynamic bias. In this case, measurements from different sensors may correspond to the same target, but do not correlate with each other when in the same Frame of Reference (FoR), which decreases track accuracy. This paper presents a method to jointly estimate the state of multiple targets in a surveillance region, and to correctly register a radar and an Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system onto the same FoR to perform sensor fusion. Previous work using this type of parent-offspring process has been successful when calibrating a pair of cameras, but has never been attempted on a heterogeneous sensor network, or in a maritime environment. This article presents results on both simulated scenarios and a segment of real data that show a significant increase in track quality in comparison to using incorrectly calibrated sensors or single-radar only.","incorrectly calibrated sensors,surveillance,track accuracy,maritime,sensor fusion,marine radar,Infrared camera,infrared search and track system,multiple target state estimation,registration,target tracking,image fusion,multiple observation models,maritime context,wireless sensor networks,fusion problem,radar,Target tracking,PHD filter,Particle measurements,sensor modalities,Radar tracking,radar imaging,Atmospheric measurements,dynamic prediction model,image registration,Calibration,infrared detectors,common surveillance region,calibration,scanning radar,joint registration,infrared,Estimation,sensor networks,tracking,track quality,modern sensor platforms,"
"a continuous record of vegetation, fire-regime and climatic changes in northwestern patagonia spanning the last 25,000 years","2018","We present a high-resolution precisely dated terrestrial paleovegetation/paleoclimate record from Lago Pichilaguna, northwestern Patagonia (40°–44°S), which spans continuously from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. We find abundant and continuous presence of arboreal pollen (chiefly Nothofagus) during the LGM, accompanied by other trees, shrubs, and alpine herbs. These results suggest Subantarctic parkland and/or scattered woodlands under a cold and hyperhumid climate during the LGM (∼25,000–17,800 cal. yr BP) with expansion of Nothofagus under relatively warm interstadial conditions between 25,000 and 19,200 cal. yr BP. This was followed by cooling and a precipitation increase between 19,200 and 17,800 cal. yr BP, which was contemporaneous with the youngest LGM advance of Andean glaciers in the region and maximum influence of the Southern Westerly Wind (SWW). The Last Glacial Termination (T1) started at 17,800 cal. yr BP and featured the spread of thermophilous trees and ferns characteristic of North Patagonian rainforests, along with lake level lowering. These results suggest a warm pulse and southward shift of the SWW, concurrent with a rapid collapse of Andean glacier lobes. Subsequent changes led to the establishment of closed-canopy rainforests under peak interstadial warmth between ∼16,000 and 15,000 cal. yr BP. We detect a shift to cold/wet conditions during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,800–12,700 cal. yr BP) and a precipitation decline during Younger Dryas time, followed by maximum temperature, relatively lower lake level and minimum SWW influence between 11,300 and 7700 cal. yr BP. Precipitation then rose punctuated by centennial-scale variations since 6200 cal. yr BP. Chilean-European deforestation and spread of invasive exotic species started at ∼350 cal. yr BP aided by fire. We conclude that temperate rainforests have persisted with little interruption since T1, with major changes in floristic composition driven by climate change and fires. Rainforest composition and heterogeneity declined in response to Chilean/European disturbance during the 1600s and intensified since the 1800s. These events constitute the fastest/largest-magnitude vegetation changes of the last ∼25,000 years.","Southern westerly winds,Vegetation history,Last glacial termination,Fire disturbance,Holocene,Last glacial maximum,Northwestern patagonia,"

"variability of lightning flash and thunderstorm over east/southeast asia on the enso time scales","2016","The variability of lightning flash and thunderstorm on the ENSO time scales over East/Southeast Asia was investigated by using 17-year (1995–2011) lightning data from the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), and 14-year (1998–2011) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite (TRMM) precipitation feature data. In addition, ERA-Interim reanalysis data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were used to present related environmental characteristics. It was found that the response of lightning flash to ENSO events shows remarkable seasonal and regional variations. The regions of positive (negative) lightning anomaly are mainly located at both sides of 5°–20°N (5°–15°N) in El Niño (La Niña) spring and winter, and located north of the equator in summer and autumn. There is a significantly positive correlation between lightning anomaly and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) over both East China and Indonesia during El Niño episodes, but no obvious correlation during La Niña episodes. The positive thunderstorm anomalies during El Niño periods are dispersed. The distribution of thunderstorm anomalies in La Niña summer and autumn is almost opposite to that in spring and winter. The correlation between thunderstorm anomaly and ONI is better over East China than that over Indonesia. In general, lightning variation follows thunderstorm intensity (number) variation over East China during El Niño (La Niña) episodes, and follows a combination of thunderstorm intensity and number variations over Indonesia on ENSO time scales. During ENSO time scales, variations of surface wind can be considered as one of the key factors to LAs. More lightning flashes present in the regions where warm moist flows intersection, and less in the regions where surface wind changes slightly or diverges. Dramatic lightning increases also occur with higher values of convective available potential energy (CAPE). In addition, higher (lower) 850hPa relative humidity generally follows with more (less) lightning flashes, which is more obvious during El Niño episodes.","Lightning,ENSO,East/Southeast Asia,Meteorological factor,Thunderstorm,"

"the first detection of the madden-julian oscillation signal in daily to hourly resolution proxy records derived from a natural archive of giant clam shell (tridacna spp.)","2021","The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the most prominent mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropics which is responsible for much of the observed intraseasonal climate variance not only there but also in higher latitudes. The short time-span of modern instrumental data limits our understanding of the MJO and obtaining MJO information from natural archives could extend this greatly. Here a Giant Clam shell (Tridacna spp.) with a life span about two years (from January 29, 2012 to December 9, 2013) was collected from the northern South China Sea, in the western Pacific. Several daily to hourly resolution biological and geochemical proxy records, including the daily growth rate, hourly Fe/Ca, Sr/Ca and fluorescence intensity, were developed to compare these with local weather/climate records. Spectral analyses suggested that these ultra-high resolution proxy records can clearly record MJO variability in the tropics. The substantial connection between the proxy records and MJO possibly linking through the local effective solar radiation, SST, precipitation and wind speeds. This is the first record of the MJO signal in a natural paleoclimate archive.

"scale-adaptive multiple-obstacle tracking with occlusion handling in maritime scenes","2016","Scale adapting and occlusion handling are two important issues in visual tracking, but usually tricky for many algorithms to address them efficiently. In this paper, we propose a framework for multiple-obstacle tracking in maritime scenes with the aid of depth information, which renders the vital clue for scale adapting and occlusion handling. In the proposed framework, each detected obstacle is tracked by an independent tracker respectively, and the depth of an obstacle is obtained by computing the disparity between the obstacle centers in left and right rectified images. Thereafter, the bounding box scale of a tracked obstacle is adapted according to its linear relationship to the depth. When occlusion occurs, the occluded obstacle is terminated to track, and when it reappears, the same identity number before occluding is assigned to it to keep the tracking consistent. Experimental results on our own dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach performs superiorly to the state-of-the-art tracking method in terms of scale adapting and occlusion handling.","Stereo vision,remotely operated vehicles,robot vision,Cameras,obstacle tracker,scale-adaptive multiple-obstacle tracking,depth information,Vehicles,object tracking,Target tracking,Sea surface,visual tracking,Context,obstacle detection,maritime scenes,Boats,occlusion handling,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,multiple-obstacle tracking,"
"gis-based identification of spatial variables enhancing heat and poor air quality in urban areas","2012","Due to anthropogenic climate change heat waves are expected to occur more frequently in the future, which might cause adverse health effects for urban population. Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist. In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000). Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic. A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites. The results of the chemical analyses support the results obtained from geo-statistical modeling. It reveals high concentrations of health relevant airborne species like metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the zone of enhanced risk for the coincidence of temperature stress and PM pollution.","Heat,Air pollution,Health,Particulate matter,Climate change,GIS,"
"an efficient and controllable capsule network for classification of maritime moving targets","2023","The accurate classification of maritime moving targets under complex sea conditions is a very important task.

More stations showing statistically significant increases than decreases in spring, summer and autumn SMPs were found while there was a statistically significant decrease (increase) in winter SMP over southern (northern) Canada. LTP significantly increased the likelihood of trends detected in AMPs and SMPs. The effects of STP on the trend detection were also evident as shown by the differences in results obtained from the MK tests with and without considering the effect of STP. The effects of large-scale climate anomalies on trends were significant for winter SMPs. More than 1/4 of stations were detected with statistically significant change points in AMPs and SMPs which occurred around 1960–1990.

This paper proposes a fusion system for context-based situation and threat assessment with application to harbor surveillance. The architecture of the system is organized in two levels. The lowest level uses an ontological model to formally represent input data and to classify harbor objects and basic situations by deductive reasoning according to the harbor regulations.

"trial results of a new low-cost and covert technology to trace the path of maritime containers worldwide","2008","There are approximately 7 million maritime style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the USA. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5% of the maritime containers, that arrive in or transition through North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites and they are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low cost, low power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than 10$ per container. This paper presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are to be conducted in 2009) of such a low cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Maritime container traceability,Costs,Inspection,low-cost covert technology,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,ships,Containers,alternative man-made signal,high DC power,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Article traceability,Globalization,market globalization,maritime containers path,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Power generation economics,Security,"

The flexibility of this system also provides favorable conditions for moving target detection. Aiming at the problems of moving target detection, velocity estimation, and imaging of SAR maritime scenes in the spaceborne multi-channel system, this paper proposes a set of processes based on coarse imaging, detection, velocity estimation and refocusing.

"towards enhanced recognized maritime picture","2022","Situational awareness (SA) is a crucial element set before the military organizations. It provides a real-time view of activities in a specific area and forms a basis for the decision- making. The maritime setting involves operations in a Multi-Domain space. An important segment in achieving the SA involves the creation of a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP). The RMP presents the relevant maritime information based on the process that involves detection, classification and assessment before they can be further distributed and actions taken. Croatia, as a maritime country and NATO member, is expected to maintain such capabilities. To this end, various tools have been developed or procured that form the backbone of today's operational information system. Yet, contemporary challenges are setting new requirements and it is necessary to continue transformation in order to maintain this capability as well as compatibility with the partner countries. This paper starts with presentation of the important elements required to understand the SA and RMP concepts in the naval context. It provides an overview of the efforts that Croatia has invested to develop its own systems that support the creation of RMP and their current status. Furthermore, following membership, conditions have been created for greater technical integration with other NATO operational users in support of the enhanced MSA and Command and Control (C2). Finally, we present trends and guidelines recommending further development of these systems that are necessary in order to maintain this capability and achieve greater integration with allies.","Organizations,SA,Command and Control,marine systems,Croatia,marine engineering,information systems,Information Systems,military organizations,operational information system,NATO,decision making,situational awareness,Real-time systems,command and control systems,Situational Awareness,Recognized Maritime Picture,naval context,RMP,Command and control systems,maritime information,multidomain space,Market research,Information systems,command and control,Guidelines,"
"phenological and seismological impacts on airborne pollen types: a case study of olea pollen in the region of murcia, mediterranean spanish climate","2022","The rationale of this paper was to investigate whether earthquakes impact airborne pollen concentrations, considering some meteorological parameters. Atmospheric pollen concentrations in the Region of Murcia Aerobiological Network (Spain) were studied in relation to the occurrence of earthquakes of moment magnitude (up to Mw = 5.1) and intensity (intensity up to grade VII on the European Macroseismic Scale). In this study, a decade (2010–2019) was considered across the cities of the network. Earthquakes were detected in 12 out of 1535 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Cartagena, 49 out of 1481 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Lorca, and 39 out of 1441 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Murcia. The Olea pollen grains in this network were attributed to the species Olea europaea, i.e., the olive tree, a taxon that appears widely in the Mediterranean basin, in both cultivated and wild subspecies. Differences between the Olea concentration on days with and without earthquakes were only found in Lorca (Kruskal-Wallis: p-value = 0.026). The low frequency and intensity of the earthquakes explained these results. The most catastrophic earthquake felt in Lorca on May 11th, 2011 (IVII, Mw = 5.1, 9 casualties) did not result in clear variations in pollen concentrations, while meteorology (e.g., African Dust Outbreak) might have conditioned these pollen concentrations. The research should be broadened to other active seismological areas to reinforce the hypothesis of seismological impact on airborne pollen concentrations.","Intensity,Magnitude,Airborne pollen,African Dust Outbreak,Earthquake,"
"development of denoising and compression algorithms for ais-based vessel trajectories","2022","Ship navigation information derived from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) is widely used in the shipping industry. As AIS reports are featured with huge volume and noises, preprocessing of AIS data is essential before its further application. This study aims to develop effective algorithms to denoise and compress raw trajectories derived from AIS reports. Specifically, an effective noise detection method based on statistical theory and sliding window is first proposed to identify glitches in a given trajectory. Linear interpolation is further used to rectify the glitches detected. Then, two modes of algorithms are proposed for trajectory compression: static mode with preset threshold for compression and dynamic mode considering the distance between trajectory points and the coastline in a real-time manner. Numerical experiments show that the noise detection and rectification algorithms and the trajectory compression algorithms are accurate and highly efficient considering compression rate, information loss, and computation time. The main innovation of this research includes developing an accurate and robust trajectory glitch detection and rectification algorithm, proposing two modes of trajectory compression algorithms, and combining the two tasks in a holistic robust framework. Especially, the dynamic compression mode can overcome a major problem encountered in static compression where the compressed trajectories may go across land. It can also deal with more flexible compression requirements and thus should be more applicable in practice.","Trajectory denoising,Trajectory compression,Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory point-coastline distance,Dynamic threshold,"
"extended data plane architecture for in-network security services in software-defined networks","2023","Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies improve the dependability and resilience of networks by enabling administrators to spawn and scale-up traffic management and security services in response to dynamic network conditions. However, in practice, they often suffer from poor performance and require complex configurations because network packets must be ‘detoured’ to each virtualized security service, which expends bandwidth and increases network propagation delay. To address these challenges, we propose a new SDN-based data plane architecture, called DPX (Data Plane eXtension), that natively supports in-network security services. The DPX action model reduces redundant processing caused by frequent packet parsing and provides administrators with a simplified (and less error-prone) method for configuring security services into the network. DPX also increases the efficiency of enforcing complex security policies by introducing a novel technique called action clustering, which aggregates security actions from multiple flows into a small number of synthetic rules. Also, the application of action clustering (i.e., advanced and global) provides more diverse policies and network-wide detection. We present an implementation of DPX in hardware using NetFPGA-SUME and in software using Open vSwitch. We evaluate the performance of the DPX prototype and the efficacy of its flow-table simplifications against a range of complex network policies exposed to line rates of 10 Gbps.","Data plane,Network security,Network function virtualization (NFV),Openflow,Software-defined networking (SDN),"

"a comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system","2020","The safety and reliability of ship navigation depend heavily on the performance of the marine machinery system, which can be maintained at a high level by condition based maintenance. Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.","One-class classifier,Marine machinery,Condition based maintenance,Condition monitoring,"
"case study of ground penetration radar (gpr) to assess lead migration","2023","This paper describes research to characterize subsurface contamination caused by leaching of lead (Pb) from batteries disposed of at the surface, which has spread with groundwater movement. The contaminated soils and aquifer are located in the Matano formation (Sulawesi, Indonesia). Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was used to detect and delineate Pb-contaminated soils (i.e., solid-phase Pb). Lead in the solid and aqueous phase have different characteristics and responses when subjected to electromagnetic (EM) waves. Many studies have used GPR to map solid-phase Pb contamination in the subsurface. GPR uses EM as the base medium to receive subsurface images and is useful for the detection of solid-phase Pb contamination but cannot detect aqueous-phase Pb. The first step in the remediation process was to delineate solid-phase Pb contamination in the subsurface using GPR, which required a geotechnical survey to support GPR. Samples of soil and aquifer solids were then taken to quantify lead concentrations using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). We collected 15 lines of GPR measurements and 11 soil samples to quantify Pb. Frequencies of 600 MHz and 900 MHz were used for the GPR antenna. The results identified a clay layer at a depth of between 3 m and 4 m, which appears to have served as barrier to downward migration of Pb-contaminated groundwater. A shadow zone and low reflectance in the GPR subsurface section images were used to identify as the Pb contamination, which has a distinct wavelength ranging between 0.36 m and 0.45 m. We conclude from the results of this study that GPR was an effective tool for the delineation of the vertical and horizontal spread of Pb contamination eastward from the source.","Lead,Low reflectance,Ground penetrating radar,Delineation,"

"induction motor short circuit diagnosis and interpretation under voltage unbalance and load variation conditions","2023","Predictions from machine learning algorithms have often supported decision-making in industrial processes. Despite this, complex models can be challenging to interpret, sometimes shrouding the entire prediction process in an undesirable mystery. Understanding how the classifiers’ recommendations are made helps human experts understand the phenomenon and develop better data-driven solutions. Therefore, this study takes advantage of Shapley additive explanations to explain the predictions obtained by the classifier and select the most appropriate features for the approaches. The experiments use extreme gradient boosting to evaluate temporal, spectral, and wavelet features of three-phase induction motor current signals. The proposed approach effectively reduces the number of attributes without losing performance, provides an understanding of how each feature affects the model over a wide range of voltage unbalances and torque values, and detects early inter-turn short circuits with severity of 1%. The results show that combining the intelligent model with Shapley explanations improves stator winding fault diagnosis in these highly problematic situations.","Inter-turn short circuit,Explainable artificial intelligence,Shapley additive explanations,Fault diagnosis,Induction machines,Machine learning,"

The issues of software implementation of the proposed method and the formation of a data set containing network packets are considered.

"deep learning applied to road accident detection with transfer learning and synthetic images","2022","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has driven solutions in diverse areas; one of the most prominent fields is Computer Vision (CV). Accordingly, solutions to effectively detect road accidents can be a game-changer for road safety. The focus is on Vision Zero, i.e., eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries. However, when an accident occurs, response time is essential. Several countries have surveillance cameras monitoring the road network. However, real-time monitoring requires a considerable number of people with training and attention. Our solution automates this with AI, using deep learning to train a model to detect potential accidents. The CV method based on binary image classification was used, being images without accidents classified as normal and images with accidents as alarm. The biggest challenge in developing the model was obtaining images of accidents from the analyzed cameras. The solution adopted was to create synthetic images of these rare events. Several architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks were tested, and it was found that the best approach was to use transfer learning. As base models for transfer learning, the best results were EfficientNetB1 and MobileNetV2. The former for its quality in prediction and the latter for its size and execution speed. As a case study, open data images from Finnish road surveillance cameras were used, provided every ten minutes. Finally, it was found that the solution trained with EfficientNetB1 as the base model has a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.89 and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.77. The solution based on MobileNetV2 has an mAP of 0.88 and an MCC of 0.71.","Road Accidents,Computer Vision,Deep Learning,Image Classification,Transfer Learning,Synthetic Data,"
"graph-based ship traffic partitioning for intelligent maritime surveillance in complex port waters","2023","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.","Graph partitioning,Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Maritime knowledge extraction,AIS data,"
"maritime uav patrol tasks based on yolov4 object detection","2022","The search and rescue operations conducted by designated maritime patrol troops usually employ ships and helicopters in their search and rescue work at sea, making it a resource-intensive undertaking both in terms of patrolling equipment and trained personnel. Oftentimes, when the victims send an SOS or call for help, the rescue unit in question can easily obtain the ship's information but cannot access prevailing maritime images of the sea, thus hindering them from swiftly controlling the accident site as effectively. This work endeavors to address this deficiency and proposes an automated patrolling operation based on small UAVs and a diverse set of maritime search patterns corresponding to different sea areas. Maritime images are collected via a deep neural network-based UAV and promptly returned to the search and rescue system. The object detection model in this case is trained using extensive images of maritime accidents collected from the network. This object detection model based on the YOLOv4 framework is thus used in the timely detection of maritime accidents. Post detection, an alarm system is set up to classify the danger level of the targets and to trigger rescue operations corresponding to the level of danger, followed by an alarm message sent to the rescuers by Short Message Service (SMS).

Here, we provide a review of different types of seasonality preserved by stalagmites and methods for extracting this information. A new drip classification scheme is introduced, which facilitates the identification of stalagmites fed by seasonally responsive drips and which highlights the wide variability in drip types feeding stalagmites. This hydrological variability, combined with seasonality in Earth atmospheric processes, meteoric precipitation, biological processes within the soil, and cave atmosphere composition means that every stalagmite retains a different and distinct (but correct) record of environmental conditions. Replication of a record is extremely useful but should not be expected unless comparing stalagmites affected by the same processes in the same proportion. A short overview of common microanalytical techniques is presented, and suggested best practice discussed. In addition to geochemical methods, a new modelling technique for extracting meteoric precipitation and temperature palaeoseasonality from stalagmite δ18O data is discussed and tested with both synthetic and real-world datasets.

"hkpm: a hierarchical key-area perception model for hfswr maritime surveillance","2022","High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) has become the cornerstone of maritime surveillance because of its low-cost maintenance and coverage of wide area. However, when it comes to the extraction of key areas, such as vessel-target detection and vessel-path tracking, the HFSWR signal is strongly interfered by clutters and noise, which makes maritime surveillance a challenging task. This article proposes a hierarchical key-area perception model for maritime surveillance harnessing range-Doppler (RD) image from HFSWR, Laplacian kernel, a linear classifier (LC), and a subnet-based multilayer representation learning framework (SMRLF). First, a weak LC with a Laplacian kernel is utilized to capture the plausible vessel regions (PVRs). Then, a novel SMRLF is proposed to localize the vessel targets from the PVRs. To handle the noise, a maximum correntropy criterion with variable centers (MCC-VC) is incorporated in the subnet-based learning model. A thorough experimental analysis on cross-domain samples from radar dataset to scene classification dataset shows that the proposed HKPM performs competitively. The model shows a superior performance over most of the state-of-the-art vessel-target detection algorithms with a vessel-target detection accuracy of 94%.

"maritime vessel route extraction and automatic information system (ais) spoofing detection","2021","Automated Identification System (AIS) comprises of a global real-time network of maritime vessels, transmitters, and satellite or ground-station receivers, which are used to track and record time-stamped static (vessel-id, type, etc.) and dynamic (location, course, speed, etc.) information of all maritime vessels. Traditionally, this data feed has been used by vessel traffic services to avoid vessel collisions, however increasingly, marine researchers and data scientists have shown interest in developing algorithms on historical AIS data-dumps with diverse objectives such as estimating trends in global ocean-currents, maritime logistical planning, fishing fleet monitoring and enhancing maritime security. This paper aims to propose a novel shipping-route extraction algorithm to process historical AIS data (running into tens of gigabytes of daily data, from more than a hundred thousand maritime vessels), to effectively characterize global shipping route behaviour and capture its seasonal trends. This is done by formulating a sigmoid based turning waypoint identification, which does not solely depend on the change in the course of a vessel, derived from AIS message. The AIS data is further processed to excerpt the vesselâ€™s distance from the nearest port and nearest shore with resolution of about 1 km, which forms a handy metric for the identification of suspicious ports. Several other use cases are also explored, which include detecting various anomalies in individual vessel behaviour such as intentional or unintentional switching off AIS transmission, shipping-lane deviations, spoofing transmission messages. To tackle spoofing anomaly, various spoofing identification methods are discussed. A region-based spoofing identification algorithm is developed to identify spoofing points under multiple categories using a clustering algorithm. All the results are visualized through an open-source map overlay.

"a novel autoencoder based feature independent ga optimised xgboost classifier for iomt malware detection","2024","The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has a network of interconnected medical devices to capture patients' health metrics and store them in a centralized server for analysis by medical experts. The security concerns in IoMT data are therefore very high. The attackers may inject malware into the IoMT data during its transmission. If the health parameters are affected by malware it may mislead the medical experts in making inferences about the patient’s health. IoMT devices are resource-constrained and require faster analysis of data for better medical assistance. Most of the classification techniques used earlier suffer from exhaustive time and resource consumption. Hence, developing an intelligent framework that could reduce the data size and classify the malware quickly is essential. This paper proposes a deep learning framework called Auto-encoder to encode the IoMT data. The encoded features are then given to an XGBoost Classifier whose hyperparameters are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm. XGBoost Classifier detects the presence of malware in the IoMT dataset and Clamp dataset with an accuracy of 98.98% and 98.69% respectively. This lightweight model achieves dimensionality reduction through Autoencoder and effectively detects malware through an optimized XGBoost classifier with faster convergence and limited computational costs. Implementing this framework on the fog layer provides promising results by optimizing resource usage and saving time compared to previous works. Moreover, the proposed method does not need explicit feature selection from the dataset when making predictions.","XGBoost classifier,Genetic algorithm,Auto-encoder,Hyper- parameter tuning,Internet of Medical Things (IoMT),"

"detecting sophisticated attacks in maritime environments using hybrid situational awareness","2019","In recent years, the growing emergence of digitalization and data explosion has altered the threat dynamics in the maritime sector. The interconnected Maritime Critical Infrastructures are highly attracted by cybercriminals, who are constantly evolving their tactics, committing complex, sophisticated attacks causing a tremendous impact to economic and social life. Such intrusions engage multi-vector, composite attacks exploiting existing vulnerabilities from both the physical and the cyber domain. Current risk assessment approaches and countermeasure strategies fail to gather an overview of the maritime physical and cyber threat landscape. This work describes a method to detect and counter such sophisticated attacks by applying a Hybrid Situational Awareness model. This model allows to generate a holistic picture of the security condition within Maritime Critical Infrastructures considering the potential cascading effects of such combined cyberphysical attacks. Furthermore, the current work presents some illustrative examples, which show how the Hybrid Situational Awareness model can be integrated into maritime environments to detect potential future coordinated attacks and how it can facilitate the communication with first responders and emergency organizations of a city in case of a crisis.","Markov processes,complex attacks,event correlation,hybrid situational awareness model,cybercriminals,computer crime,cyber domain,Monitoring,social life,Organizations,economic life,marine engineering,digitalization,maritime environments,risk management,composite attacks,multivector,Correlation,cyberphysical attacks,Critical infrastructure,critical infrastructures,cyber threat landscape,data explosion,risk assessment,holistic approach,threat dynamics,Sensors,maritime sector,threat propagation,sophisticated attacks,Hybrid Situational Awareness,Security,interconnected maritime critical infrastructures,"
"anomaly detection and tracking based on meanâ€“reverting processes with unknown parameters","2019","Piecewise mean-reverting stochastic processes have been recently proposed and validated as an effective model for long-term object prediction. In this paper, we exploit the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) dynamic model to represent an anomaly as any deviation of the long-run mean velocity from the nominal condition. This amounts to modeling the anomaly as an unknown switching control input that can affect the dynamics of the object. Under this model, the problem of joint anomaly detection and tracking can be addressed within the Bayesian random set framework by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially estimates a Bernoulli random set (empty under nominal behavior) for the unknown long-run mean velocity, and a random vector for the kinematic state of the object. An additional challenge is represented by the fact that two extra parameters, i.e. the reversion rate and the noise covariance of the underlying OU process, need to be specified for Bayes-optimal prediction. We propose a multiple-model adaptive filter (MMA-HBF) for anomaly detection, tracking and simultaneous estimation of the OU unknown parameters. The effectiveness of these tools is demonstrated on a simulated maritime scenario.","random finite sets,Kinematics,Bernoulli random set,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Mathematical model,Switches,mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,OU unknown parameters,sequential estimation,piecewise mean-reverting stochastic processes,target tracking,stochastic processes,unknown long-run mean velocity,hybrid Bernoulli filter,random processes,simulated maritime scenario,nominal condition,long-term object prediction,Bayes-optimal prediction,noise covariance,anomaly tracking,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,underlying OU process,multiple-model approach,multiple-model adaptive filter,adaptive filters,unknown switching control input,random vector,"
"an unsupervised approach to automatic object extraction from a maritime video scene","2014","In this paper, an efficient unsupervised approach for extracting objects from maritime background using solely still video images is proposed. Its main idea is that maritime background (sea) has the main particularity of absorbing only hot light frequencies (red and green), while an object has not this property. Therefore if a timely vector of class features is considered, then two distinct statistical classes can be easily obtained in one maritime image, using an appropriate unsupervised two-class classification algorithm, and thus one can efficiently extract object from background. This is achieved by firstly partitioning a maritime image into equally-sized blocks, and constructing a 13-dimensional block-wise feature vector (regardless of block size) based on some observed statistics of light absorption in a block. The latter capture at the same time the characteristics (higher-order geometric moments) of the Fourier spectrum of RGB intensities in an image block, and its Shannon entropies. Both types of RGB information allow together generally to characterize well background versus object regions. Furthermore, a mere statistical test makes it possible to detect situations where there is no object in a maritime video scene but only sea. We have tested the proposed approach using several maritime scene videos and it has shown good performances in terms of detection accuracy, robustness and computational time.","Shannon entropies,Green products,geometry,unsupervised two-class classification algorithm,unsupervised classification,Absorption,Vectors,unsupervised learning,Cameras,Maritime video scene,statistical test,RGB intensities,automatic object extraction,marine engineering,statistical testing,object detection,image block,image classification,Entropy,higher-order geometric moments,Object segmentation,video signal processing,Robustness,Fourier spectrum,maritime video scene,Shannon entropy,"

"maritime surveillance with undersampled sar","2017","According to the minimum antenna area constraint, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems require a low-pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to image the wide swaths in ocean surface monitoring scenarios. However, the low PRF that is lower than the Doppler bandwidth will cause azimuth ambiguities. This letter proposes a novel method of mitigating azimuth ambiguities when using an undersampled SAR system for ship detection over the open sea. In this letter, the concept of range subspectra is adopted to misregister the azimuth ambiguity signals. In addition, a change detection method that uses a principal component analysis and k-means clustering is adopted to detect differences in the azimuth ambiguities between two range subspectra images in which the azimuth ambiguities are misregistered. By compensating for the ambiguities in the corresponding image, the ambiguities can be mitigated. This method is only appropriate for bright targets over dark backgrounds in which residual energy loss occurs for useful signals. Both simulated and real data processing results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it is feasible for maritime surveillance.","two range subspectra images,ship detection,low-pulse repetition frequency,change detection method,azimuth ambiguity mitigation method,bright targets,Principal component analysis,range subspectrum,Synthetic aperture radar,undersampled,undersampled SAR system,image ambiguities,maritime surveillance,Azimuth ambiguities,real data processing,synthetic aperture radar,ocean surface monitoring scenarios,azimuth ambiguity signals,range subspectra concept,Doppler effect,dark backgrounds,Bandwidth,Azimuth,Doppler bandwidth,residual energy loss,open sea,Imaging,synthetic aperture radar systems,principal component analysis,Barium,minimum antenna area,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),k-mean clustering,oceanographic techniques,"
"dealing with seafood toxins: present approaches and future options","1995","In most maritime countries, the seafood industry is an important source of revenue and accounts for a significant portion of the country's food supply. However, certain seafood, in particular shellfish, may become contaminated with naturally occurring toxins. The existence of shellfish toxins has been known for centuries and early attempts to deal with this threat led to the creation of folklore rituals and religious customs among tribal and ethnic groups. Eventually it was found that these toxins are produced by microbial organisms, usually phytoplankton, that occur naturally in the ocean. In Canada, as well as other countries with cold or temperate coastal waters, three groups of toxins are of particular importance and these are the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins, the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) toxin. Since it is virtually impossible to prevent the occurrence of these toxins, the approach in modern times has been to monitor seafood for the presence or absence of toxins using a standardized mouse bioassay. However, not all toxins can be detected effectively by this method and there is a trend in several countries to dispense with the mouse bioassay. Furthermore, there are differences between countries as to the preferred method of sampling and analysis and there is not agreement between all countries concerning tolerance levels of the various toxins in seafood. These difficulties, the occurrence of new toxins, and the rapid expansion of the shellfish aquaculture industry have put considerable pressure upon the scientific community to develop new methods of coping with these toxins, including more sensitive chemical or biochemical assays that are rapid and inexpensive. The possibilities and options for coping with these ubiquitous toxins are presented and discussed.","monitoring,phytoplankton,detection methods,shellfish,Seafood toxins,"
"annual ice volume changes 1976–2008 for the new zealand southern alps","2012","New Zealand has a long, continuous record of annual end-of-summer-snowline measurements for a set of Southern Alps ‘index glaciers’ from 1977 to present. These index glaciers are used to estimate annual mass balance and volume water equivalent changes for the over 3000 glaciers on the Southern Alps. Two methods are employed to monitor ice volume changes. Method I deals with the rapid to normal response time glaciers, which tend to be small to medium in size. It uses mass balance gradients and glacier areas to convert changes in snowlines to changes in ice volume water equivalent. Ice volume changes for the period 1976–2008 are calculated for each index glacier, and then extrapolated to most other glaciers of the Southern Alps, using the New Zealand glacier inventory. Method II deals with 12 protracted response glaciers, which tend to be large in size. These have been slow in reacting to a long-term regional warming trend. Instead they still largely retain the ablation areas of a century ago and are in a state of disequilibrium with the present climate. These valley glaciers have recently sustained substantial ice losses that are not able to be detected using Method I. Mass balance deficits and ablation from the 12 large protracted response glaciers are estimated using a geodetic approach based on topographic and lake changes determined from repeated surveys. Results show that estimated ice volume (in water equivalents) for the Southern Alps has decreased from 54.5km3 in 1976 to 46.1km3 by 2008. This equates to a rate of −0.3km3a−1 over the last three decades, but this is considerably less than the rate of ice volume loss estimated for the previous 100years. More than 3000 small and medium-size glaciers account for just 29% of the overall ice volume loss from the Southern Alps, while 71% of the loss occurs from the 12 large protracted response glaciers. Terminus calving contributes 0.8km3 and down-wasting of ice tongues in the ablation zone contributes 5.2km3. Some preliminary results show that ice volume changes are related to changes in circulation over the New Zealand region.","End-of-summer snowline,Ice volume,Glacier mass balance,Proglacial lake,Climate connections,ELA,"
"solar and tropical ocean forcing of late-holocene climate change in coastal east asia","2017","In this study, paleoclimate signals were extracted from high-resolution sediment records very recently produced from the Mulyoungari swamp on Jeju Island, South Korea and examined to determine the main factors driving late Holocene climate change in East Asia. The high resolution of the Mulyoungari records allows the detection of multidecadal to centennial-scale climate change with various cycles. This enables comparisons with important paleoclimate proxies such as total solar irradiation (ΔTSI) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western tropical Pacific (WTP). Spectral analyses of pollen and magnetic susceptibility (MS) data identify significant periodicities of 780, 470, 135–145, and 50–70years. The Mulyoungari swamp responded sensitively to global climate change during the Holocene, showing well known Holocene cycles in the results. Our tree pollen index of warmness (TPIW) shows important late Holocene cold events associated with low sunspot periods such as Oort, Wolf, Spörer, and Maunder Minimum. Comparisons among standard Z-scores of filtered TPIW, ΔTSI, and other paleoclimate records from central and northeastern China, off the coast of northern Japan, southern Philippines, and Peru all demonstrate significant relationships. This suggests that solar activity drove Holocene variations in both East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In particular, the latter seems to have predominantly controlled the coastal climate of East Asia to the extent that the influence of precession was nearly muted during the late Holocene.","Western tropical Pacific,East Asian Monsoon,Late Holocene,Solar activity,Jeju Island,El Niño Southern-Oscillation,"
"a review of the application performances of concentrated solar power systems","2019","The global energy production model is changing from fossil fuels to renewable and nuclear energies. Concentrated solar power is one of the growing technologies that is leading this process. This growth implies the sophistication and size of the systems and, therefore, it requires an increase in maintenance tasks to ensure reliability, availability, maintainability and safety. The aim of this paper is to describe the current context of concentrated solar power, to summarise and analyse the main degradation mechanisms and the main techniques to detect, prevent and mitigate these faults. An exhaustive literature study is presented, considering the most advanced techniques and approaches. A novel qualitative and quantitative analysis of the literature is provided. Finally, the current trends and the future challenges in this field are gathered from this study.","Fault detection,Concentrated solar power,Fault prevention,Survey,Maintenance,"
"a generic and modular architecture for maritime autonomous vehicles","2018","Autonomous systems face the challenge of managing disruptive events such as internal alterations, mission updates and environmental perturbations that always occur in an operational context.

This generic and modular architecture implements high level capabilities in a semiautonomous or autonomous manner, and is deployed at a lower level on a heterogeneous swarm of vehicles.

"insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for orkney waters and the pentland firth, ne scotland","2014","The Orkney archipelago has a rich heritage that includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, Viking settlements, harbours supplying Hudson's Bay Company ships, and the wartime naval base of Scapa Flow. This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.",""

"a context-aware approach for vessels’ trajectory prediction","2023","An accurate vessel trajectory prediction can improve safety management at sea. Although the vessels' trajectories can be affected by complex and high dimensional context factors such as wind, wave size, and current, the research in incorporating them in trajectory prediction is still burgeoning. This paper proposes a context-aware data-driven framework for vessel trajectory prediction. In this regard, trajectories are enriched with context information at the first stage. This includes evaluating methods of trajectory annotation. Next, feature selection techniques are applied to solve the problems caused by high dimensionality, i.e., incensement in the complexity and the computational load. Finally, selected factors are used in a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network. The implementations on the Automatic Identification System (AIS), weather, and ocean condition dataset around the English Channel collected during February 2016, indicated that the spline interpolation is suitable for trajectory annotation. Water depth, wave direction, and height are the most influencing context in vessels’ data-driven movement prediction. The predictions made by the proposed framework are 15.31% more accurate than the prediction of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Therefore, the proposed context-aware trajectory prediction framework might suit maritime systems and applications like collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection.",""
"image segmentation-based oil slick detection using sar radarsat-2 osvn maritime data","2017","Oil spills present a major threat to the sea ecosystem and thus need to be monitored on a regular basis.

"bayesian filtering for dynamic anomaly detection and tracking","2022","This article presents a Bayesian approach for sequential detection of anomalies in the motion of a target and joint tracking. The anomaly is modeled as a binary (on/off) switching unknown control input that goes into action (begins to exist, or â€œswitches onâ€) thereby modifying the object dynamics; and by ceasing its activity (becoming nonexistent, or â€œswitching offâ€) returns the dynamics to nominal. The developed Bayesian framework brings together random finite set (RFS) theory to represent the switching nature of the anomaly, and optimal joint input and state estimation to sequentially update a hybrid state that incorporates a random vector for the kinematic state and a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown control input. In addition, a closed-form solution, the Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter (GM-HBF), has been developed to provide a customized solution for dynamic anomaly detection in the maritime domain characterized by linear Gaussian target dynamics. Based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck dynamic model for vessels, where the evolution of the object velocity is governed by a piecewise mean-reverting stochastic process, the anomaly can be represented by a change in the long-run mean velocity (i.e., the unknown control input) from the nominal condition that forces the vessel to deviate from its standard route. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GM-HBF in both simulated and real-world maritime surveillance applications and test its performance in the face of false measurements, detection uncertainty, and sensor data gaps.","developed Bayesian framework,surveillance,kinematic state,Mathematical models,Anomaly detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Bayesian approach,random finite sets (RFSs),Bayesian filtering,Bayes methods,object dynamics,linear Gaussian target dynamics,Switches,Bernoulli filter,switching unknown control input,Radio frequency,target tracking,Aerodynamics,stochastic processes,filtering theory,radar,state estimation,detection uncertainty,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,dynamic anomaly detection,joint input and state estimation (JISE),probability,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic model,GM-HBF,Gaussian-mixture hybrid Bernoulli filter,"

"integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ert and limited drillings at the hepu han tombs, in coastal area of southern china","2019","The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds.

"change detection support for supervisory controllers of highly automated systems: effects on performance, mental workload, and recovery of situation awareness following interruptions","2018","Dynamic Positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled process to automatically keep a floating vessel at a specific position or to follow a pre-defined path (tracking) by using its own propellers and thrusters. The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.","Management-by-exception,Situation Awareness Recovery (SAR),Dynamic positioning,Human-automation collaboration,Out-of-the-loop (OOTL) performance problem,"
"autonomous mooring towards autonomous maritime navigation and offshore operations","2020","Bollard is a vital component of mooring system. It is the anchor point for mooring ropes to be fixed in order to secure the vessel or ship. An algorithm that translates the segmented mask of bollard output from masked R-CNN along with bounding box and associated class probability to its corresponding edge coordinate and finally to the single reference point for efficient detection and classification of bollard towards autonomous mooring is presented. At first stage, Mask R-CNN framework is trained with custom built bollard. The model obtained from the training is inferred with real data resulting in instance segment of bollard. The segmented mask obtained contains relatively large amount of the data points representing the whole area of bollard, which typically is not desirable. In order to precisely localize the bollard with one reference co-ordinate, the proposed algorithm is applied to segmented mask. Firstly, it translates the segmented mask to only four co-ordinate points, where each point correspond to the edge of bollard. Further, from the edges, the reference point is estimated. This causes significant reduction in point of interest (POI) and has potential to reduce the error encountered during pose estimation of the bollard in 3D thus making the autonomous mooring more precise and accurate.","Image edge detection,object detection and classification,remotely operated vehicles,autonomous mooring,masked R-CNN,robot vision,Marine vehicles,bounding box,reference point,data points,Industrial electronics,bollard output,pose estimation,Instance segmentation,marine systems,ships,POI,Three-dimensional displays,mooring ropes,object detection,Pose estimation,point of interest,class probability,anchor point,co-ordinate points,offshore operations,Training,segmented mask,probability,autonomous maritime navigation,Navigation,image segmentation,Mask R-CNN,"

"detecting dangerous maritime refugee migration paths through cell phone activities","2022","In the 21st century, the world has experienced devastating wars that have caused people to migrate, creating problems in host countries. Among these migration routes, maritime migration routes are more desirable compared to other routes because coasts cannot be controlled as strictly as the alternative passages. However, maritime migration poses life-threatening risks due to unsafe boats, transportation between undesignated areas, lack of life-saving equipment, and dangerous weather conditions chosen for covert operations. Refugees and migrants may die or go missing at sea during these migrations. Most refugees are unaware of high risks they are facing as they hopelessly set out in search of better living conditions. In this study, we propose that such suicide-like maritime migration activities can be detected to some extent through cell phone activities and there may be a way to track early signs of migrants coming together from other regions and migrating through sea routes. By collecting media reports of failed attempts by immigrants and linking them to the D4R cell phone data, we were able to gain some indications of the possibility of early warning systems through analysis of cell phone calls.","Media,D4R,Safety and security of immigrants,Maritime refugee mobility,host countries,Transportation,Safety,migrations,rebar,D4R cell phone data,seismology,refugees,life-threatening risks,Cellular phones,alarm systems,emergency services,cell phone activities,mobile handsets,cell phone calls,dangerous weather conditions,life-saving equipment,mobile computing,dangerous maritime refugee migration paths,sea routes,Alarm systems,Big Data,Boats,earthquake engineering,maritime migration routes,numerical analysis,Early detection of unsafe migration pathways,devastating wars,"

"threat assessment using context-based tracking in a maritime environment","2009","The main objective of this work is to model and exploit available maritime contextual information to provide a hypothesis on suspicious vessel maneuvers. This concept involves utilizing the L1 tracking to perform L2/L3 data fusion, i.e. refinement and assessment for situations and threats. A new context-based tracker known as the ConTracker is developed. The purpose of the ConTracker is to incorporate the contextual information into a traditional alpha - beta tracker in such a way so that it provides a repeller or an attractor characteristics to a specific region of interest. Any behavior of the vessel that is inconsistent with the repeller or the attractor characteristics of the current vessel location would be classified as suspicious. Such an inconsistent vessel behavior would be directly indicated by a high measurement residual which may be used to estimate an accurate process noise covariance using a multiple-model adaptive estimator.

"changes in water properties around north pacific intermediate water between the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s","2010","We detected temperature (salinity) decreases on the neutral density surfaces above the salinity minimum and increases below throughout the western North Pacific subtropical gyre (25∘N–40∘N, west of 170∘W) by comparing World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic sections from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The temperature (salinity) changes around the salinity minimum were associated with an apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) increase, and could not be explained by an increase of the subpolar input. These property changes were due to a density decrease of the salinity minimum. Furthermore, similar changes in temperature (salinity) were detected along 165∘E as a 12-year trend from 1996 to 2007. This suggests that the changes evident in the comparison of the WOCE sections are the representative of changes at the intermediate depths in the last decade. This pattern was not detected in the eastern subtropical gyre (25∘N–40∘N, east of 170∘W) and along 47∘N, where the AOU increase due to ventilation reduction has been reported. Along 47∘N, changes in temperature, salinity and AOU from 1999 to 2007 were opposite to those from 1985 to 1999.","Apparent oxygen utilization,Decadal change,NPIW,WHP,"
"health monitoring of marine composite structural joints using fibre optic sensors","2006","This paper describes a methodology for the health monitoring of composite marine joint structures based on strain measurements under operational loading using embedded fibre Bragg grating sensors. Finite element modelling indicated that the presence of a disbond significantly altered the bond-line longitudinal strain distribution. This was verified qualitatively through an experimental test program. The experimental results are examined in relation to the FE predictions and the implications for a practical strain-based SHM system are discussed. A technique is developed, based on novel signal processing and statistical outlier detection. This enables the sensor measurements to be used for damage detection without reference to a high-fidelity numerical model of the structure which is often difficult and resource-intensive to generate. The technique is shown to provide successful damage diagnoses with an acceptable level of accuracy. Further improvement in diagnostic accuracy may be achieved by increasing the sensor density.","Structural health monitoring,Model-independent,Bragg grating,Novelty detection,Composite joints,"
"full-view coverage quasi-mobile camera sensor network for maritime surveillance","2014","Coverage of a camera sensor network (CSN) is a critical issue in deploying such network in maritime environment. In such environment, camera sensors will not be stationary after the initial deployment due to the hostile sea environment. Hence, the mobility pattern poses a major limitation on identifying the time-varying coverage. In full-view coverage, target's facing direction has been introduced to judge whether a target's facing direction is guaranteed to be captured. To this end, we exploit full-view coverage in CSN, since image shots at the frontal viewpoint of a given target considerably increase the possibility to detect and recognize the target. In this paper, we have developed a mobility pattern based on wind speed and spring relaxation technique which are used to characterize the total displacement of a given buoy. Furthermore, the average percentage of full-view coverage has been evaluated based on different parameters such as equilateral triangle grid length, sensing radius of camera, wind speed and wave height. Consequently, the proposed model has been validated through MATLAB simulation platform.","surveillance,Surface waves,Cameras,MATLAB simulation platform,hostile sea environment,buoy,Wind speed,wireless sensor networks,time-varying coverage,maritime surveillance,cameras,Springs,equilateral triangle grid length,Sea surface,image shots,spring and sea wave,full-view coverage quasimobile camera sensor network,spring relaxation technique,sensing radius,wind speed,maritime environment,full-view coverage,wave height,mobility pattern,Sensors,Surveillance,facing direction,"
"predictive maintenance leveraging machine learning for time-series forecasting in the maritime industry","2020","One of the key challenges in the maritime industry refers to minimizing the time a vessel cannot be utilized, which has multiple effects. The latter is addressed through maintenance approaches that however in many cases are not efficient in terms of cost and downtime. Predictive maintenance provides optimized maintenance scheduling offering extended vessel lifespan, coupled with reduced maintenance costs. As in several industries, including the maritime domain, an increasing amount of data is made available through the deployment and exploitation of data sources, such as on board sensors that provide real-time information. These data provide the required ground for analysis and thus support for various types of data-driven decision making. In the maritime domain, sensors are deployed on vessels to monitor their engines and data analysis tools are needed to assist engineers towards reduced operational risk through predictive maintenance solutions that are put in place. In this paper, we present an approach for anomaly detection on time-series data, utilizing machine learning on the vessels sensor data, in order to predict the condition of specific parts of the vessel's main engine and thus facilitate predictive maintenance. The novel characteristic of the proposed approach refers both to the inclusion of new innovative models to address the case of predictive maintenance in maritime and the combination of those different models, highlighting an improved result in terms of evaluation metrics.","time-series forecasting,predictive maintenance leveraging machine,optimized maintenance scheduling,maritime,vessel lifespan,data-driven decision making,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,maintenance engineering,Machine learning,data sources,reduced maintenance costs,time-series,scheduling,time-series data,downtime,predictive maintenance,deep learning,Oils,data analysis,machine learning,Data models,maritime domain,real-time information,decision making,predictive maintenance solutions,time series,condition monitoring,permutation entropy,gradient boosting,Engines,maritime industry,Sensors,maintenance approaches,learning (artificial intelligence),Fuels,"
"the real-time reliable detection of the horizon line on high-resolution maritime images for unmanned surface-vehicle","2020","Horizon detection is useful in maritime image processing for various purposes, such as spatial orientation estimation of ship camera and detection of the significant region for post-processing. This paper proposed a novel realtime optimization-based method for detecting the horizon line in maritime images. Traditional methods defined the horizon line detection problem aim to detect the horizon line which perfectly divides the whole image into two regions as the sky and sea. Thus, the complication of traditional methods is the statistical distance metrics of distributions are calculated in the whole image by all combinations of the horizon line parameters. Moreover, traditional methods do not provide realtime processing to detect the horizon line from high-resolution images. To achieve real-time processing on high-resolution images, this study defines the local features of the horizon line using a vanishing line characteristic and the optimization criteria. In addition, the optimization process is improved by combining a genetic algorithm and a coarse-to-fine approach. Our method applied the Singapore marine dataset and the Buoy dataset. To verify the proposed method, our result is compared to the state of the art methods.

"synteo: synthetic dataset generation for earth observation and deep learning – demonstrated for offshore wind farm detection","2022","With the emergence of deep learning in the last years, new opportunities arose in Earth observation research. Nevertheless, they also brought with them new challenges. The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models demand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready datasets by merging existing and procedural data. SyntEO does this by including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic datasets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated dataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging environments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated, demonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset structure and influence the training process. SyntEO is thus a hybrid approach that creates an interface between expert knowledge and data-driven image analysis.","Offshore wind farm,Explainable machine learning,Synthetic training data,Deep learning,SyntEO,CNN,"
"lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies using landsat-8 and aster satellite data: north-eastern graham land, antarctic peninsula","2019","Antarctica remains a remote and logistically difficult region to conduct geological field mapping and mineral exploration. Remote sensing satellite imagery has high potential to provide a solution to overcome the difficulties and limitations associated with geological field mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions. In this study, the applications of Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were investigated to extract geological information for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions. The north-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected in this study to conduct a satellite-based remote sensing mapping approach. A two-stage methodology was adopted to distinguish pixel and sub-pixel targets in the satellite images. In the first stage, Continuum Removal (CR) spectral mapping tool and Independent Components Analysis (ICA) technique were applied to Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral bands to map the pixels related to poorly exposed lithological units. The second step was established based on the application of target detection algorithms to shortwave infrared bands of ASTER for detecting spectral features attributed to alteration mineral assemblages at the sub-pixel level. Pixels composed of distinctive absorption features of alteration mineral assemblages and Si-O bond emission minima features were detected by applying CR mapping tool to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. Anomaly pixels related to spectral features of Al-O–H, Fe, Mg-O–H and CO3 groups as well as lithological attributions from felsic to mafic rocks were detected by the implementation of ICA technique to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. ICA method provided image maps of alteration mineral assemblages and lithological units (mafic to felsic trend) for poorly mapped and/or unmapped regions. Fractional abundance of alteration minerals such as muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, epidote, chlorite and biotite were detected in poorly exposed lithologies using target detection algorithms. Several prospecting areas for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag mineralization related to propyllitically and argillically altered units of Andean Intrusive Suite (AIS) were identified in the southern sector of the study region. The results of this investigation demonstrated the applicability of Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral data for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions, particularly using the image processing algorithms that are capable of detecting anomaly pixels and sub-pixel targets in the remotely sensed images, where no prior information is available. In conclusion, a simple and robust satellite-based remote sensing approach for mapping poorly exposed lithologies in inaccessible regions was established, which is comprehensively applicable for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in the Antarctic environments and hydrothermal ore minerals prospecting in other inaccessible regions around the world.","Inaccessible regions,Landsat-8,Antarctic Peninsula,Graham Land,Poorly exposed lithologies,ASTER,Satellite-based remote sensing approach,"
"adaptive detection of spatial point event outliers using multilevel constrained delaunay triangulation","2016","Spatial outlier detection is a research hot spot in the field of spatial data mining. Because of the lack of specific research on spatial point events, this study presents an adaptive approach for spatial point events outlier detection (SPEOD) using multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation. First, the spatial proximity relationships between spatial point events are roughly captured by Delaunay triangulation. Then, three-level constraints are described and used to refine spatial proximity relationships with the consideration of statistical characteristics. Finally, those spatial point events connected by remaining edges are gathered to form a series of subgraphs. Those subgraphs containing very few point events are regarded as spatial outliers. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world spatial data sets are used to show that the proposed SPEOD algorithm can detect various types of spatial point event outliers with high efficiency. Moreover, there is no need to input any parameter in SPEOD.","Spatial point events,Multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation,Spatial outliers,"

"an iterative learning and inference approach to managing dynamic cyber vulnerabilities of complex systems","2020","As modern infrastructure systems become increasingly reliant on cyber technologies and continue to be integrated with physical systems, managing risks from deliberate and non-deliberate sources is a significant research challenge. Unlike strictly physical systems, cyber-enabled physical systems are influenced by dynamic and evolving technologies, environments, and attack mechanisms. As a result, vulnerabilities are rapidly changing and difficult to detect and manage. While there is recent interest in the dynamic properties of performance through resilience analysis, limited research addresses the dynamic nature of cyber-system vulnerability. This paper presents an iterative data-driven learning approach to evaluate and manage vulnerabilities for such complex systems. These time-varying system health characteristics may not be directly observable, but can be inferred using observable indicators. The approach recognizes that multiple types of vulnerabilities need to be included in a holistic system health assessment. The methods are applied to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) database containing thousands of documented cybersecurity vulnerabilities over nearly two decades. We acknowledge the dynamic properties of cyber vulnerability, while also inferring system health using observable data and hidden operational states. The results will be of interest to managers of large-scale cyber-enabled physical systems who are seeking to prioritize system health investments.","Markov model,Probabilistic inference,System resilience,Cybersecurity,Cyber vulnerability,Statistical learning,"

"context-based models to overcome operational challenges in maritime security","2015","Piracy and smuggling are major international problems which not only threaten maritime security but also affect the global economy. Even though NATO and international forces have been relentlessly fighting maritime crime in East Africa (Gulf of Aden), the problems still persist and maritime crime has moved to West Africa (Gulf of Guinea). In the same vein, the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) has had substantial operational success, controlling the vast geographical spread of smugglers in the East Pacific and Caribbean Sea. Due to limited number of maritime assets available, every resource needs to be efficiently allocated, both in time and space. This poses a great operational challenge requiring the integration and fusion of disparate information relevant to the mission and dynamic allocation of resources under uncertainty. Operational planning and execution for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy operations involve surveillance (to search, detect, track and identify potential threats) and interdiction operations (to intercept, investigate and potentially apprehend the suspects) in a dynamic and uncertain mission environment. In this paper, we present context-based models for counter-smuggling and counter-piracy missions, where the smuggling and piracy activities are represented in the form of color coded heat maps built using Intelligence information (INTEL), meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information and other mission-specific attributes (sensor observations, target types and their behavior, etc.); these maps are interpreted as probability of activity (PoA) surfaces.

"estimation of target detectability for maritime target tracking in the pda framework","2019","The detection probability of maritime vessels may change over time, either slowly or more abruptly, due to effects such as sea state and varying aspect angle. If the varying detectability is not accounted for in the tracking system, tracks may be terminated or lost.

In the following, we propose two methods for tracking targets with varying detection probability, both in the integrated probabilistic data association (IPDA) framework.

"organic contaminants in bats: trends and new issues","2014","Exposure to contaminants, often pesticides, has been implicated as a major factor contributing to decreases in bat populations. Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970–1980, 1981–1999 and 2000–2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05–2.31, 0.08–0.19ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000–2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term.","Bats,Organic contaminants,Pesticides,Mortality,"

The weights of the HOG features and CN features corresponding to the peak-to-sidelobe ratio are used as dynamic weight coefficients, and the maximum response value after their fusion is the area where the target may appear. Determine the target tracking status by calculating the tracking confidence of the response map, and when there is a tracking anomaly, the ECO_HC tracker is enhanced using the Kalman filter to re-predict the target position. The proposed algorithm has experimented on the OTB-50 dataset. The results show that our algorithm can cope with complex scenarios and improves by 3.0% in tracking accuracy and 2.8% in tracking success rate compared with the baseline algorithm ECO_HC.

"performance measures for airborne maritime surveillance radars","1998","A typical performance specification for an airborne maritime surveillance radar might be defined as the ability to detect, say, a 5 m/sup 2/ target in sea state 3 at a range of at least 25 nmi in clear air, with a detection probability of 0.9 and with one false alarm per minute. This is a basic statement of a user's needs but it is very inadequate as a specification of the radar performance that is actually required. The performance of an operational radar is characterised by many other features, which are not simply summarised in terms of a detection range and false alarm rate in a generalised environment. In particular, concepts such as probability of detection and probability of false alarm are conventionally steady state performance measures, for operation in thermal noise or uniformly distributed clutter. In practice, the radar will be dynamically adjusting its thresholds in response to a spatially and temporally varying environment. This will lead to a dynamic variation in detection and false alarm rate that cannot be simply described by traditional methods. This paper describes some of the problems with standard performance measures which are used for radar and proposes a number of further measures which should be considered to fully characterise a radar, especially under dynamically changing conditions.","uniformly distributed clutter,operational radar,performance specification,search radar,airborne maritime surveillance radars,user's needs,performance measures,detection probability,steady state performance measures,thermal noise,detection range,dynamically changing conditions,false alarm rate,"

"sperm whale (physeter macrocephalus) acoustic ecology at ocean station papa in the gulf of alaska – part 1: detectability and seasonality","2019","Sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus produce loud, stereotypical click sequences and are an ideal species to be studied with passive acoustic techniques. To increase our limited knowledge of sperm whale occurrence patterns in remote and inaccessible locations of the North Pacific, we analyzed a five-year-long (June 2007–April 2012) acoustic data set recorded at Ocean Station PAPA (OSP; 50°N, 145°W) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Firstly, we assessed the sperm whale detection performance of the Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), and secondly, we investigated temporal patterns of sperm whale presence at OSP. The PAL proved highly efficient, with above 50% probability of detecting more than two sperm whales, a condition met for over 50% of the recordings. Results indicated that sperm whale clicks were recorded year-round, with a clear seasonal pattern. The number of detections during the summer months was approximately 70% higher compared to winter. An ambient noise analysis showed that differences in detection rates were likely not driven by seasonal changes in ambient noise levels. The average propagation range of sperm whale clicks ranged between 7 and 8 km between summer and winter, with slightly decreased detection distances observed in winter. Seasonal shifts in the intensity of the Alaska Current and the latitudinal oscillations of the North Pacific Transition Zone results in changes in water mixing, transport of nutrients and the concentration of prey such as squid, which likely drives sperm whale distribution.","Ocean Station PAPA,Sperm whale (),North Pacific Transition Zone,Passive Aquatic Listener,Gulf of Alaska,Passive Acoustic Monitoring,Seasonality,"

For the purpose of this classification, it is proposed to use clustering, the method developed within the framework of this study. The peculiarity of the method is to take into account the specifics of presenting data on the routes of vessel traffic in the information and telecommunication system of the marine security. This specificity is considered in the routing metric and features of the route clusters formation as well as their centers localization.

"classification of small boats in infrared images for maritime surveillance","2010","Autonomous round-the-clock observation of wide critical maritime areas can be a powerful support for border protection agencies to avoid criminal acts like illegal immigration, piracy or drug trafficking. These criminal acts are often accomplished by using small boats to decrease the probability of being uncovered. In this paper, we present an image exploitation approach to detect and classify maritime objects in infrared image sequences recorded from an autonomous platform. We focus on high robustness and generality with respect to variations of boat appearance, image quality, and environmental condition. A fusion of three different detection algorithms is performed to create reliable alarm hypotheses. In the following, a set of well-investigated features is extracted from the alarm hypotheses and evaluated using a two-stage-classification with support vector machines (SVMs) in order to distinguish between three object classes: clutter, irrelevant objects and suspicious boats. On the given image data we achieve a rate of 97% correct classifications.","infrared image sequences,suspicious boats,border protection,Support vector machines,radar clutter,illegal immigration,Feature extraction,drug trafficking,environmental condition,support vector machines,maritime surveillance,search radar,small boat classification,piracy,image quality,clutter,Histograms,Training,infrared imaging,image sequences,Boats,marine communication,Clutter,"
"experimental comparison of ad hoc methods for classification of maritime vessels based on real-life ais data","2018","Classification of Maritime Vessels is a recurrent task in maritime surveillance systems. Classification can be conducted by different methods, e.g., NaÃ¯ve Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Fuzzy Rule, or Neural Networks. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is cooperative system of VHF-radio data exchange. By broadcasting of navigational data and ships' information it supports maritime safety, surveillance, and information. Based on measured AIS datasets of five maritime hotspots, easily implementable standard classification (i.e. ad hoc) methods from Data Science are compared to each other. These are evaluated in terms of accuracy. This experimental evaluation is motivated by the following question: Tip to which degree properties and behavior, e.g., vessel's type, can be detected by using large quantities of ship's positional, motion, and dimensions' data as provided by AIS? Future applications might include detection of fraudulent self-declarations of types, e.g., during illegal fishing activities.","surveillance,maritime surveillances systems,Fuzzy Rule,Nearest Neighbor,maritime vessels,Neural networks,Data Science,experimental comparison,Decision Tree,Decision trees,Neural Network,ad hoc methods,real-life AIS data,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,AIS,Ions,pattern classification,NaÃ¯ve Bayes,Artificial intelligence,navigational data,maritime surveillance systems,Training,maritime hotspots,VHF radio propagation,KNIME Analytics Platform,VHF-radio data exchange,radio data systems,Surveillance,Classification,accuracy,Task analysis,performance evaluation,maritime safety,"

Challenging maritime scenarios have been chosen to assess the detectors' performance against features such as ambiguities, significant sea clutter, or irregular shorelines. The SAR images which form the test data are complemented with ground truth to define the reference detection configuration, which permits quantifying the probability of detection, the false alarm rate, and the accuracy of estimating ship dimensions. Although the results show that all the detectors perform well, there is no perfect detector, and a better detection system could be developed that combines the best elements from each of the single detectors.

"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems.

Facing with its multi-dimensional and high-noise characteristics, in this study, an anomaly detection method based on a varying-scale hypercube accelerated density based spatial clustering for applications with noise (VHCA-DBSCAN) is proposed. An HCA-DBSCAN model based on the Gaussian probability density estimation is firstly established, in which the searching radius is adaptively calculated to identify the suspected outliers efficiently. Then, a traversal search strategy for hypercube segmentation is designed, where the lengths of the edges are varying according to the characteristics of each dimension. Finally, a modified local outlier factor (LOF) by using the approximate upper boundary is presented to evaluate the degree of the suspected outliers, and the confirmed ones are identified by collaboratively considering the manufacturing signals. Validation experiments by employing real-world data from a typical steel enterprise are carried out, and the results indicate that the proposed method exhibits reliable performance and high efficiency when facing with the anomaly detection problem of multi-dimensional industrial data.","Anomaly detection,Varying-scale HCA-DBSCAN,Multi-dimensional energy data,Steel industry,"

"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos. The experimental results show that our proposed framework successfully tracks ships in maritime video clips with high accuracy (i.e., the average root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are less than 10), which significantly outperforms the other popular ship trackers.","Smart ship,maritime surveillance videos,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,maritime traffic flow analysis,augmented ship tracking,ship trajectory dataset,on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information,visual ship features,Videos,kernelized correlation filter,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,maritime images,Correlation,curve fitting algorithm,image filtering,video signal processing,Training,curve fitting,ship occlusion videos,data anomaly detection,Visualization,traffic control,ship occlusion,traffic engineering computing,ship safety enhancement,video surveillance,visual ship tracking,"

"vessel detection and classification from spaceborne optical images: a literature survey","2018","This paper provides an overview of existing literature on vessel/ship detection and classification from optical satellite imagery. Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.","Ship detection,Sea target detection,Ship classification,Maritime domain awareness,Object recognition,Vessel classification,Optical satellite data,Vessel detection,"

However, collecting sufficient energy have become a significant issue, limiting the lifespan of such self-powered sensors. A new generation of self-powered sensors bridges the gap between the energy acquired and the energy needed for sensing, computing, storage, and transmission. This article provides an overview of the recent progress of TENG applications, followed by the discussion of potential research areas and future plans for self-powered sensors in the field of transportation engineering (covering motorized and non-motorized systems and condition assessment).

"a compact drone based multisensory system for maritime observation","2022","Sea pollution is growing rapidly and is responsible for environmental hazard for the marine fauna and human health.

Remote sensing technology (e.g. aerial, space and maritime technology) represents a powerful means to cope with this issue. It is a valid alternative to in situ measurements that can reduce costs and risks compared to in situ missions. Among all possible aerial platforms, drones offer a great flexibility and the technological advances in this field is making drones even more appealing for this kind of applications and research progresses rapidly.

An application of the system to mitigate a disruption in a maritime segment of a supply chain is studied. Solutions are composed of combinations of actions to reduce the consequences of a disruption.

"robust infrared maritime target detection via anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency","2022","When detecting diverse infrared (IR) small maritime targets on complicated scenes, the existing methods get into trouble and unsatisfactory performance. The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatialâ€“temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatialâ€“temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets. Experiments conducted on various real IR maritime image sequences demonstrate the applicability and robustness of ASTTC, which performs more satisfactorily than the existing methods in detection accuracy.","target characteristics,Pipelines,Optical imaging,ALGV descriptor,temporal correlation,robust spatial-temporal trajectory descriptor,image motion analysis,Feature extraction,gradient magnitude distribution,small-target detection,STTD,anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC),Adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV),Shi-Tomasi,robust infrared maritime target detection,multiframe decision,single-frame detection,robust anti-jitter spatial-temporal trajectory consistency,Target tracking,object detection,feature extraction,target encoding,IR imager motion,local dissimilarity measure,IR maritime image sequences,interframe registration capture,image registration,correlation methods,gradient methods,ASTTC,infrared imaging,Trajectory,image sequences,target trajectory consistency measurement,spatial information,Object detection,Adaptive optics,image capture,adaptive local gradient variation descriptor,"
"seaâ€“land segmentation in maritime surveillance radars via k-nearest neighbor classifier","2020","Shipborne or airborne maritime surveillance radars at scan mode work at a complex scene consisting of land, sea, and islands. Sea-land segmentation provides a two-class classification of sea clutter versus ground clutter to the surveillance scene as a precondition of adaptive target detection. It is a difficult problem because only a few coherent pulses are available at scan mode. Moreover, due to moving radar platforms and wide dynamic range of ground and sea clutter in power, average amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase of radar, the returns vector fails to distinguish sea clutter and ground clutter. In this article, a similarity measure of two radar returns vectors, which is invariant to amplitude, Doppler offset, and initial phase, is constructed, which is closely relevant to the Doppler bandwidth of a returns vector. Based on the similarity measure, a K-nearest neighbor classifier is proposed to yield a pixel-level sea-land segmentation of the scene. Further, the morphological filtering is operated on the pixel-level segmentation to obtain a region-level segmentation.

"atmospheric measurements of peroxyacetylnitrate (pan) in rural, south-east england: seasonal variations winter photochemistry and long-range transport","1984","Peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) is an important secondary pollutant formed in the ambient atmosphere during photochemical episodes; it constitutes a significant component of the atmospheric NOx cycle. The behaviour of PAN in the atmosphere has been studied at Harwell, a rural site in south-east England, using a sensitive technique with a detection limit of < 30 ppt(v). Even during winter months, daytime levels of PAN above the detection limit were always present, demonstrating the ubiquity of this molecule in the atmosphere. Results for the periods November 1974–October 1975 and January 1980–June 1981 show the existence of a pronounced seasonal variation. Maximum levels were observed during summer months, and minimum values during winter. There is a large difference between these maxima and minima, in contrast to typical patterns for ozone, and it is suggested that PAN is a better indicator of overall chemical reactivity in the lower atmosphere. Simultaneous measurement of CFCl3, was found to be a good indicator of air mass quality and anthropogenic influence; increased levels of this tracer were always associated with elevated PAN concentrations. Unexpectedly high levels of PAN during two episodes in February 1981 showed the possibility of significant photochemical activity during winter months. Back-trajectory analysis for these periods, indicated the influence of mainland European emissions and subsequent transport of photochemically-aged air masses.

"footprints of fishing vessels in chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","2022","The importance and difficulty of large-scale quantitative analysis of fishing vessel footprints and fishing intensities with high resolution have received more and more attention and recognition in fishery research. In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated. It is found that the footprints of fishing vessels in China's EEZ waters have a positive spatial correlation, and the areas with high fishing intensities are clustered in the coastal waters of Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The research results can be used for fishing area identification, fishery policy making, and sustainable fisheries development.","Quantitative analysis,Spatio-temporal analysis,Fisheries management,Chinese fishery,Fishing activity,Trajectory analysis,"

"analysis of the convective activity and its synoptic background over croatia","2012","In this study, deep convective activity, identified by lightning measurements and associated favorable synoptic conditions, is analyzed. The focus was on the warm part of the year (April to October) during the period 2006–2009 over six sub-regions in Croatia. A convectively active day is defined as a day with at least ten lightning strikes over the target sub-region. The obtained dataset is used to determine the climatology of the frequency and regional distribution of convective days and their inter-month variability. The analysis shows that 56% of all examined days, i.e., every second day during the warm part of the year, are days with convective activity. The most convectively active sub-region is the North Adriatic, with 62.4% of all days in the analyzed sample. The areas eastward of 16°E exhibit a peak in convective activity in June, contrary to the more western sub-regions, which show a maximum later in the summer, from July to August. The average temporal characteristics, such as typical duration, onset and cessation of convection, are also estimated. In all sub-regions, the convective activity begins in the early afternoon and ends mostly in the evening. Nocturnal convection occurs more frequently along the Adriatic coast. In the second part of this study, the dominant large-scale weather types and upper-level flow regimes, corresponding to the convectively active days, were determined using surface and upper-levels pressure fields. The lightning flashes are frequently detected in the non-gradient pressure field (23%); in the center (18%), in the leading (15%) and in the rear (12%) parts of the cyclone; and in the front part of a trough (11%). The southwesterly upper-level flow represents the most common flow regime (38%) in the days with convective activity. Slightly less is the northeasterly flow, which occurs with a frequency of approximately 23%, and the northwesterly flow, with a frequency of 18% of all selected days.","Weather types,Convection,Lightning,Upper-level flow regimes,"

"detection of signals linked to climate change, land-cover change and climate oscillators in tropical montane cloud forests","2021","Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) form biodiverse communities that are characterized by frequent occurrence of low-level clouds from which they capture a substantial proportion of their precipitation — here referred to as occult precipitation. TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 106 km2 ± 0.5 × 106 km2). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.","IOD,ENSO,TRMM,Tropical Montane Cloud Forests,Reanalysis,MODIS,Climate change,Cloud-base height,"
"variability of multivariate wave climate in latin america and the caribbean","2013","Wave climate is highly variable on the world's coast and its temporal changes and extremes usually imply consequences like erosion or impacts to infrastructures. Alterations in wave climate were little addressed in the four IPCC reports although variations in wave climate may cause extensive coastal impacts. Changes are also often related to climate pattern variability. This variability as well as long-term trends has been an issue of research in recent years. In the region of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) an understanding of wave climate and its variability is scant. In this paper we use an extensively calibrated and validated wave reanalysis to describe the wave climatology in the region at different time scales and for scalar and directional wave parameters. Long-term changes are identified in the wave heights and mean direction of the energy flux shows high spatial variability. Correlation patterns of the mean significant wave height and direction of mean energy flux lead to the detection of prominent modes of influence of several climate indices. A wave climate type approach is also used to identify wave variability along the region that allows an identification of different wave climate types in terms of wave parameters and occurrence frequency. In line with the results, the influence of El Niño events shows a higher frequency of occurrence of certain sea-states with respect to non ENSO years. We also explore how climate change affecting storm patterns may be translated into a modification of sea-state occurrence and therefore implying different consequences for coastal zones depending on local wave propagation.","Ocean waves,Inter-annual variability,Long-term trends,Wave direction,Seasonality,"

"improving maritime traffic emission estimations on missing data with crbms","2020","Maritime traffic emissions are a major concern to governments as they heavily impact the Air Quality in coastal cities. Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was able to detect 45% of additional emissions, representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new features that may enhance emission modeling.","CRBM,Data cleaning,Emission modeling,AIS,GPS,Ship time series,"

"footprint and detectability of a well leaking co2 in the central north sea: implications from a field experiment and numerical modelling","2019","Existing wells pose a risk for the loss of carbon dioxide (CO2) from storage sites, which might compromise the suitability of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as climate change mitigation options. Here, we show results of a controlled CO2 release experiment at the Sleipner CO2 storage site and numerical simulations that evaluate the detectability and environmental consequences of a well leaking CO2 into the Central North Sea (CNS). Our field measurements and numerical results demonstrate that the detectability and impact of a leakage of <55 t yr−1 of CO2 would be limited to bottom waters and a small area around the leak, due to rapid CO2 bubble dissolution in seawater within the lower 2 m of the water column and quick dispersion of the dissolved CO2 plume by strong tidal currents. As such, the consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are found to be insignificant in terms of storage performance. Only prolonged leakage along numerous wells might compromise long-term CO2 storage and may adversely affect the local marine ecosystem. Since many abandoned wells leak natural gas into the marine environment, hydrocarbon provinces with a high density of wells may not always be the most suitable areas for CO2 storage.","North Sea,Carbon dioxide,Leakage,Wells,Geological storage,Sleipner,"

"the role of the stratosphere in iberian peninsula rainfall: a preliminary approach in february","2007","This paper attempts to establish a connection between stratospheric anomalies in the North Pole and rainfall on the Iberian Peninsula through the occurrence of major midwinter warmings (MMWs) and cold events (CEs), taking February as a preliminary approach. We define the MMWs as the warmings which break down the polar vortex, whereas the CEs are the episodes in which the polar vortex remains cold and undisturbed. Both anomalies lead to a wind anomaly around the north polar stratosphere, which is connected with a shortly lagged tropospheric anomaly through a stratosphere–troposphere coupling in winter. A T-mode principal component analysis (PCA) was used as an objective pattern classification method for identifying the main daily surface-level pressure (SLP) patterns for February for the 1961–1990 reference period. Subsequently, those February months with an MMW or a CE influence in the troposphere are identified in the whole study period (1958–2000) by means of the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI). Thus, performing the same analysis for the selected February months, new principal patterns for detecting changes in surface circulation structure and morphology are obtained. The results show a significant decrease in the westerlies and a southward shift of the storm tracks in Western Europe some weeks after an MMW occurrence, leading to an increase in precipitation in western Iberia and a slight decrease on the eastern Mediterranean fringe. The results are quite the opposite under a CE influence: the westerlies are strengthened and shifted northwards due to the displacement of the Atlantic anticyclone towards Central Europe; dry conditions are established throughout Iberia, except for the Mediterranean fringe, where precipitation shows a considerable increase due to the greater frequency of the northeasterly winds. Finally, an 11-year sunspot cycle–quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modulation might be demonstrated in Iberian rainfall in February through the occurrence of these stratospheric anomalies.","Arctic Oscillation Index,Principal component analysis,Stratosphere–troposphere coupling,Circulation patterns,Major midwinter warming,Iberian rainfall,"

"structural health monitoring of harbor caissons using support vector machine and principal component analysis","2021","Harbor caissons are regarded as one of the most critical infrastructures, and any disruption in their operation would have dramatic economic consequences. The need for a health monitoring system for these structures is thus evident. The primary aim of this study is to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to effectively detect damage in harbor caissons. To this end, through performing dynamic analysis, acceleration signals are extracted from the locations in the model corresponding to the presumed accelerometer's placement in an actual structure. Three levels of white Gaussian noises are added to the original signal to simulate the ambient noise. Using the acquired signals, the damage-sensitive features in both frequency and time domains are determined in the structure. In this study, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the damage-sensitive features associated with the damaged and undamaged structure are reduced in dimensionality and classified. Hence, the introduced system can assess the state of the structure based on the input signal from the accelerometer and detect possible damage and its severity. The effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting damage is shown using the numerical model of a real harbor caisson.","Support vector machine (SVM),Principal component analysis (PCA),Finite element (FE) modeling,Structural health monitoring,Autoregressive (AR) model,Machine learning,Harbor caissons,"
"k-means clustering algorithms: a comprehensive review, variants analysis, and advances in the era of big data","2023","Advances in recent techniques for scientific data collection in the era of big data allow for the systematic accumulation of large quantities of data at various data-capturing sites. Similarly, exponential growth in the development of different data analysis approaches has been reported in the literature, amongst which the K-means algorithm remains the most popular and straightforward clustering algorithm. The broad applicability of the algorithm in many clustering application areas can be attributed to its implementation simplicity and low computational complexity. However, the K-means algorithm has many challenges that negatively affect its clustering performance. In the algorithm’s initialization process, users must specify the number of clusters in a given dataset apriori while the initial cluster centers are randomly selected. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is susceptible to the selection of this initial cluster and for large datasets, determining the optimal number of clusters to start with becomes complex and is a very challenging task. Moreover, the random selection of the initial cluster centers sometimes results in minimal local convergence due to its greedy nature. A further limitation is that certain data object features are used in determining their similarity by using the Euclidean distance metric as a similarity measure, but this limits the algorithm’s robustness in detecting other cluster shapes and poses a great challenge in detecting overlapping clusters. Many research efforts have been conducted and reported in literature with regard to improving the K-means algorithm’s performance and robustness. The current work presents an overview and taxonomy of the K-means clustering algorithm and its variants. The history of the K-means, current trends, open issues and challenges, and recommended future research perspectives are also discussed.","Clustering algorithm,Modified k-means,Perspectives on big data clustering,Improved k-means,Big data clustering,K-means,K-means variants,"
"pitting corrosion identification approach based on inverse finite element method for marine structure applications","2023","This paper presents a state-of-the art inverse finite element method (iFEM) for full-field, real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) of corroding structures. The study focuses on detecting the location and identifying the extent of pitting corrosion, which is one of the most hazardous forms of corrosion due to the difficulties regarding its prediction and detection. For this purpose, high-fidelity finite element (FE) models of corroded samples with complex-shaped, semi-ellipsoidal, and cylindroconical defects are developed to replicate the strain field of pitting corroded structures. The strain fields produced by the FE models, verified against experimental data, are reconstructed by the iFEM model using a robust and practical four-node quadrilateral inverse-shell element, iQS4. A strain-based damage criterion is defined to obtain the damage distribution and the location of corrosion pits on dog-bone tensile test samples with full sensor iFEM and coupled iFEM-GA reduced sensor technique. Finally, in a practical example of a structure with complex geometry, the proposed method's performance is assessed through detecting the location of corrosion damage on a cylindrical marine structure with axial stiffeners.","Structural health monitoring,Marine structures,Corrosion damage detection,Inverse finite element,"

To deal with above issues, in this paper a fast and robust moving object segmentation method on a water surface for maritime surveillance using dynamic background modeling and shadow suppression (OSDBMSS) in the complex wavelet domain is proposed. For dynamic background modeling, we have used frame difference, background registration, background difference and background difference mask in the complex wavelet domain. For shadow detection and removal, we exploit the high frequency subband in the complex wavelet domain. A comparative analysis of the proposed method is presented both qualitatively and quantitatively with other standard methods available in the literature for publicly available datasets of videos in different maritime scenarios, with varying light and weather conditions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is performing better in comparison to other standard methods for all the test cases.","moving object segmentation,change and shadow detection,complex wavelet domain,dynamic background modeling,maritime video surveillance,"
"an automated treatment plan alert system to safeguard cancer treatments in radiation therapy","2022","In radiation oncology, the intricate process of delivering radiation to a patient is detailed by the patient’s treatment plan, which is data describing the geometry, construction and strength of the radiation machine and the radiation beam it emits. The patient’s life depends upon the accuracy of the treatment plan, which is left in the hands of the vendor-specific software automatically generating the plan after an initial patient consultation and planning with a medical professional. However, corrupted and erroneous treatment plan data have previously resulted in severe patient harm when errors go undetected and radiation proceeds. The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic error-checking system to prevent the accidental delivery of radiation treatment to an area of the human body (i.e., the treatment site) that differs from the plan’s documented intended site. To this end, we develop a method for structuring treatment plan data in order to feed machine-learning (ML) classifiers and predict a plan’s treatment site. In practice, a warning may be raised if the prediction disagrees with the documented intended site. The contribution of this paper is in the strategic structuring of the complex, intricate, and nonuniform data of modern treatment planning and from multiple vendors in order to easily train ML algorithms. A three-step process utilizing up- and down-sampling and dimension reduction, the method we develop in this paper reduces the thousands of parameters comprising a single treatment plan to a single two-dimensional heat map that is independent of the specific vendor or construction of the machine used for treatment. Our heat-map structure lends itself well to feed well-established ML algorithms, and we train–test random forest, softmax, k-nearest neighbors, shallow neural network, and support vector machine using real clinical treatment plans from several hospitals in the United States. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method characterizes treatment sites so well that ML classifiers may predict head-neck, breast, and prostate treatment sites with an accuracy of about 94%. The proposed method is the first step towards a thorough, fully automated error-checking system in radiation therapy.","Radiation heat map,Nonuniform treatment data,Cancer classification,"
"anomaly detection with unknown anomalies: application to maritime machinery","2021","We present a framework for deriving anomaly detection algorithms on timeseries data when the time and expression of anomalous behaviour is unknown. The framework is suited for problems in which individual machine learning paradigms cannot be directly implemented: supervised learning is not applicable due to the lack of labelled data, unsupervised learning is not effective since the normal operations are insufficiently defined and take complex and diverse forms, and deep learning risks confusing problematic behaviours for expected ones due to the possible repetitiveness of similar anomalies. The proposed approach is comprised of two phases: unsupervised discovery of anomalies, and semi-supervised construction and tuning of the anomaly detection algorithm. By leveraging data exploration methods and expert knowledge, the resulting algorithms are interpretable and detect a wide range of anomalous behaviours. The approach is applied to the early detection of wear and tear of maritime propulsion and manoeuvring machinery. We show that the final algorithm is able to detect different types of anomalies, including an actual internal leakage in a thruster which is otherwise overlooked by the present rule-based alarm system.","diagnosis,predictive maintenance,condition-based monitoring,machine learning,anomaly detection,grey-box modelling,fault detection,"
"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"
"attacks detection and security control for cyber-physical systems under false data injection attacks","2023","This paper is concerned with the attack detection and security control problem for discrete-time nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPSs) under false data injection (FDI) attacks, which can bypass the traditional error detection mechanism. With the help of the T–S fuzzy models, a novel robust extended state observer with H∞ performance is proposed to estimate this kind of attack. The attacks are included inside the observer as an internal state variable and the estimation of the FDI attack can be obtained from the outputs of the observer. By utilizing the observation of the FDI attack, a compensator is designed to negate the attack. Additionally, a controller is proposed to bring on the attack ineffective. Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed schemes.",""
"an integrated maritime surveillance system based on high-frequency surface-wave radars. 2. operational status and system performance","2001","For pt.1 see ibid., vol.43, no.4, p.28-43 (2001). An integrated maritime surveillance (IMS) system, based on high-frequency surface wave radars (HFSWR), for monitoring surface and low-level air activity within the 200 nautical mile (nm) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is described in this two-part paper. The science behind the long-range performance of HFSWR was presented in Part 1(Sevgi et al. 2001). The system described was installed on Canada's east coast, where it is being used to demonstrate continuous, all-weather surveillance of the EEZ to beyond 200 nm. The system consists of two land-based HFSWRs and an operations control center (OCC). The two unmanned radars provide coverage of the Grand Banks region of Newfoundland, renowned for its offshore resources, particularly fish and oil. The system has been designed to assist authorities to more efficiently monitor such illegal activities as drug trafficking, smuggling, piracy, illicit fishing and illegal immigration. In addition, the system may be used for tracking icebergs, environmental protection, search and rescue, resource protection, sovereignty monitoring, and remote sensing of ocean surface currents and winds. Extensive performance testing of the system has been conducted using the two fully functional radars. It is shown that the HFSWR system complements existing surveillance assets to dramatically increase the effectiveness of air and surface reconnaissance missions by vectoring them directly to targets of interest.","unmanned radars,operations control center,marine radar,remote sensing,operational status,IMS system,long-range performance,radar detection,illegal immigration,Surface waves,Canada,sovereignty monitoring,illicit fishing,Environmental economics,drug trafficking,Petroleum,surface air activity,Exclusive Economic Zone,Grand Banks region,reconnaissance missions,Atlantic Ocean,illegal activities,tracking,icebergs,environmental protection,Remote monitoring,continuous all-weather surveillance,high-frequency surface-wave radars,integrated maritime surveillance system,Sea surface,search radar,low-level air activity,EEZ,piracy,Protection,Radar,system performance,winds,smuggling,radar tracking,Newfoundland,search and rescue,ocean surface currents,Doppler radar,3 to 6 MHz,OCC,Control systems,resource protection,Surveillance,HFSWR,remote sensing by radar,Marine animals,"
"regional climate model simulations of extreme air temperature in greece. abnormal or common records in the future climate?","2015","The aim of this study is to analyze and quantify the future projections of heat waves in Greece. For this reason, specific climatic indices were used in the analysis concerning absolute, percentile and duration indices defined by the CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team (ET) on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The future projections (SRES A1B) of these indices such as summer days, tropical days, maximum daily maximum air temperature, warm days, tropical nights, maximum daily minimum air temperature, warm nights and warm spell duration were carried out using six regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project, concerning the near future 2031–2050 and the far future 2071–2100 compared to the reference period 1961–1990. The ensemble means along with the inter-model-standard deviations of the examined extreme indices for the future model projections are presented and analyzed. Further, the findings of this analysis are discussed against recent recorded heat waves during 2007, in order to understand if such events are even more extreme or common in the future climate. It is very likely, that the anomalies observed in 2007, especially for extreme indices of minimum air temperature, could be more frequent considered as typical events by the end of the 21th century.","Heat waves,ENSEMBLES project,Greece,Regional climate models (RCMs),Extreme air temperature indices,"
"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem. Closed analytical forms are provided for the detection and false alarm probabilities of the hypothesis test.","real-world data,AIS contacts,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection problem,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,statistical hypothesis testing,target tracking,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,statistical testing,radar,long term prediction of vessel motion,standard maritime routes,Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Maritime surveillance,statistical hypothesis test,Trajectory,probability,anomalous deviation detection,Transponders,marine communication,anomaly detection procedure,Spaceborne radar,"
"wald- and rao-based detection for maritime radar targets in sea clutter with lognormal texture","2022","Non-Gaussian sea clutter causes conventional detectors designed in Gaussian clutter to suffer detection performance degradation, and some nuisance parameters cause the uniformly most powerful test to be unavailable. To improve the detection performance of maritime radar targets, we investigate the design of adaptive detectors in correlated non-Gaussian sea clutter by using suboptimal tests. The non-Gaussian sea clutter is modeled as a product of lognormal-distributed texture and complex Gaussian speckle. Two adaptive radar target detectors are developed by using the suboptimal two-step Wald and Rao tests. Specifically, a nonadaptive detector is derived by the Wald or Rao test when the clutter texture and speckle covariance matrix are assumed to be known in the first step; then the clutter parameters known in the first step are estimated, and the true parameters of the detector obtained in the first step are replaced with the estimated values. Theoretical proof and experimental verification indicate that the two proposed detectors have the constant false alarm property with regard to the clutter speckle covariance matrix and the clutter average power. Numerical results on simulated and measured radar data show that the proposed Rao-based detector outperforms its competitors and has stronger robustness to the signal mismatch compared to the proposed Wald-based detector.","Wald-based detector,covariance matrices,speckle,marine radar,detection performance degradation,complex Gaussian speckle,Wald test,radar detection,Lognormal texture,radar clutter,clutter texture,Gaussian clutter,adaptive radar,clutter speckle covariance matrix,sea clutter,adaptive detectors,radar targets,Covariance matrices,object detection,adaptive radar target detectors,Rao-based detector,maritime radar targets,Radar clutter,Radar,radar signal processing,clutter average power,Gaussian noise,Clutter,clutter parameters,nonGaussian sea clutter,Rao-based detection,Rao test,Gaussian distribution,Radar detection,Detectors,NonGaussian sea clutter,Speckle,"
"an application of hierarchical gaussian processes to the detection of anomalies in star light curves","2019","This study is concerned with astronomical time-series called light-curves that represent the brightness of celestial objects over a period of time. We consider the task of finding anomalous light-curves of periodic variable stars. We employ a Hierarchical Gaussian Process to create a general and stable model of time-series for anomaly detection, and apply this approach to the light-curve problem. Hierarchical Gaussian Processes require only a few additional parameters compared to conventional Gaussian Processes and incur negligible additional computational complexity. Moreover, since the additional parameters are objectively optimised in a principled probabilistic framework one does not need to resort to grid searches for parameter selection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several baselines on both synthetic and light-curve data. Of particular interest is that the proposed method generalises very well from small subsets of the data, achieving near perfect precision of outlier detection even with as few as seven instances.","Anomaly detection,Astronomical data,Gaussian processes,"
"olive groves around the lake. a ten-thousand-year history of a cretan landscape (greece) reveals the dominant role of humans in making this mediterranean ecosystem","2021","The reconstruction of millennial-scale interactions between ecosystems and societies can provide unique and valuable references for understanding the creation of cultural landscapes and help elucidate their value, weaknesses and legacies. Among the most emblematic forms of Mediterranean land use, olive groves and pastoralism have occupied a prominent place. Therefore, it is vital to know when, how, and with what ecological consequences these practices were established and developed. Located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea, Crete is the largest island of Greece. The island is characterised by a long human history of land use, but our understanding of past environmental changes for the entire Holocene is fragmentary. This paper presents a new investigation of Lake Kournas in Crete, where recent coring provided a 15-m sequence covering ten millennia of land cover and land-use history. The study of this new core involves the analysis of the sediment dynamics, flood deposits, pollen, diatoms, fungal and algal remains, and microcharcoals. Results show that ecosystem development near Lake Kournas was not a linear process. They reveal linkages and feedbacks between vegetation, biodiversity, fire, human impact, erosion, and climate change. A possible human occupation and agro-pastoral activities around the lake may have been detected as early as 9500 cal BP, perhaps in a transitional phase between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. At 8500 cal BP, climatic conditions may have promoted the expansion of the evergreen oak woodland. However, human impact was probably the most important driver of ecosystem change with the establishment of an agro-system after 8000 years ago. Thereafter, the trajectory of Kournas’ lake and catchment ecosystems from the Mid to Late Holocene follow the rhythm of land-use change. Among the traditional Mediterranean land uses, olive cultivation locally played a major role in the socio-ecosystem interactions, providing economic benefits but also destabilising soils. During the last six millennia, three main phases of olive cultivation occurred during the Final Neolithic-Minoan period, the Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine (HRB) period and Modern times. Along with the changing land use under the successive political and economic influences rules, the resilience capacities of vegetation permitted it to shift back to higher biodiversity again after decreasing phases. Forest vegetation was always able to recover until the onset of the Venetian period (13th century), when woodlands were dramatically reduced. Only during the past century has forest vegetation slightly recovered, while the flood regime had already been altered during previous centuries. During the past 100 years, biodiversity markedly declined, probably in response to the industrialization of agriculture.","Olive grove,Land-use,Crete,Mediterranean,Paleoecology,Anthropisation,Human impacts,Holocene,Socio-ecosystem,Biodiversity,"

Furthermore the maintenance engineers despite doing their best, only apply hot-fixes to the systems when they’re serviced. This work addresses the idea of detecting errors on the refrigeration system, by using all available sensory input. The data is then applied to construct an estimator of the sample-distribution, which in turn can be used to determine if a sample can be classified as a failure or not. The approach builds on that of Lasserre and Pauwels (2016), but the extension out-performs the original, across all log-files the system is tested on. In conclusion, the method derived throughout this paper, is indeed viable for fault detection on refrigeration containers.","Data Processing,Data Streams,Fault Detection,Polynomials,Polynomial Methods,"

"safeway: improving the safety of autonomous waypoint detection in maritime using transformer and interpolation","2023","Detecting waypoints where vessels change their behavior (i.e., maneuvers, speed changes, etc.) is essential for optimizing vessel trajectories to increase the efficiency and safety of sailing. However, accurately detecting waypoints is challenging due to potential AIS data quality issues (i.e., missing or inaccurate messages). In this paper, we propose a five-step learning approach (SafeWay) to estimate waypoints on a given AIS trajectory. First, we interpolate trajectories to tackle AIS data quality issues. Then, we annotate historical trajectories by using an existing waypoint library that contains historical waypoints. As the historical waypoints are passage plans manually created by port operators considering sailing conditions at that time, they are not specific to other historical trajectories between the same ports. We, therefore, use a similarity metric to determine overlapping segments of historical trajectories with the historical waypoints from the waypoint library. Then, we build a transformer model to capture vessel movement patterns based on speed- and location-related features. We do not process location features directly to avoid learning location-specific context, but take into account tailored delta features. We test our approach on a real-world AIS dataset collected from the Norwegian Sea between Å lesund and Måløy and show its effectiveness in terms of a harmonic mean of purity and coverage, mean absolute error and detection rate on the task of detecting trajectory waypoints compared to a state-of-the-art approach. We also show the effectiveness of the trained model on the trajectories obtained from two other regions, the North Sea (London and Rotterdam) and the North Atlantic Ocean (Setubal and Gibraltar), on which the model has not been trained. The experiments indicate that our interpolation-enabled transformer design provides improvements in the safety of the estimated waypoints.","Transformers,Maritime,Interpolation,Safety,Trajectory prediction,Vessel,Maneuver,Waypoint detection,Automatic identification system,AIS,"
"a stap detection scheme for low sample support maritime environments","2023","In airborne radar, reduced rank space-time adaptive processing techniques are employed when non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of the clutter causes insufficient sample support. There have been many approaches proposed to address this problem, including principal components, the cross-spectral metric and the multistage Wiener filter. This latter approach is superior to other reduced rank techniques in terms of computational efficiency, sample support and rank requirements. Regarding operation in heterogeneous environments, the single data set approach for clutter suppression has been proposed and operates solely on the cell under test to obtain a clutter covariance estimate. It is therefore highly effective in environments with limited training data that is homogeneous with the test data. In this paper, a single data set detection approach under the framework of the multistage Wiener filter is proposed and analysed to enhance clutter suppression capabilities. The target detection performance of the filter is evaluated using simulated maritime radar data.","Training data,Training,space time adaptive processing,Clutter,Covariance matrices,single data set,Estimation,Detectors,Radar detection,wiener filter,"
"on iot intrusion detection based on data augmentation for enhancing learning on unbalanced samples","2022","Internet of things (IoT) security is a prerequisite for the rapid development of the IoT to enhance human well-being. Machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) have good protection capabilities. However, it is difficult to identify attack information in massive amounts of data, which leads to inefficient model detection when faced with insufficient samples for certain types of attacks. In this regard, this paper fuses deep learning methods and statistical ideas to address the problem of minority samples attack detection, and proposes an intrusion detection method for the IoT based on Improved Conditional Variational Autoencoder (ICVAE) and Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (BSM), called ICVAE-BSM. By introducing an auxiliary network into the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to adjust the output probability distribution of the encoder, learning the posterior distribution of different classes of samples, so that the distributions of samples of the same class are concentrated, and the distributions of different classes of samples are scattered in the latent space; then based on BSM, adaptively synthesize the edge latent variables in the latent space of ICVAE, and feed the new synthetic edge latent variables to the ICVAE’s decoder to generate representative new samples to balance the data set. The output of the encoder is connected to the Softmax classifier at last, and the original samples are mixed with the generated samples to fine-tune it to enhance its generalization ability for intrusion detection of minority samples. We use the NSL-KDD data set, CIC-IDS2017 data set and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data set to simulate and evaluate the model, the experimental results show that the proposed method can more effectively improve the accuracy of IoT attack detection under the condition of unbalanced samples.","Data augmentation,Borderline-SMOTE,Conditional Variational Autoencoder,IoT intrusion detection,"
"vague labelling laws and outdated fish naming lists undermine seafood market transparency in canada","2021","Despite the expressed interest of Canadians in sustainable and comprehensively labelled seafood, the country’s seafood labelling requirements remain scant and naming conventions in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) ‘fish list’ allow the grouping of multiple species under single ‘umbrella’ terms. Here, we test the extent to which CFIA listings reflect current market availability and conceal biodiversity, using the flatfishes as a model. Accordingly, we compared CFIA-listed flatfish species with those documented in Canadian import records, those in production records of Canada and its flatfish suppliers, as well as those identified in DNA-based market surveys conducted across Canada. Of the 43 flatfish species on the CFIA list, only three have consistently shown up in Canadian imports, production records and market surveys, whereas almost a third (n = 15) failed to appear in any of the latter over at least a decade. Species have been detected on the market that are absent from this list, while overfished and/or threatened taxa have been found concealed under vague generic terms. The list’s many superfluous inclusions, outdated names, missing species and poor correspondence with trading partner’s naming conventions are inconsistent with the legal tenets of Canadian policy to uphold fair market practices and consumer choice, and instead result in a system inundated by numerous paths of misinterpretation, misclassification and substitution. Moreover, Canada’s official flatfish trade statistics lack sufficient taxonomic granularity to elucidate all species involved and track flatfish trade flows. Illuminating these loopholes should compel improvements in Canadian seafood labelling and traceability legislative frameworks.","DNA Barcoding,Pleuronectiformes,Trade,Flatfishes,Traceability,CFIA,"

"cognitive mimo sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","2009","Robust detection of various hostile threats is vital to protect Navy ships and other facilities within harbor and maritime environments. Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) sonar transmits single acoustic waveform by single projector, which has a few disadvantages including low target detection probability, low resolution, vulnerability of interception by the enemy, sensitivity to jamming, etc. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), typically applied to communications and radar solutions, is an emerging technology that can be applied to sonar to overcome many of the SISO sonar disadvantages. In this paper, cognitive monostatic/bistatic/multistatic MIMO sonar approaches are proposed. MIMO sonar transmits different orthogonal acoustic waveforms from multiple projectors with different spatial distributions. Through space-time-waveform diversity, MIMO sonar is able to apply coherent processing techniques over the received signals, and acquires more diversity gains.

"gross and microscopic pathology of lesions in pocillopora spp. from the subtropical eastern pacific","2014","Coral reefs are threatened by a variety of factors including diseases that have caused significant damage in some regions such as in the Caribbean. At present, no data are available on coral diseases in the Mexican Pacific where Pocillopora spp. is a dominant component of coral communities. Here, we describe gross and microscopic morphology of lesions found in pocilloporids at four sites in the Mexican Pacific. Corals were identified and their lesions photographed and quantified in the field. Tissue samples were collected from healthy and affected colonies for histopathology. We recorded seven species of pocilloporids at the study sites with Isla Isabel being the location with the highest coral diversity (H′=1.27). Lesions were present in 42% of the colonies and included discoloration (32%), predation-induced tissue loss (30%), unexplained tissue loss (3%) and overgrowth by sponges or algae (35%). The most affected species, P. damicornis (50%), was also one of the most common in the region. No species was more prone to a particular lesion, but there was a significant association between location and the presence of lesions. Northern Islas Marietas (61%) and Isla Isabel (41%) had the highest prevalence of lesions, followed by Manzanillo (37%) and Bahías de Huatulco (23%). Histological changes included atrophy of the surface body wall with depletion of zooxanthellae (91%) in corals with discoloration (bleaching). Ablation of tissue from mesoglea (18%) was also observed. Colonies with unexplained tissue loss showed atrophy and thinning of the epidermis (89%), characterized by cuboidal instead of pseudocolumnar cells normally found in healthy pseudocolumnar ciliated epithelium. Bacterial aggregates between the mesoglea and gastrodermis (11%) were very conspicuous in healthy and diseased corals. Lesions produced by fish bites and gastropods were associated with tissue atrophy (40%) and, in some cases, algal overgrowth near the lesion (20%). No infectious agents associated with cell pathology were detected microscopically. Bleaching and overgrowth by algae and sponges, as well as unexplained tissue loss, are common in Pocillopora. These lesions and anatomical changes warrant further study since their incidence is potentially indicative of reef degradation.","Histopathology,Eastern Pacific,Lesions,Coral diseases,"

"fusion detection algorithm of maritime radar and electro-optical pod for complex sea conditions","2023","In order to improve the perceptual capability of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) in complex sea conditions, a fusion detection algorithm has been developed that combines maritime radar and electro-optical (EO) pod. This algorithm integrates the positional state of the USV, class information of the maritime target obtained through a vision-based target detection algorithm, and processed maritime radar information. By using Gaussian and morphological filtering, the fusion of position state information from the USV, EO pod data, and maritime radar data is achieved. This effectively mitigates the negative impact of environmental factors, such as waves and water mist, on target detection. A cooperative sensing process between the maritime radar and EO pod is proposed to fuse the data obtained from both sources, resulting in accurate comprehensive target information.

"ship detection in maritime surveillance system based on yolox","2023","In this paper, we study the problem of ship target detection in maritime video surveillance systems, with special attention to the detection accuracy and adaptability under bad weather conditions. To this end, we propose an improved ship target detection method, including the addition of additive attention mechanism, and through testing on ship data sets, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further evaluate the performance of the method in severe weather conditions, we also used a flexible data enhancement strategy to generate a diverse synthetic test datasets, including different conditions such as rain, fog, and low illumination. Based on this datasets, we constructed a test datasets specifically for small vessel target detection, in which we evaluated the proposed approach. Experimental results show that compared with other mainstream competing algorithms such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOX, our method has superior performance in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. In addition, the proposed method proves its good adaptability in ship detection under harsh imaging conditions. Therefore, the improved method proposed in this paper is expected to provide higher accuracy and reliability for ship target detection in Marine video surveillance systems.","Streaming media,object detection,YOLOX,Rain,Object detection,Lighting,Safety,deep learning,Video surveillance,Marine vehicles,maritime video surveillance,"

"target visibility estimation in a buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar","2015","A buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system has been under recent experimental investigation for the detection of small, low speed, low radar cross section (low detectability) maritime targets. One of the main issues regarding target detectability in such a low grazing angle system is the actual visibility of the target due to blocking by waves, especially at higher sea states. Currently experimentation is limited mainly to the lower sea states, mostly using shore mounted antennas in littoral environments; in higher seas and indeed in deep seas with moving antennas, experimentation is more logistically challenging and so initial investigations are being performed through modelling. Thus this paper investigates target observability through consideration of line of sight for selected maritime scenarios and radar topologies for the buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system in deep sea conditions.","Antennas,maritime,marine radar,Surface waves,sea states,Power capacitors,littoral environments,observability,Wind speed,maritime forward scatter radar system,radar cross-sections,radar target recognition,maritime targets,Sea surface,Sea state,Radar,grazing angle system,deep sea conditions,radar cross section,visibility,target detectability,buoy mounted maritime forward scatter radar system,target visibility estimation,forward scatter radar,"
"fast and parameter-light rare behavior detection in maritime trajectories","2020","Rare behaviors indicate important events and situations in maritime surveillance applications. State-of-the-art methods provide many effective solutions to detect anomalous behaviors. Meanwhile, most solutions are parameter-laden and too costly to identify useful rare behaviors with human knowledge in a visual analytics manner. This paper is concerned with a scheme cross trajectories, vessel attributes and the movement context for detecting rare behaviors through preprocessing, kNN-based clustering, and verification. Although the scheme involves several parameters, we demonstrate that they are able to be tackled in thresholds. As a result, a rare behavior factor is the single parameter that affect the detecting results. The proposed scheme is evaluated via a simulated data set for performance and a real life AIS data for effectiveness. Results show that high accuracy to labelled anomalies and useful rare behaviors can be achieved.","Rare behaviour detection,Trajectory,Visual analytics,"
"an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach for object detection in maritime environments","2018","Robust real-time object detection and tracking are challenging problems in autonomous transportation systems due to operation of algorithms in inherently uncertain and dynamic environments and rapid movement of objects. Therefore, tracking and detection algorithms must cooperate with each other to achieve smooth tracking of detected objects that later can be used by the navigation system. In this paper, we first present an efficient multi-sensor fusion approach based on the probabilistic data association method in order to achieve accurate object detection and tracking results. The proposed approach fuses the detection results obtained independently from four main sensors: radar, LiDAR, RGB camera and infrared camera. It generates object region proposals based on the fused detection result. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used to identify the object categories within these regions. The CNN is trained on a real dataset from different ferry driving scenarios.

However, the information in camera-based data is limited. In this work, we propose a novel intelligent maritime surveillance framework driven by the fusion of camera-based vessel detection and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Firstly, we employ a vessel detection network to get the relative positions of the vessels from the calibrated camera-based data. Meanwhile, we design a series of filters based on data completeness, detection range, and vessel course to exclude the invalid AIS data. In the end, we propose a data fusion module based on estimating the time when the vessel arrive at the specific position. According to the experiment on our collected dataset, the proposed framework performs competitively in diversified scenes.

"mapping and quantifying sargassum distribution and coverage in the central west atlantic using modis observations","2016","Sargassum washing ashore on the beaches of the Caribbean Islands since 2011 has caused problems for the local environments, tourism, and economies. Although preliminary results of Sargassum distributions in the nearby oceans have been obtained using measurements from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), MERIS stopped functioning in 2012, and detecting and quantifying Sargassum distributions still face technical challenges due to ambiguous pixels from clouds, cloud shadows, cloud adjacency effect, and large-scale image gradient. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to detect Sargassum presence and to quantify Sargassum coverage using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) alternative floating algae index (AFAI), which examines the red-edge reflectance of floating vegetation. This approach includes three basic steps: 1) classification of Sargassum-containing pixels through correction of large-scale gradient, masking clouds and cloud shadows, and removal of ambiguous pixels; 2) linear unmixing of Sargassum-containing pixels; and, 3) statistics of Sargassum area coverage in pre-defined grids at monthly, seasonal, and annual intervals. In the absence of direct field measurements to validate the results, limited observations from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) measurements and numerous local reports support the conclusion that the elevated AFAI signals are due to the presence of Sargassum instead of other floating materials, and various sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the uncertainties in the derived Sargassum area coverage. The approach was applied to MODIS observations between 2000 and 2015 over the Central West Atlantic (CWA) region (0–22°N, 63–38°W) to derive the spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as the total area coverage of Sargassum. Results indicate that the first widespread Sargassum distribution event occurred in 2011, consistent with previous MERIS findings. Since 2011, only 2013 showed a minimal Sargassum coverage similar to the period of 2000 to 2010; all other years showed significantly more coverage. More alarmingly, the summer months of 2015 showed mean coverage of >2000km2, or about 4 times of the summer 2011 coverage and 20 times of the summer 2000 to 2010 coverage. Analysis of several environmental variables provided some hints on the reasons causing the inter-annual changes after 2010, yet further multi-disciplinary research (including in situ measurements) is required to understand such changes and long-term trends in Sargassum coverage.","FAI,Remote sensing,Surface fitting,Feature extraction,AFAI,MODIS,Cloud shadow,Cloud,"

"temperature and salinity trends in the northern limit of the canary current upwelling system","2023","Thermohaline time series are crucial for detecting and quantifying abiotic changes in the marine environment, and even more so in the present global change scenario. This is particularly relevant for the Ría the Vigo and its adjacent shelf, a highly productive ecosystem at the northern limit of the Canary Current Upwelling System (CanCUS). This study analyses a 34-year time series (1987–2020) of Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, the longest series available to date in the region. Long-term trends, shifts, and seasonal variability of temperature and salinity were assessed and investigated in relation to regional meteorological variability and basin-scale atmospheric teleconnection indices. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) allowed us to determine that monthly thermohaline variability can be largely explained by regional meteo-climatic variability, mainly upwelling index and river discharge. Trends and shifts in some teleconnection patterns, especially the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, may also be related to both the shift in salinity in 2013 and its long-term decrease below 50 m depth. Despite the current global warming context, no statistically significant trend was observed for either the upwelling index or temperature. The spatial analysis of sea surface temperature trends suggests that our study area has been responding to climate change differently from other surrounding near-shore areas, as the Finisterre Cape or the southern Bay of Biscay. Overall, this study highlights the importance of long-term observations to elucidate the impact of climate change in the northern limit of the CanCUS and encourages caution when extrapolating conclusions from ecosystem studies on a regional scale.",""
"spaceborne multichannel sar imaging algorithm for maritime moving targets","2023","Spaceborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective means to realize high-resolution and wide-swath imaging. However, for spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging of maritime moving targets, the target motion will cause undesired channel imbalance, i.e., phase error, and further introduce the spurious targets in the image. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging algorithm for maritime moving targets, which consists of sequential coarse imaging and accurate imaging. The key strategies are to separate different moving targets by coarse imaging and to estimate the phase error based on the relationship between phase errors and amplitudes of spurious targets. First, the quantitative relationship between phase errors and amplitudes of spurious targets is established. Second, based on coarse imaging results, different maritime targets are effectively separated. Then, based on the measured amplitudes of spurious targets, a cost function, which represents the difference between the real target velocity and estimated target velocity, is constructed and minimized to separately estimate the velocities and phase errors of targets. Moreover, to further improve the accuracy of estimation and to suppress the undesired effects caused by target defocusing, clutter, and noise, an iterative strategy is adopted. Finally, by autofocusing, a well-focused SAR image is obtained. The GF-3 dual-channel real data experiment is conducted. The results indicate that the spurious targets are well suppressed, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","estimation accuracy improvement,well-focused SAR image,undesired channel imbalance,spectrum reconstruction,radar detection,autofocusing,accurate imaging,real target velocity,Synthetic aperture radar,high-resolution imaging,moving target imaging,iterative strategy,spaceborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar,cost function,estimated target velocity,object detection,nonuniform sampling,synthetic aperture radar,spurious targets,radar imaging,velocity measurement,Radar polarimetry,sequential coarse imaging,Channel imbalance estimation,iterative methods,target defocusing,phase error estimation,Azimuth,target motion,GF-3 dual-channel real data experiment,spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging algorithm,spaceborne radar,Imaging,Signal to noise ratio,wide-swath imaging,parameter estimation,Estimation,multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Channel estimation,maritime moving targets,"
"the nitrate radical: physics, chemistry, and the atmosphere","1991","This review surveys the present state of knowledge of the nitrate (NO3 radical. Laboratory data on the physics and chemistry of the radical and atmospheric determination of the concentrations of the radical are both considered. One aim of the review is to highlight the relationship between the laboratory and the atmospheric studies. Although the emphasis of the review is on gas-phase processes, relevant studies conducted in condensed phases are mentioned because of their potential importance in the interpretation of cloud and aerosol chemistry. The spectroscopy, structure, and photochemistry of the radical are examined. Here, the object is to establich the spectroscopic basis for detection of the radical and measurement of its concentration in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Infrared, visible, and paramagnetic resonance spectra are considered. An important quantity discussed is the absorption cross section in the visible region, which is required for quantitative measurements. Interpretation of the spectroscopic features requires an understanding of the geometrical and electronic structure of the radical in its ground and excited states; there is still some controversy about the groundstate geometry, but the most recent experimental evidence 9eg from laser induced fluorescence) and theoretical calculations suggest that the radical has D3h symmetry. Photodissociation of the radical is important in the atmosphere, and the product channels, quantum yields, and dissociation dynamics are discussed. A short examination of the thermodynamics (heat and entropy of formation) of the radical is presented. The main exposition of laboratory studies of the chemistry of the nitrate radical is preceded by a consideration of the techniques used for kinetic and mechanistic studies. Methods for the generation and detection of the radical and the kinetic tools employed are all presented. The exact nature of the technique used in individual studies has some relevance to the way in which data must be analysed, and to the type of mechanistic information that can be extracted. Continuous and stopped flow, flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis, molecular modulation, and static reactor techniques can all provide absolute kinetic data, while relative rate measurements have been a further rich source of information. The treatment of the chemical reactions of the nitrate radical is formally divided into the interactions with non-radical inorganic (deemed to include NO and NO2) and organic species, and with atoms and free radicals. In general, the reactions with open-shell species are much more rapid than those with closed-shell reactants. With the closed-shell partners, addition reactions are faster than abstraction reactions. An attempt is made to consider critically the published data on most reactions of importance, and to tabulate rate constants and temperature dependences where possible. However, it is not the objective of this review to provide recommendations for rate parameters. Evidence for the products of the reactions is sought, and for the branching ratios into the various channels where more than one exists. One theme of this part of the review is the elucidation of correlations of reactivity with structure and with the reactions of other radical species such as OH. The review turns next to a consideration of the role of NO3 in the atmosphere, of its atmospheric sources and sinks, and of field measurements of concentrations of the radical. Long-path visible-absorption spectroscopy and matrix-isolation ESR have both been used successfully in field measurements in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere. Balloon-borne instruments and ground-based remote sensing have been used to obtain stratospheric concentrations. Two of the most important implications of the measurements are that the stratospheric profiles are consistent with accepted chemistry (and, in particular, do not require the postulation of an unidentified scavenging mechanism that had, at one stage, been proposed), and that the highly variable night-time tropospheric concentrations imply that NO3 is a reactive tropospheric constituent. The inter-relation between laboratory studies and atmospheric observations, and the problems in extrapolating laboratory data to atmospheric conditions, are both explored. Initiation of night-time chemical transformations by NO3 and the possible production of OH are considered. The available information is then brought together to see how far NO3 is a sensitive indicator of the state of the atmosphere, and some speculations are presented about the involvement of NO3 (or N2O5) in damage to trees and plants. The final section of the review suggests some issues that remain unresolved concerning the NO3 radical which is directly or indirectly relevant to a better knowledge of the part played by the radical in the atmosphere. Amongst the requirements noted are improved data for the heat of formation of the radical, its absorption cross section in the visible region (and, especially, the temperature dependence of the cross section), and the details of its photochemistry. There is also still a need for a definitive determination of the equilibrium constant and its temperature dependence for the association with NO2 and the reverse dissociation of N2O5. A series of chemical reactions deserves further investigation, especially with regard to elucidation of product channels, and overall oxidation mechanisms also need to be defined better. Future atmospheric studies that are desirable include study of basic NO3 chemistry in the field to understand the influence of humidity on the conversion (probably on surfaces) of N2O5 to HNO3, and thus on NO3 concentrations. In addition, a study of the chemistry of NO3 in the presence of volatile organic compounds and at elevated concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen should help in the understanding of, for example, polluted marine coasts, forests, and urban areas.",""
"improving volcanic ash cloud detection by a robust satellite technique","2004","Automated and reliable satellite-based techniques are strongly required for volcanic ash cloud detection and tracking. In fact, volcanic ash clouds pose a serious hazard for air traffic and the synoptic (and possibly frequent) coverage offered by satellites can provide exciting opportunities for monitoring activities as well as for risk mitigation purposes. A new, AVHRR-based technique for improved automatic detection of volcanic clouds by means of multi-temporal analysis of historical, long-term satellite records has been recently proposed. The technique basically rests on the Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT) approach, which is an innovative strategy of satellite data analysis, devoted to a former characterisation of the measured signal, in terms of expected value and natural variability and a further recognition of signal anomalies by an automatic, unsupervised change detection step. In this work, an extension of this method to nighttime observations is presented, by using thermal infrared information coming from AVHRR bands centred approximately at 3.5, 11.0 and 12.0 μm. Results achieved for two recent eruptive events of Mount Etna (occurred in May 2000 and in July 2001) seem to be encouraging, showing clear improvements in terms of ash detection sensitivity as well as in terms of false alarms reduction. The technique performance is also evaluated by comparison with the traditional “split-window” brightness temperature difference method; this exercise revealed a general improvement obtained by the proposed approach, even though some common problems still remain unsolved. The main merits of such an approach are its intrinsic self-adaptability to different environmental/natural/observational conditions and its natural exportability also to different satellite sensors. The results here presented show the benefits of such a technique especially when different observational conditions (time of pass, seasonal period, atmospheric moisture, solar illumination, volcanic cloud composition, satellite angles of view, etc.) are considered. The future prospects, also in terms of possible operational scenarios, coming from the implementation of such an approach on the new generation of satellite sensors (like, for example, SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation platform) are also discussed.","Volcanic monitoring from space,Mount Etna,Ash clouds detection/discrimination,Multi-temporal analyses,Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT),AVHRR,"

"automatic detection of rescue targets in maritime search and rescue missions using uavs","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be an important resource when performing Search and Rescue (SAR) operations at sea, as this technology is fairly inexpensive when compared to traditional SAR approaches that use significant human resources and expensive air and naval assets, thus enabling the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously in these missions to perform rescue targets search in maritime environments.In order to maximize the usefulness of these UAVs in such operations, we propose a method which utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection network to perform real-time rescue target detection on-board the UAV, using standard RGB cameras, with minimal human intervention, thus enabling an increased vehicle autonomy and search range. Additionally, since the UAVs only relay the candidate images and locations that contain possible rescue targets, given by the onboard detector, it is possible to have several UAVs working in parallel that report back to a single human operator.We have selected the YOLOv4-tiny detection network, pretrained in the COCO dataset, and retrained it to detect rescue targets at sea.

"learning for prediction of maritime collision avoidance behavior from ais network","2021","With the rapid increase in global maritime shipping, there is a great demand for the technology of maritime traffic monitoring to detect inappropriate encountering interaction between ships and prevent ship collision accidents. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect a large volume of maritime traffic data and investigate the collision avoidance behavior of real-world ships. Most collision avoidance systems are based on expert systems and simulations based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Those regulations outline the general principles underlying collision avoidance; however, they do not provide specific guidance and fail to account for the complexity of many real-world situations. Furthermore, guidance systems coordinating the movement of a ship must have the capacity to predict the movement behavior of all ships involved in potential encounter situations, and do so as early as possible for anti-collision reaction. Our objective in this study was to model the collision avoidance behaviors of human operators in order to formulate a set of realistic trajectory predictions for encountering near collision scenarios. By machine learning approach, the proposed framework is able to learn a model of interaction movement behavior from collected AIS historical traffic data involving near collision situations and then generate a set of predicted trajectories while ships encountering. The proposed model eliminates the need for a priori information related to environmental conditions and the rules governing encounter situations. The resulting projections can be used to suggest anti-collision paths for navigators or to guide the selection of collision-free paths for maritime autonomous surface ships.","maritime traffic monitoring,collision-free paths,Regulation,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,collision avoidance systems,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,control engineering computing,Predictive models,AIS network,ships,marine safety,global maritime shipping,anti-collision paths,International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,machine learning,Sea surface,expert systems,marine engineering computing,interaction movement behavior,encounter situation,Trajectory,collision avoidance behavior,trajectory prediction,AIS historical traffic data collection,ship collision accidents,Navigation,navigation,COLREG,collision avoidance,marine control,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime collision avoidance behavior prediction,"

In the second part of this paper, vessel state estimation and navigational trajectory prediction of a single-vessel situation are considered. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed for the estimation of vessel states and further used for the prediction of vessel trajectories. Finally, the proposed VTMIS is simulated, and successful simulation results are presented in this paper.","maritime traffic monitoring,vessel traffic information system,Kalman filters,extended Kalman filter,maritime surveillance system,ANN,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,neural networks,vessel navigational systems,maritime security,vessel tracking,neural nets,vessel trajectory,vessel state estimation (VSE),State estimation,object tracking,marine safety,marine engineering,Artificial neural networks,state estimation,vessel traffic monitoring and information system (VTMIS),ship detecting and tracking,Radar tracking,traffic information systems,vessel detection,artificial neural network,Trajectory,trajectory prediction,Extended Kalman filter (EKF),ocean navigation,VNS,Sensors,multiple-vessel situation,ship navigational trajectory prediction,VDT maneuvering,maritime safety,"
"monitoring of high biomass phaeocystis globosa blooms in the southern north sea by in situ and future spaceborne hyperspectral radiometry","2022","Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa hereafter) is a phytoplankton species which commonly blooms at high biomass in April–May in the Southern North Sea and forms undesirable foam which accumulates on the beaches. Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radiometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncertainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter-band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration.","Belgian coastal zone,Inter-band calibration,PANTHYR,Signal to noise ratio,Autonomous measurements,Hyperspectral radiometry,Hyperspectral satellite sensors,"
"real-time moving maritime objects segmentation and tracking for video communication","2006","Video object segmentation and tracking has been widely used in many video communication applications. This paper proposes an effective method of detecting and tracking the moving maritime objects in video sequences. An approximation algorithm, which adopts visual attention architecture to reduce the wavy noises and make the object distinct from the background, segments the regions of interest quickly. Then, a modified temporal differencing method is proposed to eliminate the background and detect the moving maritime object. On the multi-object tracking process, an adaptive choosing the global nearest neighbor algorithm is presented based on a linear dynamic model. Furthermore, an effective occlusion reasoning method is proposed, which partly solves the occlusion problem.

"a computer vision system to analyse the swimming behaviour of farmed fish in commercial aquaculture facilities: a case study using cage-held atlantic salmon","2011","Knowledge of fish behaviour plays an important role in aquaculture farm management. Video systems are the most common and cost-effective way of observing behaviours in commercial aquaculture operations. However long term observation is not feasible due to a limited ability to analyse footage manually. This paper describes preliminary findings obtained via computer vision software that was developed to automatically analyse fish movement and behaviours in aquaculture sea cages. Results show that the system is capable of detecting fish shapes in video recordings and from these shapes quantifying changes in swimming speed and direction continuously throughout the day. Also variations between days were detected and these may have been associated with the daily shift in the tidal cycle. The system has the potential to act as an alarm to farm operators, informing them about unusual fish behaviours on a continuous, real-time basis. It also has potential to assist in the evaluation of fish welfare.","Fish behaviour,Fish tracking,Kalman filter,Salmon aquaculture,Video analysis,Computer vision,"
"contrast enhancement for underwater images in maritime border protection","2017","Maritime border protection has an important role in border security. The increasing number of refugees migrating from one country to an another in illegal ways creates a potential risk for those countries having that of traffic. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, the majority of refugees and migrants are likely to be aboard unsafe boats that are prone to capsizing. For these types of situations, it is useful for law enforcement agencies to analyze the images of wreckages taken underwater in order to detect unlawful materials such as firearms, rifles, explosives. Furthermore, detection of the ensign of a capsized boat may give a clue about its possible departure information, which may lead to other kinds of intelligence that can be collected as well.","departure information,measure,contrast enhancement,law enforcement agency,firearms,United Nations Refugee Agency,color enhancement,image enhancement,underwater,Image color analysis,Casting,rifles,capsized boat,Discrete cosine transforms,maritime border protection,DCT,border security,underwater images,national security,wreckage images,Algorithm design and analysis,Imaging,explosives,Security,Color,"
"detection and geovisualization of abnormal vessel behavior from video","2021","Intelligent maritime situational awareness pursues an effective understanding of the majority of the activities related to the maritime domain (impacting the safety, security, economy, or environment), with the aid of artificial intelligence systems. Such an understanding requires the development of automated processes capable of not only detecting abnormal behavior but also of visually-representing and interpreting it. Although much progress has been made in anomaly detection and visualization using vessel self-reporting positioning data, there have been no corresponding advances using video data, despite the increasing use of cameras for maritime surveillance. In this work, we introduce a framework which goes beyond vessel tracking for anomaly detection in video, and is therefore applicable to scenes with a high density of vessels. The proposed framework detects abnormal behavior using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and interprets this knowledge using metrics derived from clustering the positions and courses provided by an independent vessel/motion detector. These detections are geovisualized using an advanced displaying tool where detected abnormal behavior may be localized on the globe, providing an infrastructure for intelligent maritime situational awareness.","generative adversarial network,surveillance,Safety,anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,data visualisation,Knowledge engineering,security of data,geovisualization,intelligent maritime situational awareness,marine engineering,abnormal vessel behavior,maritime surveillance,vessel self-reporting positioning data,object detection,maritime domain,Measurement,Real-time systems,video signal processing,artificial intelligence systems,Tools,artificial intelligence,Detectors,"
"computationally effective range migration compensation in pcl systems for maritime surveillance","2018","In this paper, we consider the possibility of extending the coherent processing interval (CPI) as a way to improve target detection capability in passive radars for maritime surveillance applications. Despite the low velocity of the considered targets, range walk effects could limit the performance of the system when long CPIs are considered. To overcome these limitations while keeping the computational load controlled, we resort to a sub-optimal implementation of the Keystone Transform (KT), based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation, recently presented by the authors and successfully applied against aerial targets. Following those promising results, we extend the proposed approach to a coastal surveillance scenario. In the considered case, since longer CPI values are used, the proposed strategy appears to be even more attractive with respect to a conventional KT implementation based on the Chirp-Z Transform interpolation. In fact, comparable detection performance are obtained with a remarkable computational load saving. In detail, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated against experimental data provided by Leonardo S.p.A., using a DVB-T based passive radar.","Chirp-Z Transform interpolation,marine radar,aerial targets,radar detection,passive radars,passive radar,transforms,passive coherent location,interpolation,target tracking,range migration compensation,target detection capability,Computational complexity,polynomials,object detection,search radar,digital video broadcasting,radar imaging,Interpolation,computational load saving,PCL systems,Keystone Trasform,DVB-T based passive radar,long coherent processing interval,coherent processing interval,Lagrange polynomial interpolation,Keystone Transform,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,walk effects,Signal to noise ratio,Surveillance,CPI values,Transforms,coastal surveillance scenario,KT implementation,"
"large environmental disturbances caused by magmatic activity during the late devonian hangenberg crisis","2020","A wide range of various proxies (e.g., mineralogy, organic carbon, inorganic geochemistry, C and Mo isotopes, and framboidal pyrite) were applied for interpretation of changing oceanic redox conditions, bioproductivity, and the regional history of magmatic activity. This resulted in internally consistent interpretation of the late Famennian Hangenberg Crisis in subtropical deepest water sites of the epeiric Rhenohercynian and Saxo–Thuringian basins, as well as more open sites of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. High mercury concentrations were detected in all of the studied sections, with the highest values strata in the Carnic Alps (up to 20 ppm) and Thuringia (up to 1.5 ppm). The beginning of the Hg anomaly and the presence of pyroclastic material, indicate that local magmatic activity was initiated before the deposition of the Hangenberg Black Shale (HBS). The onset of the HBS deposition coincided with the expansion of phosphate-enriched, anoxic to euxinic waters during short-lived CO2-greenhouse spike of a warm–humid climate. Intensive magmatic activity was a trigger for climatic changes, an excessive eutrophication, and an accelerated burial of organic carbon during the Hangenberg transgressive pulse. The injection of catastrophic amounts of CO2, toxic elements and acids from volcanic activity could have led to acidification, mutation of spores, and episodes of mass mortality of marine plankton.","Redox conditions,Carbon and molybdenum isotopes,Hangenberg Black Shale,Inorganic geochemistry,Volcanic activity,Mineralogical composition,"

"situational awareness measurement in a simulation-based training framework for offshore well control operations","2019","Human factors are identified as the major contributor to oil and gas drilling and operations related accidents. One major limitation of the currently available simulation-based training programs is the lack of objective and validated measures for human factors and non-technical skills. These objective measures are necessary to evaluate the skills and training of drilling crews. Situational awareness (SA) describes the person's perception, comprehension, and prediction in dynamic environments. SA is critical in time-sensitive decision making, which may be especially pertinent for kick-detection and blowout mitigation. This paper presents the analyses of multiple objective SA measures in an immersive training environment. The SA for a sample of engineering-in-training students (n = 13) was measured using a well control incident simulator. The data analyses include knowledge tests, a voice log analysis, usability measures, check-lists compliance, pre/post performance surveys, and eye-tracking data. The results show that task knowledge (e.g. current pressure readings, current bit depth) was predictive of overall blowout mitigation performance. Further, the usability results provide some preliminary insights into task risk perceptions, task difficulty, and perceptions of communication. The results may help design an objective simulation-based training framework for human factors and non-technical skills measurement in oil and gas well control operations.","Simulation-based training,Well control,Situation awareness,"

"anomaly detection and assessment of pm10 functional data at several locations in the klang valley, malaysia","2015","In environmental data sets, the occurrence of a high concentration of an unusual pollutant, more formally known as an anomaly, may indicate air quality problems. Thus, a critical understanding of the behavior of anomalies is increasingly becoming very important for air pollution investigations. This study was conducted to detect anomalies in daily PM10 functional data, to investigate the patterns of behavior as well as to identify possible factors that determine PM10 anomalies at three selected air quality monitoring stations (Klang, Kuala Selangor and Petaling Jaya) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The statistical method employed to detect these anomalies consisted of a combination of the robust projection pursuit and the robust Mahalanobis distance methods using air quality data recorded from 2005 to 2010. Analysis of obtained anomalous PM10 profiles showed that data recorded during El Nino years (2005, 2006 and 2009) contained the highest frequency of anomalies. More frequent anomalies appeared during the southwest (SW) monsoon which occurs in the months of July and August as well as during the northeast (NE) monsoon in February. A lesser number of anomalies were also observed during weekends compared to weekdays. The weekend and monsoonal effect phenomena were shown to be significantly existent at all stations while wind speed was positively associated with extreme PM10 anomalies at the Klang and Petaling Jaya stations. In conclusion, anomalies detection was found useful for air pollution investigation in this study. The findings of this study imply that the location and background of a station, as well as wind speed, seasonal (monsoon) and weekdays-weekend variations play important role in influencing PM10 anomalies.","anomaly detection,air quality monitoring,PM,functional data,"
"maritime ship target imaging with gnss-based passive multistatic radar","2023","In the field of maritime surveillance, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar has proven its potential for moving target detection (MTD), localization, and velocity estimation. The next stage is to investigate the possibility of obtaining the radar image of the moving ship for target recognition. However, the limited signal power budget of GNSS prevents the conventional inverse synthetic aperture radar technique that is based on target rotational motion and short observation time for GNSS-based passive radar imaging moving target. In this article, a two-stage imaging processing method relying on the target translational motion over a long observation time is proposed. The first stage confirms the presence of the target by a long-time MTD processing technique. In the second stage, based on the analysis of the Doppler history of the target signal in the slow-time domain, short-time Fourier transform and modified random sample consensus are combined to robustly estimate target velocity with reduced computation complexity. To obtain the focused bistatic image, azimuth compression is conducted by using the estimated target velocity. Finally, an image fusion operation is implemented to combine the bistatic images achievable from multiple satellites so that a multistatic image with high quality can be created. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the real experimental results of three cargo ships illuminated by several satellites.","moving ship,Fourier transforms,inverse synthetic aperture radar technique,focused bistatic image,GNSS-based passive multistatic radar,short-time Fourier transform,target detection,passive radar,Marine vehicles,image fusion operation,short observation time,long observation time,maritime ship target imaging,cargo ships,image fusion,target velocity estimation,ships,satellite navigation,maritime surveillance,estimated target velocity,two-stage imaging processing method,object detection,passive radar imaging,synthetic aperture radar,bistatic images,target rotational motion,radar imaging,Doppler effect,Radar,target translational motion,velocity estimation,Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based passive radar,Passive radar,Radar imaging,GNSS-based passive radar,target signal,Imaging,long-time MTD processing technique,slow-time domain,radar image,target recognition,multistatic image,Global navigation satellite system,global navigation satellite system-based passive radar,"
"spatio-temporal dynamics of the río de la plata turbidity front; combining remote sensing with in-situ measurements and numerical modeling","2021","The Río de la Plata is a micro-tidal estuary located in Southeast South America. With an annual mean flow of 26,500 m3/s, it receives 160 million tons/yr of suspended sediments. The high content of cohesive fine sediments in the estuary generates high turbidity levels in its inner and intermediate zones, which can be clearly seen in color satellite images. In this work, an image-based algorithm was successfully implemented to remotely detect the turbidity front of the Río de la Plata, based on the top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in the red band of MODIS-Aqua satellite. The algorithm finds the reflectance level that ‘best’ separates two water classes: turbid fluvial and clear ocean waters. The front dynamic was studied combining remotely sensed information and data of river discharge, winds, salinity and sea level time series, in the four-year period 2014–2017. River discharge was identified as the main external forcing, revealing a solid general pattern of behavior: when discharge was high (low) the front tended to be located in the outer (intermediate) zone of the estuary. Sea level seemed to be a secondary forcing, presenting higher correlations along the center of the estuary than near both coasts. Local winds needed to have a relatively persistent (2-day) component in a given direction to affect the location of the front. Additionally, results of an already implemented numerical model of the Río de la Plata were evaluated in terms of spatio-temporal performance, considering turbidity and salinity fronts locations. New strengths and limitations of the model were identified, and an improvement in the parameterization of sediments’ settling velocity was tested. Model results revealed the relative importance of bottom shear stress on the general location of the front, and of salinity on the flocculation process of cohesive sediments. This work provided new insights for the understanding of the Río de la Plata estuarine dynamics through the combination of three complementary tools – remote sensing, in situ data, and numerical modeling, – which may be extended to other systems around the world.","Satellite images,Discharge,Hydro-sedimentological model,Wind,Suspended sediments,Salinity,Sea surface level,Estuary,MODIS,"

Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"

"improved kinematic interpolation for ais trajectory reconstruction","2021","Ship trajectory information has made a significant contribution to the data-based research in analyzing maritime transportation and has facilitated the improvement of maritime safety. However, the AIS data, which consists of ship trajectory, inevitably contains noises or missing data that can interfere with the conclusion. In this paper, an improved kinematic interpolation is presented for AIS trajectory reconstruction, which integrates data preprocessing and interpolation that considers the ships' kinematic information. The improved kinematic reconstruction method includes four steps: (1) data preprocessing, (2) analysis of time interval distribution, (3) abnormal data detection and removal, (4) kinematic interpolation that takes the kinematic feature of ships (i.e., velocity and acceleration) into account, adding forward and backward track points to help correct the acceleration function of reconstruction points. The proposed method is tested on the AIS dataset of Zhoushan Port and was compared with traditional ship trajectory reconstruction methods. The comparison indicates that the proposed method can effectively reconstruct the ship trajectory with higher performance on a single ship trajectory and a large AIS data set of certain water areas.","Trajectory reconstruction,Ship trajectory,Kinematic interpolation,AIS,"
"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness.

The data available at the fusion center, as output of real world systems, contained incomplete information, compared to theoretical tracking and fusion algorithms. A method to estimate the missing information in the input data is described. Results obtained using real data as well as simulated data are presented. This type of fusion provides overall pictures of maritime areas, with benefits for surveillance against military threats, as well as threats to exclusive economic zones.","military radar,sensor fusion,marine radar,association algorithms,maritime areas surveillance,Aircraft,Marine vehicles,Global Positioning System,estimation theory,information fusion,military computing,automatic identification system,tracking algorithm,Target tracking,Educational institutions,search radar,Radar tracking,radar imaging,military threats,missing information estimation,overall maritime picture,Tracking,Sensor fusion,over-the-horizon radar,data association,economic zones,automatic identification systems,Surveillance,Research and development,Radar detection,"
"temporally stable feature clusters for maritime object tracking in visible and thermal imagery","2015","This paper describes a new approach to detect and track maritime objects in real time. The approach particularly addresses the highly dynamic maritime environment, panning cameras, target scale changes, and operates on both visible and thermal imagery. Object detection is based on agglomerative clustering of temporally stable features. Object extents are first determined based on persistence of detected features and their relative separation and motion attributes. An explicit cluster merging and splitting process handles object creation and separation. Stable object clusters are tracked frame-to-frame. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on four challenging real-world public datasets.","Target tracking,infrared imaging,object detection,thermal imagery,maritime object detection,dynamic maritime environment,panning cameras,Accuracy,maritime object tracking,Real-time systems,object tracking,Cameras,Detectors,target scale,Feature extraction,"
"satellite surveillance of fishing vessel activity in the ascension island exclusive economic zone and marine protected area","2019","Designation of large expanses of the ocean as Marine Protected Area (MPA) is increasingly advocated and realised. The effectiveness of such MPAs, however, requires improvements to vessel monitoring and enforcement capability. In 2014 commercial fishing was excluded from the Ascension Island Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In 2015, through updated regulations, a licenced fishery re-opened in the northern half of the EEZ while the southern half remained closed. To assess compliance with these closures and regulations, several promising satellite technologies (Satellite Automatic Identification System (S-AIS), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) of two vessels), were trialled alongside at-sea patrols. Use of SAR enabled assessment of ‘dark’ (non-AIS transmitting) vessels, the scope of whose activities are hardest to gauge. The high level of compliance with regulations observed, suggests the MPA may prove effective, yet a need for vigilance remains. Vessels aggregate near the EEZ border and a quarter of vessels tracked across three years exhibited S-AIS transmission gaps and present a heightened compliance risk. Use of remote, rather than local, expertise and infrastructure provide a blue-print and economies of scale for replicating monitoring across similarly sized MPAs; particularly for large (>~ 25 m) vessels with metallic superstructures conducive to SAR detection. Funding ongoing monitoring in Ascension is challenged by current levels of license uptake, which provides insufficient offsetting revenue. Satellite-derived intelligence, can be used to set risk thresholds and trigger detailed investigations. Planning long-term monitoring must, however, incorporate adequate resources for follow-up, through patrols and correspondence with flag-states and fisheries management organisations.","Satellite surveillance,Marine Protected Area,Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction,Compliance,High seas,Fisheries,"
"maritime radar target detection in sea clutter based on cnn with dual-perspective attention","2023","Radar-based maritime target detection plays an important role in ocean monitoring. Considering the practical application, pulse-compression radar is widely used in terms of civilian offshore surface target detection. The existence of sea clutter will greatly interfere the detection performance of pulse-compression radar. This leads to the low detection performance of traditional algorithms like constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Deep learning methods have made strides in many fields recently, such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Inspired by this idea, we propose a maritime radar target detection method in sea clutter based on convolution neural network (CNN) and dual-perspective attention (DPA). The proposed method first encodes the radar echo in high-dimensional space and then extracts the correlation features from the global and local perspectives through the attention mechanism. We deployed the X-band pulse-compression radar on the coast of Hainan, China, and collected a lot of measured data. Experimental results demonstrate that the detection performance of our method outperforms the traditional CFAR methods and the latest deep learning-based methods. In the measured dataset, our proposed method can reach a detection probability of 93.59% under a false alarm rate (FAR) of  $1e-3$ , reaching the practical application level.","latest deep learning-based methods,maritime target detection,deep learning (artificial intelligence),radar detection,radar clutter,Feature extraction,natural language processing,global perspectives,traditional CFAR methods,sea clutter,attention mechanism,detection probability,CNN,X-band pulse-compression radar,civilian offshore surface target detection,object detection,convolution neural network,pulse-compression radar,feature extraction,radar-based maritime target detection,local perspectives,maritime radar target detection method,Radar clutter,Radar,Convolution,convolutional neural nets,constant false alarm rate,low detection performance,dual-perspective attention,speech recognition,probability,Clutter,Deep learning,Object detection,radar echo,learning (artificial intelligence),Radar detection,"

"random finite set tracking for anomaly detection in the presence of clutter","2020","In this paper, a sequential Bayesian framework is proposed to address the task of joint anomaly detection and tracking for surveillance applications in the presence of clutter. This is achieved by modeling the anomaly as a switching unknown control input which goes into action by modifying the expected dynamics of a target and ceases its activity (becomes nonexistent) under nominal behavior. Random Finite Sets (RFS) make it possible to represent the switching nature of the object anomalous behavior and derive a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of a Bernoulli RFS for the unknown velocity input and the object kinematic state. In addition, the proposed HBF has been customized for maritime anomaly detection by using a piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process as dynamic model of vessels. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, and compare its performance in a maritime surveillance example with the Interacting Multiple Model Probabilistic Data Association Filter (IMM - PDAF) for different levels of clutter.","surveillance,sensor fusion,Anomaly detection,Bayes methods,Mathematical model,Switches,switching nature,switching unknown control input,Interacting Multiple Model Probabilistic Data Association Filter,Radio frequency,target tracking,unknown velocity input,sequential Bayesian framework,object tracking,Random Finite Sets,nominal behavior,surveillance applications,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Gaussian processes,Bernoulli RFS,Radar tracking,maritime anomaly detection,random Finite set tracking,clutter,joint anomaly detection,HBF,probability,Clutter,joint posterior density,object anomalous behavior,object kinematic state,Gaussian-mixture form,piecewise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,maritime surveillance example,"

"vc-gan: classifying vessel types by maritime trajectories using generative adversarial networks","2020","As maritime transport is the backbone of global trade, it is important to ensure the safety and security for sea transportation effectively. However, the dependence on experienced human operators for maritime surveillance does not scale in terms of coverage. While the ship information and trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be used to automate maritime surveillance, the AIS data may be modified deliberately or accidentally, resulting in difficulties in the detection of illegal maritime activities. We have developed VC-GAN for Vessel Classification using Generative Adversarial Networks to identify vessel types based solely on the vessel trajectories in areas of interest. Our VC-GAN framework adversarially trains a multi-class classifier by learning from the labelled AIS data to classify the types of the vessels of interest, as well as to detect the out-of-class vessels. We evaluated the proposed VC-GAN method on two maritime datasets in Europe and Southeast Asia. The experimental results showed that VC-GAN significantly outperformed other vessel classification methods, especially in detecting out-of-class vessels.","ship information,VC-GAN framework,Transportation,maritime datasets,trajectory data,Generative adversarial networks,vessel classification methods,global trade,experienced human operators,neural nets,labelled AIS data,maritime trajectories,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime transport,generative adversarial networks,Automatic Identification System,maritime surveillance,illegal maritime activities,image classification,sea transportation,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,Maritime Trajectories,VC-GAN method,vessel types,Trajectory,multiclass classifier,Vessel Type Classification,Surveillance,Tools,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,out-of-class vessels,Generative Adversarial Networks,"
"cyber incident scenarios in the maritime industry: risk assessment and mitigation strategies","2023","The maritime industry is facing an escalating concern of cybersecurity threats, which can be attributed to the rapid growth of digital technologies and the recent adoption of autonomous and semi-autonomous shipping. To address this issue, various published papers have proposed cyberattack scenarios aiming to increase cybersecurity awareness and enhance the security of maritime systems. This research aims to assess the cybersecurity threats in the maritime sector by presenting three practical cyberattack scenarios and their corresponding risks and mitigation strategies. The first scenario involves the risks associated with utilizing the systems of a tug-boat as part of an attack vector, the second scenario examines the systems involved in vessel harbour manoeuvres using a laser docking system or Radar, and the third scenario examines an insider attack through malicious or unauthorized access to the Berthing Aid System (BAS).","escalating concern,computer network security,Risk management,Safety,computer crime,Personnel,Industries,Companies,cyber-physical systems,Laser radar,Berthing Aid System,corresponding risks,ships,cybersecurity awareness,recent adoption,boats,risk management,cybersecurity threats,sea ports,mitigation strategies,risk assessment,cyber incident scenarios,maritime systems,marine communication,semiautonomous shipping,maritime industry,maritime sector,digital technologies,laser docking system,Radar detection,"
"novel climates: trajectories of climate change beyond the boundaries of british columbia’s forest management knowledge system","2018","The non-stationary climates of the 21st century are compelling forest managers to seek non-local species, provenances, and silvicultural regimes that are better suited to the anticipated future climates of their operating areas. Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province’s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC’s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.","Mahalanobis distance,Bioclimate,No-analog,Novel climates,Random Forest,Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification,"
"generating realistic cyber data for training and evaluating machine learning classifiers for network intrusion detection systems","2022","Cyberspace operations, in conjunction with artificial intelligence and machine learning enhanced cyberspace infrastructure, make it possible to connect sensors directly to shooters independent of human control. These technologies serve as the pivot around which cyber data from the military’s Internet of Battlefield Things, for example, will be turned into actionable insight and knowledge and, ultimately, an information advantage for the military. As such, network intrusion detection systems must detect, evaluate, and respond to malicious cyber traffic at machine speed. Generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders are fit as generative models with labeled cyber data from a real military enterprise network. These generative models are used to create realistic, synthetic cyber data. A combination of real and synthetic cyber data sets are then used to train several machine learning models for network intrusion detection. Purely synthetic data is shown to be statistically similar to the real data. There is no statistically significant difference in the performance of classifiers trained with real data versus a combination of real and synthetic data; however, classifiers trained with only synthetic data underperformed. To avoid a decrease in intrusion detection performance, classifiers must be trained with at least 15% real data.","Generative adversarial network,Variational autoencoder,Generative machine learning,Network intrusion detection,Synthetic data generation,"

"application of the jpda-ukf to hfsw radars for maritime situational awareness","2012","At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA). The purpose is to detect, track and classify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason, great interest is given to low-power/cost High-Frequency Surface-Wave (HFSW) radars as an early-warning tool for over-the-horizon (OTH) applications. However, in HFSW radars there is a trade-off in terms of quality and cost, i.e. the radar system exhibits poor azimuth resolution, high non-linearity, and significant false alarm rate. All these aspects reduce tracking performance if not properly addressed. In this context, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed. The tracking algorithm behavior is investigated by a comparison between the tracks generated by two HFSW radars, with overlapped fields of view, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. A discussion is provided about the possible effectiveness of HFSW radar fusion strategies.

The chapter illustrates the role that good implementation of HFE in design can play in making it easier to detect and recognize the significance of ‘weak signals’. Organizational and cultural factors will dominate an individuals willingness to take action if they do detect weak signals of trouble. But HFE has an important role to play in making weak signals stronger by design, as well as ensuring that signals that should be ‘strong’ and easy to detect are not made weak by the design of the work environment and equipment interfaces.","Theory of signal detection,Weak signals,Situation awareness,High reliability organisations,Human factors engineering,"
"uav-aided anti-jamming maritime communications: a deep reinforcement learning approach","2021","Maritime communication suffers from reactive jammer that keeps silent when the channel is idle and launches jamming signals as soon as sensing the activity on the channel to disrupt the maritime communication and even cause the maritime tracking and monitoring task failure. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based maritime anti-jamming communication scheme that applies the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the relay to forward the message between ships. This scheme enables both the transmitting ship and the UAV to select the power control policy without relying on the jamming model and the message generation model. Instead, the policies are chosen based on the current state consisting of the distances, the received signal strength indication, the received jamming power and the bit error rate (BER). We design two dueling neutral networks respectively to select the power control policy and update the network weights to reduce the overestimation. The dueling architecture consists of two streams that estimate the value of the current state and the state-dependent advantage function of the power control policy to accelerate the learning speed. A UAV-aided anti-jamming maritime communication game is formulated and the performance bound including the BER of marine messages and the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV is derived based on the Stackelberg equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the BER of the marine messages, and saves the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV to avoid being detected by the reactive jammer.","Bit error rate,message generation model,reactive jamming,remotely operated vehicles,Energy consumption,Games,reactive jammer,game theory,Reinforcement learning,monitoring task failure,Wireless communication,jamming,deep reinforcement learning,received jamming power,ships,error statistics,Maritime communications,unmanned aerial vehicle,jamming model,maritime communication suffers,UAV-aided anti-jamming maritime communications,Power control,reinforcement learning,BER,Autonomous aerial vehicles,transmitting ship,received signal strength indication,marine messages,autonomous aerial vehicles,power control policy,UAV-aided anti-jamming maritime communication game,power control,dueling neutral networks,state-dependent advantage function,learning speed,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime tracking,UAV,maritime anti-jamming communication scheme,"
"ocean oil spill detection from sar images based on multi-channel deep learning semantic segmentation","2023","One of the major threats to marine ecosystems is pollution, particularly, that associated with the offshore oil and gas industry. Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea.

Currently, the methods used to diagnose COVID-19 have several limitations, thus new techniques need to be investigated to improve the diagnosis and overcome these limitations. Taking into consideration the great benefits of electrocardiogram (ECG) applications, this paper proposes a new pipeline called ECG-BiCoNet to investigate the potential of using ECG data for diagnosing COVID-19. ECG-BiCoNet employs five deep learning models of distinct structural design. ECG-BiCoNet extracts two levels of features from two different layers of each deep learning technique. Features mined from higher layers are fused using discrete wavelet transform and then integrated with lower-layers features. Afterward, a feature selection approach is utilized. Finally, an ensemble classification system is built to merge predictions of three machine learning classifiers. ECG-BiCoNet accomplishes two classification categories, binary and multiclass. The results of ECG-BiCoNet present a promising COVID-19 performance with an accuracy of 98.8% and 91.73% for binary and multiclass classification categories. These results verify that ECG data may be used to diagnose COVID-19 which can help clinicians in the automatic diagnosis and overcome limitations of manual diagnosis.","ECG trace Image,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,COVID-19,Convolutional neural networks (CNN),"

"an ensemble-based assessment of bias adjustment performance, changes in hydrometeorological predictors and compound extreme events in eas-cordex","2023","The effectiveness of adaptive measures tackling the effects of climate change is dependent on robust climate projections. This becomes even more important in the face of intensifying extreme events. One example of these events is flooding, which embodies a major threat to highly vulnerable coastal urban areas. This includes eastern Asia, where multiple coastal megacities are located, e.g. Shanghai and Shenzhen. While the ability of general circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) to project atmospheric changes associated with these events has improved, systematic errors (biases) remain. This study therefore assess capabilities of improving the quality of regional climate projections for eastern Asia. This is performed by evaluating an ensemble consisting of bias adjustment methods, GCM-RCM model runs and future emission scenarios based on representative concentration pathways (RCP) obtained from EAS-CORDEX. We show that bias adjustment significantly improves the quality of model output and best results are obtained by applying quantile delta mapping. Based on these results we evaluate potential future changes in crucial hydrometeorological predictors, univariate extreme events and compound extreme events, focusing on high wind speeds and extreme precipitation. Key findings include an increase in daily maximum temperature of 1.5 to nearly 4 °C, depending on the scenario, as well as increased levels of precipitation under RCP 8.5. Furthermore, a distinct intensification of extreme events including high temperatures and heavy precipitation is detected and this increase exceeds the increase of the overall mean of these predictors. The annual number of compound events including heavy precipitation and extreme wind speeds shows a significant increase of up to 50% for RCP 8.5 in the South China Sea as well as the adjacent coastal areas.","Bias adjustment,Model evaluation,Predictions,Compound events,East asia,Uncertainty assessment,"

"a novel monostatic sar hrws imaging scheme for maritime surveillance","2016","This paper focuses on the problem of maritime surveillance for ship detection and proposes a novel monostatic SAR high resolution wide swath imaging scheme. The scheme changes the way that Scan SAR illuminates sub-scenes, and proposes a scanning mode using the prior information of ships' spatial distribution in each sub-scene. Firstly, a method based on range profiles is used to obtain the target number in each sub-scene. After that, the radar illuminates each sub-scene in a probability calculated by a transfer-probability matrix. Finally, a compress sensing algorithm is utilized to reconstruct each sub-scene using the obtained sparse aperture echo data, and the whole wide swath image is joint by putting all the sub-scenes together.

"lmd-tshipâ‹†: vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark for autonomous navigation applications","2021","Accurate ship tracking is very important for the security of maritime activities, especially the raising requirements of autonomous navigation applications, e.g., autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Unlike deep-learning-based object-tracking methods are prevailing in autonomous driving because of good environmental robustness and high tracking accuracy, few deep-tracking models can be found for maritime ships. The main reason for that is the lack of qualified ship datasets, especially datasets with ship-based perspectives. Therefore, a large-scale, high-definition dataset for ship tracking, LMD-TShip (Large Maritime Dataset), is provided in this paper. In this dataset, five types of ships are included, from cargo ships, fishing ships, passenger ships, and speed boats to unmanned ships. Specifically, LMD-TShip consists of 40,240 frames in 191 videos, each of which is carefully and manually annotated with bounding boxes in YOLO format. Moreover, 13 attributes are used to label videos, e.g., scale variation (SV), occlusion (OCC), basically covering tracking challenges of maritime ship tracking. Next, a detailed analysis is carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of LMD-TShip. Finally, experiments with five baseline short-term tracking models on the dataset are performed, e.g., ECO, SiamRPN++, and the experimental results demonstrate its good evaluation ability, which will provide effective means for training and testing tracking models related to maritime ships.","LMD-TShip,speed boats,Hidden Markov models,YOLO format,Cameras,Marine vehicles,tracking accuracy,cargo ships,ship tracking dataset,Videos,Visual tracking,video annotation,object tracking,ships,maritime activities security,Biological system modeling,unmanned ships,boats,Target tracking,object detection,deep-learning-based object-tracking methods,image annotation,Radar tracking,autonomous surface vehicles,telerobotics,autonomous driving,video signal processing,maritime environment,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,passenger ships,deep-tracking models,vision based large-scale maritime ship tracking benchmark,autonomous navigation,fishing ships,Large Maritime Dataset,autonomous navigation applications,"
"algorithm design of maritime wireless communication resources based on interference alignment","2022","With the increasing tension of wireless spectrum, interference has become a bottleneck problem in future wireless communication, and the urgency of interference management is particularly prominent. Traditional interference management methods have the defects of low spectral efficiency or limited interference. As a technology that can effectively improve network freedom and spectral efficiency, interference alignment can obtain greater gain compared with traditional methods, and has great potential in theory. As an effective means of interference management, interference alignment technology has been widely studied, and the difficulty of interference alignment is how to design the precoding matrix at the transmitting end and the decoding matrix at the receiving end, so as to meet the needs of system freedom. In the field of modern maritime communication, there are more and more application fields based on wireless technology, such as maritime detection, target detection and scheduling, which need to use wireless resources for data transmission, while maritime wireless resources are very tight.

"evaluation of uav and satellite-derived ndvi to map maritime antarctic vegetation","2020","Expansion of Antarctic vegetation in ice-free areas underlines the need for effective remote sensing techniques to properly monitor the changes. Detection and mapping of vegetation remains limited in the Antarctic environment given the complexity of its surface coverage. Some cryptogamic species exhibit low reflectance in the near-infrared region and are not easily detected by vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, spectral reflectance of Antarctic vegetation is highly variable according to seasonal conditions, which may influence NDVI results. As ultra-high resolution aerial imagery allows for a detailed analysis of vegetation and enables the validation of satellite imagery, in this study we assess the ability of the NDVI from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to identify vegetated areas in the ice-free environment of Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. NDVI classification with class ranges set by statistical parameters (i.e., mean and standard deviation) is performed. The results show that different sensors provide different NDVI values for the same vegetation class. NDVI classification enabled the identification of areas showing vegetation cover, which are in accordance with the manually mapped areas in the UAV image. Correspondence in vegetation distribution and classes can be observed across all classifications, demonstrating that aerial and satellite imagery may be used for Antarctic vegetation monitoring. A close association between NDVI classes and Antarctic vegetation type is identified, where lichens are generally classified in lower probability classes, and algae and moss in higher probability classes. This article shows the potential of NDVI applied to Antarctic vegetation and the significance of data statistical parameters in the selection of thresholds, reducing the need for ground-truth information in remote areas.","Landsat,NDVI,Sentinel-2,Remote sensing,Vegetation mapping,Antarctica,UAV,"

"advances in integrated system health management for mission-essential and safety-critical aerospace applications","2022","Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) is a promising technology that fuses sensor data and historical state-of-health information of components and subsystems to provide actionable information and enable intelligent decision-making regarding the operation and maintenance of aerospace systems. ISHM fundamentally relies on assessments and predictions of system health, including the early detection of failures and estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Model-based, data-driven or hybrid reasoning techniques can be utilized to maximise the timeliness and reliability of diagnosis and prognosis information. The benefits of ISHM include enhancing the maintainability, reliability, safety and performance of systems. The next evolution of the ISHM concept, Intelligent Health and Mission Management (IHMM), delves deeper into the utilization of on-line system health predictions to modify mission profiles to ensure safety and reliability, as well as efficiency through predictive integrity. This concept is particularly important for Trusted Autonomous System (TAS) applications, where an accurate assessment of the current and future system state-of-health to make operational decisions (with or without human intervention) is integral to both flight safety and mission success. IHMM systems introduce the capability of predicting degradation in the functional performance of subsystems, with sufficient time to dynamically identify which appropriate restorative or reconfiguration actions to take in order to ensure that the system can perform at an acceptable level of operational capability before the onset of a failure event. This paper reviews some of the key advancements and contributions to knowledge in the field of ISHM for the aerospace industry, with a particular focus on various architectures and reasoning strategies involving the use of artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the key challenges faced in the development and deployment of ISHM systems in the aerospace industry and highlights the safety-critical role that IHMM will play in future cyber-physical and autonomous system applications (both vehicle and ground support systems), such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS).","UAS,UTM,Unmanned aircraft system,Avionics,Artificial intelligence,Health and usage monitoring systems,Distributed satellite systems,Intelligent health and mission management,Diagnostics,Satellite systems,Prognostics,Integrated system health management,Machine learning,UAS Traffic management,"
"intelligent marine area supervision based on ais and radar fusion","2023","A weighted track fusion algorithm is proposed to address the complexity of conventional sea monitoring data and the lack of effective and convenient monitoring methods. The new algorithm uses local information entropy and fuses data from the automatic identification system (AIS) and X-band radar. The new model employs ship monitoring data to detect five types of abnormal ship behavior: speed, course, position, ship spacing, and time abnormalities. The method weights various factors using a weight matrix built up from a distance difference matrix between different track points and calculations of the distance information entropy and residual degree using information entropy theory. We tested the proposed weighted track fusion algorithm the fusion accuracy using actual data for 2813 ships, AIS, and radar track points based on local information entropy. The resulting correlation accuracy was 95.54% for 2716 ship track points and a correlation accuracy of 90.72% for 97 ship tracks. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for fusing multiple tracks and is more robust than traditional fusion methods.","Intelligent supervision,Abnormal behavior,Radar,AIS,"
"wind turbine high-speed shaft bearings health prognosis through a spectral kurtosis-derived indices and svr","2017","A significant number of failures of wind turbine drivetrains occur in the high-speed shaft bearings. In this paper, a vibration-based prognostic and health monitoring methodology for wind turbine high-speed shaft bearing (HSSB) is proposed using a spectral kurtosis (SK) data-driven approach. Indeed, time domain indices derived from SK are used and a comparative study is performed with frequently used time-domain features in the bearing degradation health assessment. The effectiveness is quantified by two measures, i.e., monotonicity and trendability. Among those features, the area under SK is utilized for the first time as a condition indicator of rolling bearing fault. A support vector regression (SVR) model was trained and tested for the prediction of the HSSB lifetime prognostics, showing the superiority of SK-derived indices of degradation assessment. We verified the potential of the prognostics method using real measured data from a drivetrain wind turbine. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can successfully detect an early failure and can better estimate the degradation trend of HSSB than traditional time-domain vibration features.","Fault prognosis,High speed shaft bearing,Kurtogram,Spectral kurtosis,Support vector regression,"

"coastal water bathymetry for critical zone management using regression tree models from gaofen-6 imagery","2021","Coastal water depth information is fundamental to coast management and coastal critical zone development. The traditional bathymetric sounding method depends on radar or surveying vessels, which are expensive and time-consuming. Thus, it is of high importance to develop a rapidly updating water depth detection method. In order to bridge this gap, we explored the Chinese Gaofen-6 wide field of view (GF-6 WFV) visible-near infrared satellite imagery for large-scale accurate coastal bathymetric mapping and to understand the vertical water column environment with regression tree models. The predictors, including the Blue band/Violet band (BV), Green band/Violet band (GV), Yellow band/Violet band (YV), Green band (G), Yellow band (Y), and red-edge1 band (Re1), were derived via statistical analysis, as well as spectroscopy knowledge and experience. Compared with the conventional bathymetric method, such as single band algorithm (SBA), band ratio algorithm and support vector regression (SVR), the two regression trees used in this study yielded better accuracy. The R2, MAE and RMSE of the classification and regression tree (CART), the Cubist tree model were 0.74, 3.78 m and 5.35 m vs 0.78, 3.56 m and 4.88 m. Besides the improved accuracies, these tree-based models can effectively reveal water depth-associated environment types with the hierarchical relationships present in the visible spectral characteristics, which supports spatial zoning strategies for coastal critical zone management based on the Gaofen-6 imagery.","Bathymetry,Violet-related spectral ratio,Regression trees,SVR,Gaofen-6 satellite,Critical coastal zone management,"
"change in forest condition: characterizing non-stand replacing disturbances using time series satellite imagery","2020","Objective information is required to monitor and characterize disturbances and disturbance regimes as related to changing climate and anthropogenic pressures. Forest disturbances occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales, with varying extent, severity, and persistence. To date, most of our understanding of detecting forest disturbances using remotely sensed imagery has been based on detecting abrupt and rapid, stand replacing disturbances, such as those related to wildfire and forest harvesting. Conversely, more continuous, subtle, and gradual non-stand replacing (NSR) disturbances, such as those related to drought stress or insect infestation have been subject to less focus. This can be attributed to the variability of NSR in space and time, as well as detection difficulties due to their often-subtle alterations to forest canopies and structure. Time series remote sensing techniques offer new opportunities for the capture and characterization of NSR disturbances. In this research, we investigate NSR disturbances as detected using a Landsat time series-based disturbance detection algorithm, Composite2Change (C2C) applied to the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada. We first examined three key characteristics of the spectral trajectory of NSR disturbances: pre-disturbance conditions, disturbance severity and disturbance persistence. From these characteristics, we defined seven typical NSR patterns (exemplars) for Canada’s forested ecosystems. Using annual information on predicted stand-level cover and biomass, we found that all NSR exemplars resulted in a loss of canopy cover, ranging from an average loss of between 5 and 31%. For instance, the most common exemplar was linked to a 15% reduction in canopy cover and a 13 Mg/ha reduction in biomass. While stands lost biomass, over the duration of the NSR, most stands increased slightly in stand height likely due to growth of the remaining trees or release from competition from the remaining stems. Comparing exemplars across Canada with independent data on NSR disturbance events confirmed that NSR exemplars that had larger severities, and shorter disturbance persistence times, were more commonly associated with insect infestations (e.g. mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)), whereas exemplars with a lower severity, and longer persistence were more commonly associated with drought events. Developing a nomenclature around remote sensing based characteristics of NSR disturbances provides an approach to both map NSR disturbances and better understand their impact on forest attributes, as well as provide tools to assess if these disturbanes are changing over space and time.","Landsat,Time series,Land cover,Disturbance,Insects,drought,Land use,"
"high resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects","2003","This paper presents the results of high resolution magnetic cartography realized with a caesium vapor magnetometer on marshland plots in Western France. This site is interesting because of the clayey substratum homogeneity and the historical knowledge of plot exploitation. A wooden truck running on PVC rails allowed acquisition of accurate signals with dynamics of about 2 nT. Natural grassland presents weak decametric variations correlated to a micro-toposequence. Conversely, plots recently tilled show linear magnetic anomalies. These anomalies are interpreted as the effect of tractor tyre soil compaction which modify soil properties. In addition, the study of a drained plot, by a wavelet transform, reveals the presence of a frequency band close to the drain intervals. Moreover, the magnitude of the linear magnetic anomalies is higher above drains. This suggests that the compaction influence on the magnetic carriers is more important in drained, hence aerated, zones.","magnetic survey,soil tillage,compaction,drainage,"

"ship collision avoidance behaviour recognition and analysis based on ais data","2022","A novel approach is proposed to automatically identify the ship collision avoidance behaviour from ship trajectories based on an improved Sliding Window Algorithm. The approach has three main stages: (1) determining the ships’ obligations according to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs); (2) assessing the rudder angle according to the true bearing of the target ship; (3) identifying the corresponding ship handling behaviour from the ship trajectory taking into account the Rate of Turn and its derivative based on the Sliding Window Algorithm. Four typical encounter scenarios are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach is then applied to near collision scenarios identified in the maritime traffic off the continental coast of Portugal, which allowed the characterization of the relative and spatial distributions of the locations at which the ships take evasive manoeuvres. The results show that the approach can be applied to accurately detect the ship collision avoidance behaviour from Automatic Identification System trajectory data, and the characterization of the collision avoidance behaviour can potentially be used by situational awareness systems and as the basis for ship collision avoidance decision-making.","Ship evasive manoeuvring,Near collision scenario,Collision avoidance,Sliding window Algorithm,"

Indeed, SG cyber-physical connectivity is subject to several vulnerabilities that can damage or disrupt its process immunity via cyberthreats. Today's ICSs are experiencing highly complex data change and dynamism, increasing the complexity of detecting and mitigating cyberattacks. Subsequently, and since Machine Learning (ML) is widely studied in cybersecurity, the objectives of this paper are twofold. First, for algorithmic simplicity, a small-scale ML algorithm that attempts to reduce computational costs is proposed. The algorithm adopts a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to easily and efficiently accomplish the learning procedures. Second, to solve the data complexity problem regarding rapid change and dynamism, a label autoencoding approach is introduced for Embedding Labels in the NAHL (EL-NAHL) architecture to take advantage of labels propagation when separating data scatters. Furthermore, to provide a more realistic analysis by addressing real-world threat scenarios, a dataset of an electric traction substation used in the high-speed rail industry is adopted in this work.

In this chapter, an insight on the use of RS platforms is provided for TC research and forecasting along with the application to the study of their detection, radial, structural, meteorological, and ocean characteristic features. Furthermore, the impact of satellite RS on TC forecast with respect to reduction in track and forecast errors is discussed. Also, the role played by various agencies of different countries is emphasized.","LIDAR,Remote sensing,Satellite observations,Radar,Tropical cyclone,"
"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"

Rarely any common contaminants are smog, nicotine, mold, yeast, biogas, or carbon dioxide. The paper will primarily observe, visualize and anticipate pollution levels. In particular, three algorithms of Artificial Intelligence were used to create good forecasting models and a predictive AQI model for 4 distinct gases: carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and atmospheric particulate matter. Thus, in this paper, the Air Qualification Index is developed utilizing Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree GBDT Ensembles model over the next 5 h and analyzes air qualities using various sensors. The hypothesized artificial intelligence models are evaluated to the Root Mean Squares Error, Mean Squared Error and Mean absolute error, depending upon the performance measurements and a lower error value model is chosen. Based on the algorithm of the Artificial Intelligent System, the level of 5 air pollutants like CO2, SO2, NO2, PM 2.5 and PM10 can be predicted immediately by integrating the observations with errors.

"palaeomagnetism and magnetic anisotropy of carboniferous red beds from the maritime provinces of canada: evidence for shallow palaeomagnetic inclinations and implications for north american apparent polar wander","2010","A palaeomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy study was conducted on the lower-middle Carboniferous Maringouin and Shepody red bed formations of the Maritime Provinces of Canada to detect and correct inclination shallowing. Because of the shallow inclinations commonly observed in red beds and the strong dependence of North America's Palaeo-Mesozoic apparent polar wander (APW) on red beds, inclination shallowing may substantially affect large portions of North America's APW path. Hematite is the primary magnetic mineral carrier in these red beds, accompanied by secondary magnetite, maghemite, goethite and pigmentary hematite. Thermal and chemical demagnetization of the Shepody Fm. successfully isolated characteristic remanence directions of D= 177Â°, I= 20.4Â°, Î±95= 6.5Â°, N= 19 and D= 177.8Â°I= 17.7Â°, Î±95= 6.9Â°, N= 16, respectively. Thermal demagnetization of the Maringouin Fm. isolated a characteristic remanence direction of D= 178.7Â°, I= 24.9Â°, Î±95= 14.5Â°, N= 9.High field anisotropy of isothermal remanence followed by alternating field and thermal cleaning on leached samples was used to isolate the fabric of hematite. Individual particle anisotropy was measured directly from magnetic separates using a new technique. Hematite's magnetic fabric and particle anisotropy were used to apply an inclination correction. Our inclination corrections indicate up to 10Â° of inclination shallowing, corresponding to corrected palaeopole positions of 27.2Â°N, 118.3Â°E, A95= 6.2Â° and 27.4Â°N, 117.2Â°E, A95= 13.1Â° for the Shepody and Maringouin formations, respectively. This correction corresponds to a âˆ¼ 6Â° increase in colatitude for Carboniferous North America, which translates into approximately a 650 km change in North America's palaeogeographic position. The proposed position of North America supports a Pangea B-type reconstruction.","Palaeomagnetism applied to Tectonics,Magnetic mineralogy and petrology,Palaeomagnetism applied to geologic processes,Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy,Rock and mineral magnetism,"
"magnetic detection of ship ballast deposits and anchorage sites in king herod's roman harbour, caesarea maritima, israel","2009","Ballast stone deposits are a common feature of sediments in ancient harbour basins but are often overlooked as a potential source of archaeological information. Recent geophysical investigations at Caesarea Maritima in Israel have discovered a thick, laterally extensive ballast layer in the area seaward of the 1st c. BC Roman harbour. The ballast deposits were identified by low-relief mounds on the seabed with elevated magnetic intensities. Jet probing and excavation of magnetic anomalies at several locations revealed a 20–60cm thick rubble layer containing large quantities of Late Roman and Byzantine pottery, local sedimentary boulders (kurkar sandstone, limestone cobbles) and foreign igneous and metamorphic boulders (granite, schist, volcanics; ca. 50%). The foreign boulders and pottery identify the rubble layer as ballast and ships refuse jettisoned by merchant ships outside the harbour. The strong magnetic contrast between the ballast deposits and the natural seabed sediments is attributed to the high magnetic susceptibility (>10−3SI) of crystalline boulders and pottery materials within the ballast rubble. AMS 14C and OSL dates and pottery evidence indicate the ballast accumulation began in the Late Roman period (ca. 200–330 AD) and continued well into the Late Byzantine (ca. 7th c. AD). The main phase of ballast deposition (ca. 4th–5th c. AD) coincided with a decline in the state of Caesarea's harbour following a destructive tsunami event in the early 2nd c. AD and records a shift to a more intensive use of the area seaward of the harbour as an anchorage and ballast lightening area.","Harbour,Magnetic survey,Caesarea Maritima,Ballast,Anchorages,"

"hyperspectral anomaly detection with local correlation fractional fourier transform and vector pulse coupled neural network","2022","Hyperspectral anomaly detection has attracted widespread attention because of its significant practical application value. However, the existence of noise and the lack of target spatial shape and texture features in hyperspectral image (HSI) limit the performance of hyperspectral anomaly detection. Here, we present a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method by local correlation fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) and vector pulse coupled neural network (VPCNN). First, combined with the correlation between local pixels, the HSI is transformed into the fractional Fourier domain through the proposed local correlation FrFT, which can suppress noise and background while preserving anomaly targets features in the HSI. Second, the VPCNN, which can effectively deal with the lack of spatial shape and texture features of the target, is proposed to segment the transformed HSI into different regions to obtain the segmentation image. Finally, anomaly detection result is extracted from the segmentation image. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that the proposed method has better superiority and advancement compared with other state-of-the-art alternative methods. We hope that our research will inspire the application of segmentation methods in related fields.","Fractional Fourier transform,Hyperspectral anomaly detection,Hyperspectral image,Vector pulse coupled neural network,"
"locating submerged prehistoric settlements: a new underwater survey method using water-jet coring and micro-geoarchaeological techniques","2021","In the past few decades the field of submerged prehistory has produced important data highlighting ancient coastal habitation across the globe. Most prehistoric underwater sites are discovered by chance (e.g., by industry, fishermen or recreational divers). New methods for detecting submerged prehistoric settlements have been developed using sophisticated remote sensing devices, yet with limited success. Simple, practical, and inexpensive methods for locating submerged settlements remain rare. Over 60 years of underwater archaeology and submerged prehistory in Israel, specifically along the Carmel coast, has led to a model for locating and studying submerged settlements, based on sand removal by storms. This study aimed to take this model a step further by developing a new, inexpensive method to identify, locate and characterize submerged sites. We collected undisturbed paleosol cores from exposed areas as well as under a few meters of sand, using a newly developed water-jet core sampling system. The cores were analyzed using micro-geoarchaeological techniques initially developed on terrestrial sites. The rationale behind this methodology is based on established knowledge that where human settlements occur, sediments are enriched by specific mineralogical signatures (e.g., heated clay minerals) and anthropogenic micro-remain assemblages (e.g., phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites). Additionally, micromorphology can assist in identifying micro-stratigraphic patterns typical of human settlements. We tested sediment cores in three underwater contexts: a) exposed prehistoric surfaces within two known Neolithic sites (Atlit-Yam and Neve Yam), b) exposed paleosols without visible archaeological remains (serving as a control), and c) as a blind test, a buried paleosol currently covered by 1–3 m of sand, where the existence of a site is unknown. In the cores taken from the exposed Neolithic settlements, the micro-geoarchaeological characterization showed clear anthropogenic signals (typical mineralogy, elevated micro-remain concentrations, micro-stratigraphy). In the paleosol control cores, there was an absence (or negligible presence) of anthropogenic signals. The ‘blind test’ at the sand-covered locality revealed sediments without anthropogenic enrichments (similar to the control paleosols), thus suggesting the absence of a submerged settlement in this specific location. The new method is time- and cost-effective and can easily be applied worldwide along the shallow continental shelf as well as in deep water. The new method will facilitate discovery of new underwater sites and provide selection criteria (e.g., where the highest anthropogenic signal exists) for investment in underwater excavations. Additionally, it can be used to check for anthropogenic signals in buried locations detected by remote sensing, and to understand the spatial organization of submerged sites.","Manual coring,Neolithic Carmel coast,Micro-geoarchaeology,Submerged prehistory,Underwater archaeology,Water-jet coring,"

"chapter 5 - food defense","2018","Governments and food manufacturers must consider the possibility that disgruntled individuals, criminals, terrorists, and other antisocial groups may intentionally contaminate food and threaten the safety of the agrifood chain. Also the number of economically motivated acts of intentional food adulteration is on the rise. As unintentional outbreaks of foodborne disease may severely harm sensitive consumers and because food trade is highly interconnected, an attack on one country’s food supply can have global personal, social, economic, and political impacts. Therefore, nations and food producers must take responsibility in protecting the agrifood chain against malicious and economically motivated acts of food tampering. Reducing the likeliness of deliberate contamination of agriculture and food products requires the implementation of food defense strategies. Food defense aims to mitigate the risks and hazards of intentional contamination in food operations by introducing a selection of countermeasures to make vulnerable elements in the agrifood chain/food operation more secure. However, although food defense builds barriers around vulnerable points to prohibit intentional adulteration, it cannot prevent it. Therefore, there is a need for a sensitive surveillance system to detect acts of intentional food contamination quickly, an alert system to recognize an incident involving food, and a program that must prepare the operation in responding to assaults of intentional food contamination. Response includes all measures to quickly and efficiently identify, contain, and minimize the impact of an intentional food contamination incident (e.g., by recall of suspected products), and to allow the food producer to recover and regain normal production levels. Preparedness also includes being trained in adequate risk and crisis communication, as it is what makes a public outrage different from a collaboration when addressing a food defense incident. This book chapter provides guidance to the food industry and public authorities for preventing and tackling intentional acts of food contamination.","food contamination,agroterrorism,chemical agents,foodborne disease,biological agents,food terrorism,"

The Italian/Dutch satellite BeppoSAX (1996–2002) was one of the most important high-energy astrophysics missions, especially for what concerns the field of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Its payload housed the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM), a segmented detector that could, in principle, have observed TGFs as well. Motivated by this possibility, we carried out, for the first time, a systematic search for TGFs in the BeppoSAX data archive, ending up with a sample of 12 TGF candidates.

"cae: contextual auto-encoder for multivariate time-series anomaly detection in air transportation","2022","The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast protocol is one of the latest compulsory advances in air surveillance. While it supports the tracking of the ever-growing number of aircraft in the air, it also introduces cybersecurity issues that must be mitigated e.g., false data injection attacks where an attacker emits fake surveillance information. The recent data sources and tools available to obtain flight tracking records allow the researchers to create datasets and develop Machine Learning models capable of detecting such anomalies in En-Route trajectories. In this context, we propose a novel multivariate anomaly detection model called Contextual Auto-Encoder (CAE). It uses the baseline of a regular LSTM-based auto-encoder but with several decoders, each getting data of a specific flight phase (e.g. climbing, cruising or descending) during its training. To illustrate the CAE’s efficiency, an evaluation dataset was created using real-life anomalies as well as realistically crafted trajectory modifications, with which the CAE as well as three anomaly detection models from the literature were evaluated. Results show that the CAE achieves better results in both accuracy and speed of detection. The dataset, the models implementations and the evaluation results are available in an online repository, thereby enabling replicability and facilitating future experiments.","Air traffic security,Anomaly detection,Multivariate time series,CAE,ADS-B,"

"doppler estimation for dvb-t based passive radar systems on moving maritime platforms","2015","PR (Passive Radar) systems using digital broadcasting services such as DVB-T (Digital Versatile Broadcasting - Terrestrial) transmission as illuminators represent surveillance solutions which have rapidly evolved and matured over recent years. PR systems typically use coherent integration time in the order of a few hundred milliseconds to acquire enough dynamic for the detection of moving objects. This is done under the assumption that both the illuminator of opportunity and the receiver stay static during this time period. However, advances in miniaturization of high performing computers and data storage devices allowed the design of PR systems that are compact enough to be operated onboard of moving platforms such as cars [1] and airplanes [2], [3]. Deploying PR systems on maritime platforms could enable covert surveillance of small land or sea based targets in littoral environment. A receiver mounted on such a platform may be subjected to highly non-linear motions. In this case a reference signal generated under the assumption of a static scenario may de-correlate from measured Doppler shifted surveillance channel and consequently degrade the PR systems detection performance. Compensation of these detrimental effects requires highly sampled and accurate measurements of the vessels Doppler shift with respect to the transmitter. To study these effects a two channel PR system for DVB-T broadcast reception has been deployed on a small boat to acquire platform motion data in a littoral environment. Based on the data gathered in this trial, a robust method for the Doppler estimation was developed, which uses the DVB-T standards OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) signal features.

Besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory, topic modeling popular in the field of Natural Language Processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents. This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"

Previous studies have suggested that the presence of surfactants in coastal aerosols may result in vegetation damage without specifically detecting or quantifying these surfactants. Coastal aerosols were collected at a remote site (Porquerolles Island-Var, France) and at a more anthropised site (San Rossore National Park-Tuscany, Italy). The chemical data were interpreted according to a comprehensive local meteorological analysis aiming to decipher the airborne source and transport processes of these classes of compounds. The LAS concentration (anthropogenic surfactants) was measured in the samples using LC-MS/MS, a specific analytical method. The values were compared with the MBAS concentration, determined by a non-specific analytical method. At Porquerolles, the MBAS concentration (103 ± 93 ng m−3) in the summer samples was significantly higher than in the winter samples. In contrast, LAS concentrations were rarely greater than in the blank filters. At San Rossore, the mean annual MBAS concentration (887 ± 473 ng m−3 in PM10) contributed about 10% to the total atmospheric particulate organic matter. LAS mean concentration in these same aerosol samples was 11.5 ± 10.5 ng m−3. A similar MBAS (529 ± 454 ng m−3) – LAS (7.1 ± 4.1 ng m−3 LAS) ratio of ∼75 was measured in the fine (PM2.5) aerosol fraction. No linear correlation was found between MBAS and LAS concentrations. At San Rossore site the variation of LAS concentrations was studied on a daily basis over a year. The LAS concentrations in the coarse fraction (PM10–2.5) were higher during strong sea storm conditions, characterized by strong air flow coming from the sea sector. These events, occurring with more intensity in winter, promoted the formation of primary marine aerosols containing LAS from the sea surface microlayer. In contrast to LAS, MBAS concentrations in the coarse fraction peaked in summer. Therefore, different sources are suggested for the two classes of compounds. In summer, increased MBAS concentration could be an indicator of phytoplanktonic blows enriching the sea surface microlayer with biogenic surfactants. In winter, some spikes in MBAS concentrations in the coarse fraction could be related to LAS concentrations and sea storm events. Moreover, in the fine fraction MBAS have a large concentration maxima in winter, corresponding to air masses coming from polluted continental areas. It is concluded that MBAS concentration in the fine or the coarse fraction is not an appropriate surrogate measurement of LAS concentration in aerosols because of the significant contribution from other sources to the MBAS concentration.","MBAS,PM2.5,Surfactants,PM10,LAS,Mediterranean coastal sites,"

Object detection is based on adaptive hysteresis thresholding of a saliency map generated with a modified version of the Boolean Map Saliency (BMS) approach. We show that the modification reduces false positives by suppressing detection of wakes and surface glint.

"maritime object detection based on yolox for aviation image","2022","Accurate detection of ships in maritime scenarios is conducive to improving transport efficiency and reducing the occurrence of maritime traffic accidents. However, ships under the drone perspective are small and have various scale variations, affecting the detection algorithms. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a maritime object detection method based on YOLOx. First, the ship data in the maritime scenario is processed and screened to form a self-built dataset. Then, the retrained YOLOx model is used to detect ships in maritime scenarios. Finally, on the self-built dataset, CenterNet, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4 are used to conduct a comparative experiment with this method. Through the results of the comparative experiments, it is found that the detection accuracy of YOLOx is the best, reaching 90.86%.

"morpho-bathymetric acoustic surveys as a tool for mapping traces of anthropogenic activities on the seafloor: the case study of the taranto area, southern italy","2022","In this study, an investigation procedure for mapping the traces of anthropogenic activities on the seafloor is proposed. Analyses are based on the interpretation of acoustic data (Multibeam Echosounder and Side Scan Sonar) acquired in the Taranto coastal area. Specific GIS tools supported the acoustic data analysis, interpretation, and mapping. These analyses highlighted that the seafloor of both coastal basins included in the investigated area is affected by a high distribution of traces related to different anthropogenic activities such as dredging, shipping, and mussel farming activities. Such kind of traces resulted efficiently detectable from morpho-bathymetric acoustic data. In particular, groove traces resulted highly distributed in both basins, while sunken mussel farm facilities are widely distributed in the Mar Grande basin. The results highlight as acoustic surveys represent a useful tool for orienting effective coastal management actions. This study points out how geophysical surveys support the geo-environmental characterization of highly urbanized coastal sectors.","Multibeam Echosounder,Contaminated coastal sites,Coastal geomorphology,Side Scan Sonar,Mar Grande,Mar Piccolo,"
"spaceborne radar imaging of maritime moving targets with the cosmo-skymed sar system","2014","Advanced satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, such as Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK), provide high-resolution images with reasonably short revisiting time, allowing for a number of applications in areas such as homeland security and maritime surveillance. Especially in the case of maritime surveillance, moving targets imaging represents a challenge for SAR systems as the complex target motions produce evident image defocusing. In this paper, we propose a complete processing chain that aims at detecting and imaging ship targets moving inside the imaged scene. In the proposed technique, moving targets are focused by using inverse SAR (ISAR) processing, which proves effective also in the case of target's complex motions. The implemented processing chain can be considered an innovative combination of well-established detection and ISAR imaging approaches. It is important to state that the proposed maritime ISAR mode for the CSK SAR system acts as an add-on system and, therefore, does not require any modification to the original CSK design. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by processing archive images acquired by CSK in spotlight mode; moreover results obtained by using CSK images acquired ad hoc against a cooperative target are also provided in order to prove the validity of the overall chain also in presence of targets with small size. As additional option of the proposed maritime ISAR it will also be shown that super-resolution techniques are applicable to targets affected by complex motions after ISAR processing is used.","spaceborne radar imaging,Marine vehicles,Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR),Cosmo-SkyMed SAR System,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,add-on system,Program processors,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),superresolution techniques,radar imaging,Image segmentation,Radar imaging,spaceborne radar,Imaging,Spaceborne radar,inverse SAR processing,remote sensing by radar,maritime moving targets,"
"a novel algorithm for detecting superpoints based on reversible virtual bitmaps","2019","A superpoint is a host, which makes a large number of connections to distinct nodes within a short time. The emergence of superpoint is often a sign of network attacks, such as DDoS attacks and port scanning. Timely detecting superpoints plays a crucial role in defending against network attacks. In this paper, we present an algorithm for detecting superpoints based on reversible virtual bitmaps. The proposed algorithm assigns four virtual bitmaps to each source for storing its related information. Moreover, six hash functions are designed carefully and skillfully, three of which may generate uniform outputs, the other three hash functions take a combination of some special substrings from the input as their outputs. Although the algorithm does not explicitly preserve any host address, it can reconstruct IP addresses by combining some specific substrings of function values. Furthermore, we make a validation on reconstructed IP addresses to filter out non-existing IP addresses and make some bit-AND operations on virtual bitmaps of each IP address to filter out the noise, improving the accuracy of our algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate our algorithm can achieve the same accuracy as or higher accuracy than other algorithms while reducing 50% of memory consumption compared with CSE (Compact Spread Estimator) and reducing 80% of memory consumption compared with VBF (Vector Bloom Filter).","Superpoint,Reversible virtual bitmaps,Network security,Host cardinality,"

"the promises and perils of automatic identification system data","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used to identify vessels in maritime navigation. Currently, it is used for various commercial purposes. However, the abundance and lack of quality of AIS data make it difficult to capitalize on its value. Therefore, an understanding of both the limitations of AIS data and the opportunities is important to maximize its value, but these have not been clearly stated in the existing literature. This study aims to help researchers and practitioners understand AIS data by identifying both the promises and perils of AIS data. We identify the different applications and limitations of AIS data in the literature and build upon them in a sequential mixed-design study. We first identify the promises and perils that exist in the literature. We then analyze AIS data from the port of Amsterdam quantitatively to detect noise and to find the perils researchers and practitioners could encounter. Our results incorporate quantitative findings with qualitative insights obtained from interviewing domain experts. This study extends the literature by considering multiple limitations of AIS data across different domains at the same time. Our results show that the amount of noise in AIS data depends on factors such as the equipment used, external factors, humans, dense traffic etc. The contribution that our paper makes is in combining and making a comprehensive list of both the promises and perils of AIS data. Consequently, this study helps researchers and practitioners to (i) identify the sources of noise, (ii) to reduce the noise in AIS data and (iii) use it for the benefits of their research or the optimization of their operations.","Ship behavior analysis,Advanced applications of AIS data,Navigation safety,Environmental evaluation,Data mining,AIS data,"
"changes in heat waves in chile","2018","This research aims to examine changes in heat waves (HWs) over Chile from 1961 to 2016 using daily maximum (TX) and minimum temperature (TN) data recorded at 13 weather stations. Based on three HW-definitions and five aspects for each definition some 15 indices were calculated and analyzed for the extended summer period (November-March). The three definitions of the HWs employed in this study were based on: (1) the TX exceeding the 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days, (2) the TN exceeding the 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days, and (3) the positive values of excess heat factor (EHF) maintaining for at least three consecutive days. The five aspects calculated for each of the definitions provided information related to the frequency, duration, and intensity of HWs. Trends (be them increasing or decreasing), magnitude (change per decade) and statistical significance (p < 0.05) were identified using the ordinary least square method and the t-test. Therefore, in terms of HW aspects, the results of the HWs climate regime analysis showed that the most extreme region of Chile is the Atacama Desert, followed by the Santiago metropolitan area. Change analysis revealed that Chile experienced increasing trends in most of the HW data sets. Thus, the frequency of trend types of all HW indices time series showed an increasing trend of 79%. About 24% of the time series showed statistically significant increasing trends. Decreasing trends were found in about 20% of the analyzed data, less than 1% of which being statistically significant. Stationary trends were detected in only 2% of the series. The highest frequency of statistically significant increasing trends was found in the HWs identified based on TX, followed by those computed based on EHF. Regarding their aspects, the number of events had the highest frequency of significant increasing trends. In terms of spatial distribution, the most important changes were found in central Chile.","Heat waves,Chile,Climate change,Excess heat factor,"
"maritime ship detection method for satellite images based on multiscale feature fusion","2023","Remote sensing ship recognition technology is one of the important research areas for achieving ocean security monitoring. However, maritime ship targets features such as multiscale, arbitrary direction, and dense arrangement, and their imaging is often influenced by factors such as sea fog and sea surface background. It is challenging for fast and accurate detection of remote sensing ships. We propose a new ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection (YOLO-RSSD) based on YOLOv5, which effectively improves the accuracy of ship detection while ensuring detection speed. It is attributed to our proposed four optimization measures in this model. First, the K-means++ algorithm is introduced in the data preprocessing part to improve the clustering effect and obtain candidate box sizes suitable for multiscale ship dataset. Then, an improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure is embedded in the feature fusion part to achieve cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion. Third, the original bounding box regression loss function is replaced with the EIoU loss, which is effective for accelerating the convergence and improving the regression accuracy of predicted boxes. Finally, a channel attention mechanism is introduced in the convolutional unit to enhance the model's ability to capture ship features. Experimental results show that the YOLO-RSSD model achieves a detection accuracy of 96.1% for remote sensing ships, which is 4.3% higher than the original YOLOv5 network. In addition, YOLO-RSSD performs good robustness and generalization ability. This means that our method has high practical value and provides a new solution for the analysis and application of remote sensing images.","detection speed,sea surface background,YOLO-RSSD model,Remote sensing,cross-layer multiscale weighted feature fusion,remote sensing,ship detection,Adaptively spatial feature fusion,Marine vehicles,ship features,multiscale ship dataset,Feature extraction,channel attention mechanism,improved bidirectional feature pyramid network structure,regression analysis,geophysical image processing,candidate box sizes,detection accuracy,Target recognition,Optical sensors,ships,original bounding box regression loss function,remote sensing ship recognition technology,Image recognition,remote sensing images,object detection,feature extraction,image classification,small target detection,optical satellite remote sensing image,ship detection algorithm YOLO-remote sensing ship detection,convolutional unit,YOLOv5,feature fusion part,convolutional neural nets,multiscale feature fusion,fast detection,arbitrary direction,Object detection,maritime ship detection method,sea fog,"
"inter-annual variability of net and gross ecosystem carbon fluxes: a review","2018","As the lifetime of regional flux networks approach twenty years, there is a growing number of papers that have published long term records (5 years or more) of net carbon fluxes between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Unanswered questions from this body of work are: 1) how variable are carbon fluxes on a year to year basis?; 2) what are the biophysical factors that may cause interannual variability and/or temporal trends in carbon fluxes?; and 3) how does the biophysical control on this carbon flux variability differ by climate and ecological spaces? To address these questions, we surveyed published data from 59 sites that reported on five or more years of continuous measurements, yielding 544 site-years of data. We found that the standard deviation of the interannual variability in net ecosystem carbon exchange (162gCm−2y−1) is large relative to its population mean (−200gCm−2 y−1). Broad-leaved evergreen forests and crops experienced the greatest absolute variability in interannual net carbon exchange (greater than ±300gCm−2y−1) and boreal evergreen forests and maritime wetlands were among the least variable (less than  ±40 gCm−2y−1). A disproportionate fraction of the yearly variability in net ecosystem exchange was associated with biophysical factors that modulated ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. Yet, there was appreciable and statistically significant covariance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Consequently, biophysical conditions that conspired to increase ecosystem photosynthesis to from one year to the next were associated with an increase in ecosystem respiration, and vice versa; on average, the year to year change in respiration was 40% as large as the year to year change in photosynthesis. The analysis also identified sets of ecosystems that are on the verge of switching from being carbon sinks to carbon sources. These include sites in the Arctic tundra, the evergreen forests in the Pacific northwest and some grasslands, where year to year changes in respiration are outpacing those in photosynthesis. While a select set of climatic and ecological factors (e.g. light, rainfall, temperature, phenology) played direct and indirect roles on this variability, their impact differed conditionally, as well as by climate and ecological spaces. For example, rainfall had both positive and negative effects. Deficient rainfall caused a physiological decline in photosynthesis in temperate and semi-arid regions. Too much rain, in the humid tropics, limited photosynthesis by limiting light. In peatlands and tundra, excess precipitation limited ecosystem respiration when it raised the water table to the surface. For deciduous forests, warmer temperatures lengthened the growing season, increasing photosynthesis, but this effect also increased soil respiration. Finally, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the detection limit of trends; we computed the confidence intervals of trends in multi-year carbon fluxes that need to be resolved to conclude whether the differences are to be attributed to randomness or biophysical forcings. Future studies and reports on interannual variations need to consider the role of the duration of the time series on random errors when quantifying potential trends and extreme events.","Eddy covariance,Net ecosystem exchange,Carbon cycle,FLUXNET,"

"anomaly based sea-surface small target detection using k-nearest neighbor classification","2020","Sea-surface small target detection is always a difficult problem in high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars for complex characteristics of sea clutter, weak target returns, and diversity of targets. Multiple features extracted from radar returns in different domains have ability but not enough to solely distinguish radar returns with target from sea clutter. Joint exploitation of multiple features becomes the key to improve detection performance. In this article, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and anomaly detection idea are cooperated to develop a novel sea-surface target detection method in the feature space spanned by the eight existing salient features. The detection is realized by the anomaly detection followed by a specially designed KNN-based classifier with a controllable false alarm rate. In the anomaly detection, a decision region is determined by the hyper-spherical coverage of the training set of sea clutter that is sufficient and ergodic in the feature space. The KNN-based classifier is designed based on the training sample set of sea clutter and the training sample set of simulated target returns plus sea clutter that is sufficient but nonergodic, by joint usage of feature weighting, neighbor weighting, and distance weighting. The novel method is validated by the two open and recognized IPIX and CSIR radar databases for sea-surface small target detection. The results show that it provides significant performance improvement in comparison with the existing multiple-feature-based detection methods, owing to the fact that the novel method avoids the dimension restriction and feature compression loss in the existing methods.","k-nearest neighbor algorithm,feature compression loss,IPIX radar databases,marine radar,high-resolution maritime ubiquitous radars,Anomaly detection,radar detection,radar clutter,KNN-based classifier design,anomaly based sea-surface,neighbor algorithm,Feature extraction,sea clutter,radar computing,anomaly detection idea,object detection,feature extraction,CSIR radar databases,weak target return simulation,K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with controllable false alarm rate,Radar clutter,feature weighting space,nearest neighbour methods,Training,sea-surface small target detection,Clutter,sea-surface target detection method,Object detection,Anomaly detection framework,multiple-feature-based detection methods,training sample set,Radar detection,"
"dltif: deep learning-driven cyber threat intelligence modeling and identification framework in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies.

The current state-of-the-art is based on deep segmentation networks trained on large datasets. Per-pixel ground truth labeling of such datasets, however, is labor-intensive and expensive. We observe that far less information is required for practical obstacle avoidance - the location of water edge on static obstacles like shore and approximate location and bounds of dynamic obstacles in the water is sufficient to plan a reaction. We propose a new scaffolding learning regime (SLR) that allows training obstacle detection segmentation networks only from such weak annotations, thus significantly reducing the cost of ground-truth labeling. Experiments show that maritime obstacle segmentation networks trained using SLR substantially outperform the same networks trained with dense ground truth labels, despite a significant reduction in labelling effort.

"radar detection of low-altitude targets in a maritime environment","1995","Results from a unique analytical and experimental effort to assess low-altitude, short-range, radar detection capabilities in an evaporation ducting environment are presented. Within the horizon, the duct may shift the location of the last interference null several kilometers in range, which may cause nondetection at ranges where detection is expected and detection at ranges where detection is not expected. In addition, the evaporation duct may reduce the signal strength at ranges near the last interference peak so that detection of low-altitude, small-size, targets may not be possible until the target is much closer. At ranges near and beyond the horizon, radar signal strength depends both on the surface layer and on the mixed layer. To accurately model propagation in this region, knowledge of both surface layer and upper air meteorology Is required. An empirical model to merge the surface layer with the mixed layer has been developed. Comparisons of measured to calculated detection range indicate that the assumption of a standard atmosphere minimizes the variance of the difference between the detection ranges whereas ranges calculated using the measured surface meteorological conditions and a modified surface layer model minimizes the median of the difference.<>","evaporation,surface layer,propagation,Ducts,radar detection,surface meteorological conditions,atmospheric boundary layer,signal strength,low-altitude targets,SHF,9415 MHz,Sea measurements,military systems,Meteorology,Atmospheric modeling,tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation,marine systems,X-band,microwave propagation,electromagnetic wave interference,Atmosphere,Oceans,atmospheric humidity,Sea surface,radar interference,Atmospheric measurements,radiofrequency interference,evaporation ducting environment,maritime environment,mixed layer,small-size targets,short-range radar detection,horizon,Interference,last interference null,Radar detection,"

"trial results conducted by multiple canadian government agencies of the recent covert technology developped by tektrap to trace and track the integrity of maritime containers worldwide","2012","iCargo is an easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device combining GPS and door lock tracking with wireless and satellite communications to remotely track the status and position of maritime containers worldwide. A system of strategically placed readers combined with satellite or cellular communications and redundant technologies ensures that security breaches are detected early and reliably anywhere along the supply chain. iCargo provides a GPS trace of where a container has travelled and where the container might have been opened. Deviations from the expected itinerary in time and/or distance are detected and the container can be flagged for physical inspection. Such a system helps borders authorities to focus their energy on suspicious cargo with the overall impact of speeding the flow of all cargo. iCargo uses a patented technique to convert the metal structure of the container into an antenna thereby allowing it to be installed behind the rubber seal of the door in a truly covert fashion. Other technologies are visible from the exterior and vulnerable to tampering and damage during container handling. The location within the door gasket is ideal for monitoring the door open/close status as well as for acting as a communications gateway to optional internal sensors. There are approximately 7 million maritime containers entering/leaving North America every year. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. Such containers may include contraband, hazmats, weapons or illegal items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements since Sept-11th, only 5% of the maritime containers go through physical inspection. The use of the iCargo mounted on a container at the point of departure will assist government authorities in making better decisions about which containers to inspect thereby speeding up the overall throughput of all containers. In today's lean economy, goods in transit do not contribute to economic growth but instead are added costs to customers and shippers. With rising fuel and transportation costs, delays at borders are becoming increasingly expensive. Early detection via the iCargo system will help to reduce these costs by not only helping to shorten inspection delays but by also allowing officials to focus their energy on suspicious cargo thereby improving border security. Tektrap has been selected for the Pool of Pre-qualified Proposals for the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP). CICP is a very competitive program that targets recent innovations, especially in the field of national security, which are ready for the beta phase of product development. Within this award, iCargo will be evaluated during spring and early summer 2012 by Canada Border Services Agency for Canadian-US border application, by Defense Research and Development Canada, DND, for land, rail and air applications in the Canada Nordic environment, and by Transport Canada for trans-Canada land/rail and Asia-Canada sea conditions. In addition to presenting the results of these multiple trial results, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VHF, cellular, satellite, GPS and Wifi antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add any external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","Satellites,Security,trial results,Monitoring,Global Positioning System,damage,maritime containers,communications gateway,inspection,cellular communications,satellite communication,iCargo,Containers,physical inspection,door lock tracking,optional internal sensors,maritime containers worldwide,Tektrap,Maritime container intrusion sensor and Active RFID,wireless communications,containers,supply chain,GPS,government,easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device,Frequency modulation,satellite communications,door gasket,multiple Canadian government agencies,Energy harvesting,Maritime container traceability,container handling,tampering,"
"airborne moving target indication of ground and maritime targets with smartradar","2014","SmartRadar is a multi-channel radar technology demonstrator aimed for airborne and spaceborne ground surveillance and reconnaissance applications. SmartRadar (an acronym for Scalable Multipurpose Aerospace Radar Technology) is engineered by Airbus Defence and Space. An X-Band variant of SmartRadar applying a multi-channel active electronically scanned array antenna (AESA) was integrated into a wing mounted pod and EASA certified for world-wide operation on a Lear Jet 35 aircraft. Due to its flexible design SmartRadar allows the development and demonstration of various state of the art advanced radar modes such as imaging by means of High Resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), or target detection by means of Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI). Also Maritime Surveillance modes and target tracking are available. Already in 2011 the on-board processing of high resolution SAR images in near real-time was demonstrated. In 2012 and 2013 the space-time-adaptive processing (STAP) of three channel GMTI data in real-time and on-board the pod was shown successfully in several flight campaigns. Recently also the detection of maritime moving targets became a customer demanded mode. One of these modes is the so called Maritime MTI (MMTI) mode which is the equivalent of the GMTI mode, i.e. coherent processing and clutter suppression by means of STAP is applied. This paper gives some insight into the GMTI/MMTI mode and STAP processing relevant issues. Results of the flight trials in 2013 emphasize the sensor's capabilities. The SmartRadar Pod System is property of the German MOD (BAAINBw).

"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"

"microwave wireless coordination technologies for coherent distributed maritime radar","2017","Developments in communications and networking have enabled separate microwave wireless systems to coordinate at increasingly detailed levels, creating a path towards distributed wireless systems. Coherent distributed arrays, where the individual wireless systems synchronize at the level of the RF carrier phase, achieve transmit power gains on the order of the number of platforms squared, and receive gains proportional to the number of platforms. For radar applications, an array with N elements yields an overall system gain of N3 in the far field of the array, providing a significant improvement in radar sensitivity. This paper analyzes improved detection capabilities for surface maritime radars operating coherently, and discusses technologies for achieving coherent gain.

"towards a framework of key technologies for drones","2020","The potential applications for drones, especially those in manned areas or into non-segregated airspace, are currently not possible without the development and validation of certain key enabling technologies: “detect and avoid”, “air traffic management”, “command and control (C2) link”, and “security and cyber resilience”. This issue has a high impact on European innovation as identified by SESAR JU and demands R&D investments and incentives for the convergence of shared technologies and markets. In this paper, we discuss the vision of COMP4DRONES project to complement SESAR JU efforts with a particular focus on safe software and hardware drone architectures. COMP4DRONES will bear a holistically designed ecosystem ranging from application to electronic components. The ecosystem aims at supporting (1) efficient customization and incremental assurance of drone-embedded platforms, (2) safe autonomous decision making concerning individual or cooperative missions, (3) trustworthy drone-to-drone and drone-to- ground communications even in presence of malicious attackers and under the intrinsic platform constraints, and (4) agile and cost-effective design and assurance of drone modules and systems. Lead applications driving ecosystem development and benchmarking on the fields of transport, inspection, logistic, precision agriculture, and parcel delivery will be produced.","Autonomy,Automation and Control Systems,Composition,Safety,Drones,Security,Interoperability,"
"advection pathways at the mt. cimone wmo-gaw station: seasonality, trends, and influence on atmospheric composition","2020","Relationships are analysed between advection pathways and atmospheric composition at the high-mountain station of Mt. Cimone (Italy), between 1998 and 2011. Back-trajectory cluster analysis identifies eight main advection pathways. A connection is demonstrated between the seasonality of airmass transport and atmospheric composition. Temporal trends and correlation of variables, flow types and teleconnection indices show, among other, decreasing trends of 210Pb (a radionuclide of crustal origin; −0.008 mBq m−3 year−1) as well as PM10 (−0.15 μg m−3 year−1), indicating that previously observed downward PM10 trends in Europe may actually be attributable to a combination of meteorological factors and decreasing anthropogenic emissions. The detection of a positive (negative) correlation of these tracers with Western (Arctic) air masses, showing significant downward (upward) trends at the study site, further confirms our findings. Lastly, relationships between teleconnection indices and atmospheric transport types/atmospheric variables are further analysed, focusing on large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and regional low-frequency atmospheric circulation pathways, the Mediterranean Oscillation and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation. The analysis reveals the important influence of such regional indices on the advection pathways.","Atmospheric radiotracers,Aerosol,Back-trajectories,Teleconnection,Trends,"

History shows us that any collision involving a marine craft can have a devastating effect both on human life and the environment. Presented here is a method for the statistical characterization of the sea present in an image and the subsequent segmentation of the image into two regions, sea and object. The characterization process uses statistical measures on histogram data collected from various regions of the image. This leads to a characteristic grey-level range that represents the 'sea'. The grey-level statistics are then used to segment the image into regions that contain sea. The methods introduced here have been shown to work well with images containing differing sized objects with differing sea conditions and levels of illumination.","imaging system,image recognition,human life,Marine vehicles,Road accidents,maritime vessels,grey-level statistics,History,statistical analysis,maritime image segmentation,marine craft,Optical reflection,ships,Containers,illumination level,Humans,object detection,Image segmentation,Histograms,Radar imaging,image segmentation,collision avoidance,Videoconference,histogram data analysis,sea statistical characterization,"
"an early onset of enso influence in the extra-tropics of the southwest pacific inferred from a 14, 600 year high resolution multi-proxy record from paddy's lake, northwest tasmania","2017","Tropical El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an important influence on natural systems and cultural change across the Pacific Ocean basin. El Niño events result in negative moisture anomalies in the southwest Pacific and are implicated in droughts and catastrophic wildfires across eastern Australia. An amplification of tropical El Niño activity is reported in the east Pacific after ca. 6.7 ka; however, proxy data for ENSO-driven environmental change in Australia suggest an initial influence only after ca. 5 ka. Here, we reconstruct changes in vegetation, fire activity and catchment dynamics (e.g. erosion) over the last 14.6 ka from part of the southwest Pacific in which ENSO is the main control of interannual hydroclimatic variability: Paddy's Lake, in northwest Tasmania (1065 masl), Australia. Our multi-proxy approach includes analyses of charcoal, pollen, geochemistry and radioactive isotopes. Our results reveal a high sensitivity of the local and regional vegetation to climatic change, with an increase of non-arboreal pollen between ca. 14.6–13.3 ka synchronous with the Antarctic Cold Reversal, and a sensitivity of the local vegetation and fire activity to ENSO variability recorded in the tropical east Pacific through the Holocene. We detect local-scale shifts in vegetation, fire and sediment geochemistry at ca. 6.3, 4.8 and 3.4 ka, simultaneous with increases in El Niño activity in the tropical Pacific. Finally, we observe a fire-driven shift in vegetation from a pyrophobic association dominated by rainforest elements to a pyrogenic association dominated by sclerophyllous taxa following a prolonged (>1 ka) phase of tropical ENSO-amplification and a major local fire event at ca. 3.4 ka. Our results reveal the following key insights: (1) that ENSO has been a persistent modulator of southwest Pacific climate and fire activity through the Holocene; (2) that the climate of northwest Tasmania is sensitive to long-term shifts in tropical ENSO variability; and (3) that there has been possible stationarity in the spatial influence of ENSO over this region through the Holocene.","Australia,Pollen,El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO),South-west Pacific,Palaeoecology,Geochemistry,Tasmania,Fire,"
"centennial glacier retreat increases sedimentation and eutrophication in subantarctic periglacial lakes: a study case of lake uruguay","2021","High resolution XRF scanning documented inter-annual paleolimnological changes of a Subantarctic periglacial lake, during a process of centennial glacier retreat in King George Island, Antarctica. Two major paleoenvironmental stages were inferred from the combined analysis of elemental, molecular and isotopic biomarkers, with a boundary or transition set at about 3200 yr BP. The first stage was characterized by a relatively low allochthonous organic content, reduced productivity and nitrogen levels. Such paleoenvironmental conditions are interpreted as a terrestrial system under periglacial influence, where material influx was related to erosion process from the melt water discharge, because of the proximity to the Collins Glacier ice cap. After the major Holocene glacier advance dated at about 3500 yr BP, the ice cap retreat led to the formation of Lake Uruguay, which involved in filling processes leading to moraine deposits, proglacial meltwater channels, and lakes next to the land glacier. During the second stage, with the onset of the Current Warm Period, prior to 1900 CE the stabilization of the Zr/Rb ratio within the laminated sediments documented the origin of the lacustrine sedimentation system, with subsequent increases in the sedimentation rate and biomass content (total nitrogen and organic carbon). Time series analyses revealed that the lake displayed variability cycles related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as reflected by high resolution sedimentological proxies for grain size, weathering, allochthonous inputs from the watershed, increase of biomass and productivity, and changes in redox conditions, all of which displayed similar oscillation cycles from 2 to 6 yr. During this periglacial recession and associated eutrophication process, we detected a striking loss in both bacterial specific richness and diversity as inferred from preliminary selected ancient DNA analyses. Thus, the Antarctic warming scenario leading to glacier depletion appears to exert deterioration consequences on the Subantarctic microbial web.","Lipid biomarkers,Paleolimnology,Ancient DNA,Antarctica,XRF-scanning,"

"volcanic and tectonic features of shirahama bank in the northern ryukyu arc: implications for cross-arc volcanism controlled by arc-parallel extension","2021","This paper presents volcanic and tectonic features of Shirahama Bank, an unexplored shallow submarine edifice in the northern Ryukyu Arc which was previously poorly mapped, and consequently the nature of its volcanism and tectonism have been poorly understood. New high-resolution (5 m) bathymetry revealed that Shirahama Bank has small volcanic edifices and depressions on its flat top with water depths of 60–150 m. The edifices have pointy summits with steep slopes greater than 30°. Within the depressions, a total of 59 acoustic bubble plumes were detected by shipboard multibeam sonar, suggesting that active volcanic degassing occurs in this region. The bank is dissected entirely by NW–SE to WNW–ESE trending lineaments while the volcanic edifices and depressions on the flat top are undissected. Shirahama Bank was formed by multiple-stages of volcanism. The youngest volcanic stage probably occurred after surface erosion by sea-level low-stand during the late Pleistocene and after tectonic deformation, providing a constraint on the timing of Quaternary volcanism in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Structural control of arc volcanism in the area is observed. The NW–SE to WNW–ESE lineaments identified on and around Shirahama Bank are interpreted as normal faults and form cross-arc graben structures. The young volcanic structures and active bubble plumes at Shirahama Bank and surrounding areas are concentrated within these cross-arc grabens, suggesting that the most recent volcanism is controlled by ~NE–SW extension (arc-parallel or along-arc extension) in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Our results, combined with previous studies, suggest that arc-parallel extension, which differs from the previously known back-arc extension in the Okinawa Trough, plays an important role in arc volcanism during its initial stages.","Ryukyu Arc,Bubble plume,Arc-parallel extension,Cross-arc volcanism,"
"detecting and hunting cyberthreats in a maritime environment: specification and experimentation of a maritime cybersecurity operations centre","2018","The vast majority of worldwide goods exchanges are made by sea. In some parts of the world, the concurrence for dominance at sea is very high and definitely seen as a main military goal. Meanwhile, new generation ships highly rely on information systems for communication, navigation and platform management. This ever-spreading attack surface and permanent satellite links have grown a concern about the potential impact of cyberattacks on a ship at sea or on naval shore infrastructures. Therefore, on top of the usual cyberprotection measures taken for safety reasons, it is essential to implement an ongoing cyber monitoring of ships in order to detect, react accordingly, and stop any incoming threat. In this paper, we explain the specific constraints when trying to assess the cyber situation awareness of maritime information systems. As we will demonstrate, those systems combine physical and logical constraints which complexify their cyber monitoring process and architecture. Gathering valuable data while having a limited and controlled impact on the satellite bandwidth, maintaining a high level of integrity on remote systems in production are, for instance, thriving challenges for both civilian and military ships. We have designed and set up a research platform which fulfils those specifications to streamline the cyber monitoring process.

"patterns of fire activity over indonesia and malaysia from polar and geostationary satellite observations","2013","Biomass burning patterns over the Maritime Continent of Southeast Asia are examined using a new active fire detection product based on application of the Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF_ABBA) to data from the imagers on the MTSAT geostationary satellites operated by the Japanese space agency JAXA. Data from MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2 covering 34months from September 2008 to July 2011 are examined for a study region consisting of Indonesia, Malaysia, and nearby environs. The spatial and temporal distributions of fires detected in the MTSAT WF_ABBA product are described and compared with active fire observations from MODIS MOD14 data. Land cover distributions for the two instruments are examined using a new 250m land cover product from the National University of Singapore. The two products show broadly similar patterns of fire activity, land cover distribution of fires, and pixel fire radiative power (FRP). However, the MTSAT WF_ABBA data differ from MOD14 in important ways. Relative to MODIS, the MTSAT WF_ABBA product has lower overall detection efficiency, but more fires detected due to more frequent looks, a greater relative fraction of fires in forest and a lower relative fraction of fires in open areas, and significantly higher single-pixel retrieved FRP. The differences in land cover distribution and FRP between the MTSAT and MODIS products are shown to be qualitatively consistent with expectations based on pixel size and diurnal sampling. The MTSAT WF_ABBA data are used to calculate coverage-corrected diurnal cycles of fire for different regions within the study area. These diurnal cycles are preliminary but demonstrate that the fraction of diurnal fire activity sampled by the two MODIS sensors varies significantly by region and vegetation type. Based on the results from comparison of the two fire products, a series of steps is outlined to account for some of the systematic biases in each of these satellite products in order to produce a successful merged fire detection product.","Remote sensing,Smoke,Biomass burning,Fire,"
"influence of atmospheric modeling on spectral target detection through forward modeling approach in multi-platform remote sensing data","2022","Identifying objects or pixels of interest that are few in numbers and sparsely populated in imagery is referred to as target detection. Traditionally, the inverse modeling (IM) approach, usually a slow and computationally intensive process, is used for detecting targets using surface reflectance spectra. For the emerging online methods in remote sensing, modeling the at-sensor radiance of target material, i.e., a forward modeling (FM) approach, can be used. Compared to the IM approach, FM is better suited to online methods due to its potential for adaptation to regional atmospheric modeling. Spectral knowledge transfer of a target from a known to an unknown atmospheric condition is the primary outcome of an efficient target detection framework. However, such an endeavor requires an exhaustive assessment of the target detection process under different atmospheric models and associated uncertainties. The objective of this work is to assess the quantitative impact of atmospheric parameters on the detectability of engineered targets. Specifically, the impact of critical atmospheric parameters such as aerosol optical thickness (AOT), standard atmospheric profiles, and aerosol models are considered. For this effect, we designed a multi-platform image acquisition setup that acquired targets concurrently using a ground-based terrestrial hyperspectral imager (THI), an airborne hyperspectral imager (AVIRIS-NG), and a space-borne multispectral imager (Sentinel-2). We used a point-based spectroradiometer and pixel-based THI to collect the in-situ reference target reflectance spectra and generated a radiance spectral library by simulating TOA radiance spectra using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. We have considered two cases of target radiance simulations, i.e., (i) corresponding to a grid of different AOT values for a predefined atmospheric and aerosol profile, and (ii) corresponding to varying combinations of atmospheric and aerosol profiles at a given AOT. The detection has been carried out using multiple target detection algorithms. Results indicate that the spectral knowledge-based targets can be detected in remote sensing data under different atmospheric model scenarios using the FM approach. A detection rate of about 75% and 50% have been consistently obtained for remote sensing data from airborne and space-borne platforms with a false alarm (FA) rate of 10-2 to 10-3 respectively. Change in the AOT across atmospheric models has resulted in decision-changing implications in the target detection modeling. The selection of the wrong atmospheric profile can potentially aggravate the number of FAs produced by a particular detection algorithm.","Multi-platform dataset,Radiative transfer,Atmospheric profiles,Aerosol optical thickness,Aerosol models,Target detection,"

"diapycnal diffusivity in the core and oxycline of the tropical north atlantic oxygen minimum zone","2016","Diapycnal diffusivity estimates from two Tracer Release Experiments (TREs) and microstructure measurements in the oxycline and core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) are compared. For the first time, two TREs within the same area at different depths were realized: the Guinea Upwelling Tracer Release Experiment (GUTRE) initiated in 2008 in the oxycline at approximately 320m depth, and the Oxygen Supply Tracer Release Experiment (OSTRE) initiated in 2012 in the core of the OMZ at approximately 410m depth. The mean diapycnal diffusivity Dz was found to be insignificantly smaller in the OMZ core with (1.06±0.24)×10−5m2s−1 compared to (1.11±0.22)×10−5m2s−1 90m shallower in the oxycline. Unexpectedly, GUTRE tracer was detected during two of the OSTRE surveys which showed that the estimated diapycnal diffusivity from GUTRE over a time period of seven years was within the uncertainty of the previous estimates over a time period of three years. The results are consistent with the Dz estimates from microstructure measurements and demonstrate that Dz does not vary significantly vertically in the OMZ within the depth range of 200–600m and does not change with time. The presence of a seamount chain in the vicinity of the GUTRE injection region did not cause enhanced Dz compared to the smoother bottom topography of the OSTRE injection region, although the analysis of vertical shear spectra from ship ADCP data showed elevated internal wave energy level in the seamount vicinity. However, the two tracer patches covered increasingly overlapping areas with time and thus spatially integrated increasingly similar fields of local diffusivity, as well as the difference in local stratification counteracted the influence of roughness on Dz. For both experiments no significant vertical displacements of the tracer were observed, thus diapycnal upwelling within the ETNA OMZ is below the uncertainty level of 5myr−1.","Tropical Atlantic,Guinea Dome,Tracers,Diffusion coefficients,Upwelling,Oxygen minimum zone,Ventilation,"

Different calibration or channel balancing strategies, on the basis of the digital balancing (DB) method, are studied, considering their impact on SAR-GMTI performance. An adaptive SAR processor, accounting for target kinematics and based on a matched filter bank (MFB) approach, is integrated in the SAR-GMTI processing chain in order to retrieve refocused images of the moving vessels.","surveillance,state-of-the-art airborne SAR,Interferometry,remote sensing by radar,matched filter bank,ship detection,multichannel GMTI data,F-SAR sensor,displaced phase center antenna (DPCA),monitoring,German Aerospace Center,Synthetic aperture radar,maritime scenarios,ground moving target indication,ground moving target indication (GMTI),spatially variant apodization (SVA),synthetic aperture radars,classical dual channel GMTI techniques,imaging space-time adaptive processing,extended DPCA (EDPCA),promising adaptive techniques,pioneering SAR sensors,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,along-track interferometry,displaced phase center antenna,state-of-the-art spaceborne SAR,SAR-GMTI processing chain,TerraSAR-X sensor,digital balancing (DB),digital balancing method,constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector,Clutter,Object detection,Sensors,Surveillance,Spaceborne radar,multichannel SAR-GMTI,adaptive SAR processor,SAR-GMTI performance,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Along-track interferometry (ATI),oceanographic techniques,"

"an enhanced lightweight convolutional neural network for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2022","With the extensive application of artificial intelligence, ship detection from optical satellite remote sensing images using deep learning technology can significantly improve detection accuracy. However, the existing methods usually have complex models and huge computations, which makes them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices, such as satellites. To solve this problem, this article proposes an enhanced lightweight ship detection model called ShipDetectionNet to replace the standard convolution with improved convolution units. The improved convolution unit is implemented by applying depthwise separable convolution to replace standard convolution and further using the pointwise group convolution to replace the point convolution in depthwise separable convolution. In addition, the attention mechanism is incorporated into the convolution unit to ensure detection accuracy. Compared to the latest YOLOv5s, our model has a comparable performance in mean average precision, while the number of parameters and the model size are reduced by 14.18% and 13.14%, respectively. Compared to five different lightweight detection models, the proposed ShipDetectionNet is more competent for ship detection tasks. In addition, the ShipDetectionNet is evaluated on four challenging scenarios, demonstrating its generalizability and effectiveness.","depthwise separable convolution,Satellites,Optical imaging,Remote sensing,deep learning (artificial intelligence),ship detection,maritime surveillance system,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,depthwise separable convolution (DS-Conv),Optical sensors,deep learning,ships,ShipDetectionNet,pointwise group convolution,object detection,optical satellite remote sensing image,convolutional neural network,Convolution,convolutional neural nets,marine engineering computing,optical satellite remote,Attention mechanism,pointwise group convolution (G-Conv),artificial intelligence,"
"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"

"unseen annihilation: illegal fishing practices and nautical patrol","2023","A host of regulations should protect fish, a common-pool resource, from overexploitation, but detecting violations of these regulations is challenging, both at sea and in port. We present a novel approach to uncover a supposedly widespread and particularly harmful illegal fishing practice, the use of nets with illegally small mesh size. Our approach relies on readily available data on reported fish landings. We focus on bottom trawling, the world’s most widely used fishing method. We exploit the fact that using illegally small mesh size increases the share of small fish in the catch. Using quasi-random variation in nautical patrol as a source of variation in the incentive to comply, we show that in weeks without patrol the share of small fish in the landed catch is systematically larger than in adjacent weeks with patrol. Our results are in line with widespread use of illegally small mesh. The resulting catch and discard of juvenile fish is many times larger than the gain in the catch of marketable fish. This harm has thus far been largely ignored in estimates of the externalities from fishing.","Environmental economics,Fisheries,Enforcement,Regulation,"

Conversely, geoinformatics methodologies are seldom used. To address this gap, we examined the prevalence of happy facial expressions (HFE) in natural settings such as water bodies, green vegetation, and undeveloped areas. We applied a novel, spatio-temporal analysis of photos taken in the Boston area and posted on Flickr – a location-based social network – during 2012–2015 (N = 60,013). Photos were analyzed using Microsoft Emotion API to detect facial expressions. ETN, measured either as a composite score, or based on the three aforementioned aspects, was significantly associated with HFEs, even after controlling for temporal patterns. An exploratory visualization of spatial clusters characterized by high HFE proportion was in agreement with the statistical results.

"a real-time data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery","2022","While maritime transportation is the primary means of long-haul transportation of goods to and from the EU, it continues to present a significant number of casualties and fatalities owing to damage to ship equipment; damage attributed to machinery failures during daily ship operations. Therefore, the implementation of state-of-the-art inspection and maintenance activities are of paramount importance to adequately ensure the proper functioning of systems. Accordingly, Internet of Ships paradigm has emerged to guarantee the interconnectivity of maritime objects. Such technology is still in its infancy, and thus several challenges need to be addressed. An example of which is data preparation, critical to ensure data quality while avoiding biased results in further analysis to enhance transportation operations. As part of developing a real-time intelligent system to assist with instant decision-making strategies that enhance ship and systems availability, operability, and profitability, a data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery based on image generation and connected component analysis is proposed. The identification of such states is of preeminent importance, as non-operational states may adversely alter the results outlined. A case study of three diesel generators of a tanker ship is introduced to validate the developed framework. Results of this study demonstrated the outperformance of the proposed model in relation to the widely implemented clustering models k-means and GMMs with EM algorithm. As such, the proposed framework can adequately identify steady states appropriately to guarantee the detection of such states in real-time, whilst ensuring computational efficiency and model effectiveness.","Marine machinery,Maritime transportation,Connected component analysis,Smart maintenance,Markov chains,Steady states identification,"

"hybrid bernoulli filtering for detection and tracking of anomalous path deviations","2018","This paper presents a solution to the problem of sequential joint anomaly detection and tracking of a target subject to switching unknown path deviations. Based on a dynamic model described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes, the anomaly is represented by a target (e.g., a marine vessel) that deviates from a preset route by changing its nominal mean velocity. The Random Finite Set (RFS) framework is used to represent the switching nature of target's anomalous behavior in the presence of spurious measurements and detection uncertainty. Combining these two ingredients, the problem of jointly detecting target's path deviations and estimating its kinematic state can be formulated within the Bayesian framework, and analytically solved by means of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that sequentially updates the joint posterior density of the unknown OU velocity input (a Bernoulli RFS) and of the target's state random vector. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter, implemented in Gaussian-mixture form, in a simulated scenario of vessel tracking for maritime traffic monitoring.","Anomaly detection,switching nature,state random vector,Sea measurements,Stochastic processes,Radio frequency,vessel tracking,hybrid Bernoulli filtering,target tracking,Random Finite Set framework,stochastic processes,filtering theory,hybrid Bernoulli filter,Target tracking,object detection,Gaussian processes,Bayesian framework,Artificial intelligence,anomalous path deviations,unknown OU velocity input,nominal mean velocity,Surveillance,marine vessel,joint posterior density,sequential joint anomaly detection,"
"11 developing a basis for detecting and predicting long-term ecosystem changes","2006","Long-term ecosystem changes in the Benguela region include species alternations and regime shifts, which are sometimes obscured by large intra- and inter- annual variability in the ecosystem. This chapter proposes that no single model or approach can resolve this variability and effectively detect and predict long-term ecosystem changes; a coherent, robust, transparent and reproducible synthesis framework is required. Indicators and models are described that can be used to identify some aspects of the current state of ecosystem structure and to detect and monitor long-term change. A short-term challenge is to synthesize these varied sources of multidisciplinary (and sometimes contradictory) information in a logical and consistent fashion. An expert system approach is proposed to do this, consolidating results of different indicators and models within a dynamic process that uses feedbacks to validate predictions of the expert system, and to improve it. It is suggested that such an approach should be initiated in the short term, even as models and indicators are being developed further. In parallel, multivariate statistical tools should be refined and applied to existing time series, to identify past periods of ecosystem change. Current data gaps should be filled, including time series of primary production and the abundance of gelatinous zooplankton. In the medium term, the expert system model should evolve to a point where its results can be used to inform various management groups about the state of the ecosystem. Part of this evolution requires that ecosystem indicators be presented with error estimates or formal assessments of quality.",""
"hybrid graph convolution neural network and branch-and-bound optimization for traffic flow forecasting","2023","In this study, we combine graph optimization and prediction in a single pipeline to investigate an innovative convolutional graph-based neural network for urban traffic flow prediction in an edge IoT environment. Pre-processing of the linked graph is first performed to remove noise from the set of original road networks of urban traffic data. Outlier detection strategy is used to efficiently explore the road network and remove irrelevant patterns and noise. The resulting graph is then implemented to train an extended graph convolutional neural network to estimate the traffic flow in the city. To accurately tune the hyperparameter values of the proposed framework, a new optimization technique is developed based on branch and bound. For comparison, an intensive evaluation is conducted with multiple datasets and baseline methods. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baseline solutions, especially when the number of nodes in the graph is large.","Forecasting,Deep learning,Graph convolution neural network,Smart roads,"
"global change and the measurement of absolute sea-level","1987","To quantify properly the long-term response of sea-level to climate change, land motions must be separated from the apparent or relative sea-level change recorded by conventional tide/sea-level gauges. Here we present a concept for global measurement of the true or “absolute” sea-level change, which combines recent advances in space-based geodetic techniques with plans for a global sea-level network under the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Data from initial feasibility tests show that land motion, due to global (plate tectonic), regional (glacial rebound), or local (fluid withdrawal) effects, can probably be measured to ±1cm (on a single measurement basis) by an innovative combination of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) tevhniques. By making repeated observations of position at a number of tide gauges using portable, economical GPS receivers in a differential mode relative to the fewer, more stable, but more expensive VLBI observatories, it will be possible to subtract land motion from the relative sea-level signal. Decadal to century scale trends at the 1–2mm y−1 level will be resolvable in the sea-level and vertical land motion time series within about a decade. Detection of subsidence or uplift at specific gauges will allow correction for land motion or deletion of bad data when computing regional or global, i.e. eustatic, sea-level changes. In addition to their applications in oceanography and climate studies, such data will test models by Peltier and other that relate mantle viscosity and deglaciation history to present rates of crustal subsidence or uplift. If the predicted crustal motions are confirmed, we can also have more confidence in the use of historical tide/sea-level gauge records in retrospective studies of sea-level change related to climate variability on decadal or longer time scales. It is concluded that as few as one-third (about 100) of the total number of tide/sea-level gauges (250–300) required for global climate research programmes (WYRTKI and PUGH, 1984) need to be upgraded to “sea-level observatory” status, in terms of sensors and geodetic control, to build a two tier sea-level network that will provide the data needed to solve many problems of both relative and absolute sea-level change. Such a network will provide basic information supporting research on a wide range of questions related to “global change”.",""
"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FedBatch.","Maritime Transportation System,CNN-MLP based model,computer network security,federated learning process,IoT,Collaborative work,deep learning (artificial intelligence),serious cyber security threats,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,cloud,security of data,multifarious cyber-attacks,privacy preservation,Maritime Transportation systems,deep learning,Servers,lightweight local model,model training local,Data models,massive data,network intrusion,voyage,edge computing,federated learning,IoT-based MTS,adaptive aggregation method,multilayer perceptrons,convolutional neural nets,model parameters,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Intrusion detection,Intrusion Detection System,named Batch Federated Aggregation,IoT devices,learning (artificial intelligence),data privacy,global model,"

"nonambiguous sar image formation of maritime targets using weighted sparse approach","2018","For a single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR), finite-pulse repetition frequency and nonideal antenna pattern cause azimuth ambiguities, i.e., ghosts in image domain. In this paper, a novel algorithm of locating processing weighted group lasso SAR image formation for maritime targets is proposed to effectively mitigate the ambiguities, which can work on a single-look complex SAR image. In the scheme, the ambiguous signal model using the conventional SAR focusing processor is first explicitly derived, showing the analytical expression of SAR image formulation. The weighted sparse group lasso algorithm is then employed to group-sparsely reconstruct the subimages of nonambiguous and ambiguous Doppler components. In particular, we introduce adaptively weighted sparsity constraint, obtained from a priori azimuth antenna pattern, and clutter clustering during sparse imaging. It should be emphasized that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the azimuth resolution by coherently integrating the ambiguous signal components, which greatly helps the target detection and recognition in maritime surveillance.

"large area monitoring with a modis-based disturbance index (di) sensitive to annual and seasonal variations","2009","Disturbance of the vegetated land surface, due to factors such as fire, insect infestation, windthrow and harvesting, is a fundamental driver of the composition forested landscapes with information on disturbance providing critical insights into species composition, vegetation condition and structure. Long-term climate variability is expected to lead to increases in both the magnitude and distribution of disturbances. As a consequence it is important to develop monitoring systems to better understand these changes in the terrestrial biosphere as well to inform managers about disturbance agents more typically captured through specific monitoring programs (such as focused on insect, fire, or agricultural conditions). Changes in the condition, composition and distribution pattern of vegetation can lead to changes in the spectral and thermal signature of the land surface. Using a 6-year time series of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data we apply a previously proposed Disturbance Index (DI) which has been shown to be sensitive to both continuous and discontinuous change. Using Canada as an example area, we demonstrate the capacity of this Disturbance Index to monitor land dynamics over time. As expected, our results confirm a significant relationship between area flagged as disturbed by the index and area burnt as estimated from other satellite sources (R2=0.78, p<0.0001). The DI also demonstrates a sensitivity to capture and depict changes related to insect infestations. Further, on a regional basis the DI produces change information matching measured wide-area moisture conditions (i.e., drought) and corresponding agricultural outputs. These findings indicate that for monitoring a large area, such as Canada, the time series based DI is a useful tool to aid in change detection and national monitoring activities.","Insect,Disturbance,Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI),Land Surface Temperature (LST),Drought,Coarse spatial resolution,Disturbance Index (DI),MODIS,Fire,"
"a novel anomaly detection approach to identify intentional ais on-off switching","2017","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a ship reporting system based on messages broadcast by vessels carrying an AIS transponder. The recent increase of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of receivers is making AIS one of the main sources of information for Maritime Situational Awareness activities. Nevertheless, AIS is subject to reliability and manipulation issues; indeed, the received reports can be unintentionally incorrect, jammed or deliberately spoofed. Moreover, the system can be switched off to cover illicit operations, causing the interruption of AIS reception. This paper addresses the problem of detecting whether a shortage of AIS messages represents an alerting situation or not, by exploiting the Received Signal Strength Indicator available at the AIS Base Stations (BS). In designing such an anomaly detector, the electromagnetic propagation conditions that characterize the channel between ship AIS transponders and BS have to be taken into consideration. The first part of this work is thus focused on the experimental investigation and characterisation of coverage patterns extracted from the real historical AIS data. In addition, the paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm to identify intentional AIS on-off switching. The presented methodology is then illustrated and assessed on a real-world dataset.","Maritime surveillance,Automatic Identification System (AIS),Anomaly detection,Knowledge-based systems,Maritime Situational Awareness,Received Signal Strength Indicator,"
"detection of invalid ais messages using machine learning techniques","2022","Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data.","maritime domain awareness,AIS,automatic identification system,machine learning,"

The historical traffic routes are obtained by pre-processing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data via the CMRE tool called Traffic Route Extraction for Anomaly Detection (TREAD). These recurrent routes allow prediction of the position of a vessel that is following one of these routes, surprisingly, by several hours. The method is validated using a case study related to the second data campaign of the EC FP7 Project New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance (NEREIDS)1. We demonstrate that the prediction accuracy is well represented by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.","surveillance,New Service Capabilities for Integrated and Advanced Maritime Surveillance,anomaly detection,security of data,Stochastic processes,Predictive models,Transmitters,historical AIS traffic pattern,vessel position prediction uncertainty,context enhanced vessel prediction method,NEREIDS,automatic identification system,CMRE tool,stochastic processes,marine engineering,Target tracking,maritime domain,Radar tracking,Real-time systems,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process,traffic route extraction,traffic engineering computing,parameter estimation,Data mining,traffic route analysis,EC FP7 Project,"

"a generic bayesian network for identification and assessment of objects in maritime surveillance","2012","Identification and assessment of objects are key capabilities of surveillance and information systems for maritime environments. Bayesian methodology provides established instruments for fusion of uncertain identification and assessment indications from various information sources. Particularly, Bayesian Networks are well qualified for modeling and inference in this application context. In order to standardize and simplify generation of Bayesian Identification Networks for new operational scenarios, a generic Bayesian Network for identification is proposed. This generic model defines adequate and necessary node types, well suited for modeling of identification and assessment tasks. In addition, the model provides a dependency structure by subgraphs, which simplifies provision of more complex cause-effect relations in Bayesian Identification Networks. Nevertheless, the generic model is flexible enough to cover various application scenarios with manifold operational demands. Closing, generation of a Bayesian smuggler detection Network for maritime surveillance in an exemplary littoral application scenario is presented.","surveillance,military radar,Bayesian Network,Bayesian identification networks,marine radar,generic Bayesian network,Generic Model,cause-effect relations,Identification,Marine vehicles,Taxonomy,belief networks,Bayesian methodology,Sea measurements,Affiliation & Threat Assessment,Uncertainty Modeling,target tracking,Bayesian smuggler detection,Bayesian methods,information systems,maritime surveillance,Context,Maritime Surveillance Systems,radar tracking,dependency structure,Uncertainty,Surveillance,"
"six years of electrified convection over the island of corsica monitored by saetta: general trends and anomalously electrified thunderstorms during african dust south flow events","2022","By means of the SAETTA 3D lightning mapping array, the total lightning activity has been detected in a 240 km × 240 km square domain centred on the island of Corsica located in the West Mediterranean basin, and characterized by a maritime and mountainous environment, with a complex and relatively high relief. The study period covers the months from April to December of the 6 years from 2014 to 2019. Observations are reported with a horizontal resolution of 1 km and a vertical resolution of 0.1 km in terms of density of VHF sources emitted by lightning, and of number of lightning day, in plane- and vertical- projections. Vertical distributions of VHF sources are also provided monthly for the whole period and over the full domain. These 3D long term observations show that the number of lightning days is more important on the main relief of the island. The density of VHF sources exhibits a sharp maximum over the confluence area of the 3 main valleys in the center of the northern part of the island, characterized by a recurrent and vertically well developed lightning activity. The period from 11:00 UTC to 14:00 UTC in July, and in a lesser extent in June and August, is at the origin of this density maximum. This behavior is thus due to a diurnal convection. The whole lightning activity is characterized by 2 maxima in June and September. The first one is linked with the diurnal convection in phase with the maximum elevation of the Sun. The second one must be due to usual large-scale organized thunderstorm events of the fall season. The vertical distribution of VHF sources exhibits an increase in the number of VHF sources from April to August at all altitudes, as well as an increase in the altitude of the main upper peak (from 5.8 km to 10 km) and of the secondary lower peak (from 4.2 km to 6.7 km) of this distribution. From August to December, the opposite evolution appears, except that October is characterized by a strong anomaly with a single intense lower peak at 5.5 km, apparently due to 2 strong events corresponding to anomalously electrified thunderstorms. Several of these anomalously electrified thunderstorms (negative dipoles) are reported. They are all characterized by the movement of cloud cells spatially small and relatively undeveloped vertically propagating from southwest to northeast and associated with a strong transport of desert dust from the African continent. The analysis of the meteorological environment of some of the studied events allows concluding that in each of the studied cases elevated convection was triggered, above the relatively dry atmospheric boundary layer characterized by a strong convective inhibition. The low cloud liquid water content which is a key parameter of the non-inductive charging process is probably a good candidate to explain the anomalous electrification of these events.","Lightning,Anomalous charge structure,Corsica,Aerosol,Long term observations,Convection,African dust,"

"recovery at the edge of error: debunking the myth of the infallible expert","2011","The notion that human error should not be tolerated is prevalent in both the public and personal perception of the performance of clinicians. However, researchers in other safety–critical domains have long since abandoned the quest for zero defects as an impractical goal, choosing to focus instead on the development of strategies to enhance the ability to recover from error. This paper presents a cognitive framework for the study of error recovery, and the results of our empirical research into error detection and recovery in the critical care domain, using both laboratory-based and naturalistic approaches. Both attending physicians and residents were prone to commit, detect and recover from errors, but the nature of these errors was different. Experts corrected the errors as soon as they detected them and were better able to detect errors requiring integration of multiple elements in the case. Residents were more cautious in making decisions showing a slower error recovery pattern, and the detected errors were more procedural in nature with specific patient outcomes. Error detection and correction are shown to be dependent on expertise, and on the nature of the everyday tasks of the clinicians concerned. Understanding the limits and failures of human decision-making is important if we are to build robust decision-support systems to manage the boundaries of risk of error in decision-making. Detection and correction of potential error is an integral part of cognitive work in the complex, critical care workplace.","Naturalistic,Decision making,Patient safety,Error recovery,Cognitive informatics,Expertise,Error detection,Laboratory-based,"

The study is based on real sensor data streamed from a ship to shore, where the data is analysed through a big data analytics platform. The novelty of this work originates in the use of data from sensors covering different aspects of the ship operation, exemplified here by propulsion power, speed over ground and ship motion in four different degrees of freedom. The developed method employs Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) for signal reconstruction, and the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) technique for anomaly detection, where different hypothesis tests looking both at mean and variance deviations have been tested. In order to compare different settings, formal state of the art performance metrics have been used. We demonstrate that the AAKR model produces good reconstructions when the observations are similar to observations represented in the training data, and for some examples of simulated anomalies, the method reveals the abnormal behaviour. As long as the parameters are tuned carefully, alarms are triggered appropriately by the SPRT.","AAKR model,sequential probability ratio test,Kernel,Industries,Marine vehicles,ship motion,regression analysis,Signal reconstruction,marine propulsion,data analysis,ships,auto associative kernel regression,propulsion power,marine engineering,maritime transport,Training data,signal reconstruction,Measurement,Big Data,Robustness,ship speed,degrees of freedom,maritime industry,Big Data analytics platform,real sensor data streaming,ship operation,SPRT technique,sensor-based anomaly detection application,"
"2df-ids: decentralized and differentially private federated learning-based intrusion detection system for industrial iot","2023","Advanced technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), underpin many of the innovations in Industry 4.0. However, the interconnectivity and open nature of such systems in smart industrial facilities can also be targeted and abused by malicious actors, which reinforces the importance of cyber security. In this paper, we present a secure, decentralized, and Differentially Private (DP) Federated Learning (FL)-based IDS (2DF-IDS), for securing smart industrial facilities. The proposed 2DF-IDS comprises three building blocks, namely: a key exchange protocol (for securing the communicated weights among all peers in the system), a differentially private gradient exchange scheme (achieve improved privacy of the FL approach), and a decentralized FL approach (that mitigates the single point of failure/attack risk associated with the aggregation server in the conventional FL approach). We evaluate our proposed system through detailed experiments using a real-world IoT/IIoT dataset, and the results show that the proposed 2DF-IDS system can identify different types of cyber attacks in an Industrial IoT system with high performance. For instance, the proposed system achieves comparable performance (94.37%) with the centralized learning approach (94.37%) and outperforms the FL-based approach (93.91%) in terms of accuracy. The proposed system is also shown to improve the overall performance by 12%, 13%, and 9% in terms of F1-score, recall, and precision, respectively, under strict privacy settings when compared to other competing FL-based IDS solutions.","Industry 4.0,Intrusion detection,Decentralized federated learning,Differential privacy,IoT/IIoT security,Privacy,Cybersecurity,Post-Quantum cryptography,"
"horizon detection from electro-optical sensors under maritime environment","2020","In recent years, target detection in maritime surveillance has become a popular subject. Horizon under maritime environment is one of the most important semantic boundaries for segmenting the image into sea and sky. With the help of horizon, seeking scope can be restricted to a definite small area, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. Meanwhile, horizon is used to automatically adjust the attitude of air vehicles as well. Although a plenty of algorithms for horizon detection have been created, they are prone to low visibility and occlusions. In this paper, a novel robust algorithm based on probability distribution and physical characteristics is proposed. At first, the probabilities are distributed to each vertically divided region by weighted textures, and the sea-sky region is located from definite probabilistic intervals. Based on a Canny edge detector, Hough transform extracts a series of candidate horizons. Finally, a novel voting method is applied. The line with the maximum value will be regarded as the true horizon. The proposed algorithm can not only precisely detect the horizon from fine images but also from blurred image, even with splashed camera. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments on 65 videos containing more than 20 000 frames under different sceneries. The results illustrate that our algorithm can detect the horizon line with minor errors in comparison with other five state-of-the-art algorithms.","Image edge detection,electro-optical sensors,target detection,Feature extraction,Contextual information,Image color analysis,edge detection,sea-sky region,seaâ€“sky region extraction,Hough transforms,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probability distribution,image texture,horizon detection,electro-optical devices,physical characteristics,semantic boundaries,electro-optical sensor,maritime environment,marine communication,image sensors,Sensors,Computational modeling,image segmentation,Transforms,"
"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"
"hfpnet: super feature aggregation pyramid network for maritime remote sensing small-object detection","2023","In recent years, with the development of the maritime industry, computer vision tasks based on optical remote sensing images have gained increasing attention in the field of marine remote sensing. However, in complex marine meteorological environments, traditional detection methods often suffer from high rates of missed detections and false alarms for small targets. To address this issue, this article proposes a super feature pyramid network (HFPNet) for detecting marine remote sensing objects, which includes a feature enhancement module (FEM) and a multiscale feature aggregation module (MFM). The FEM can highlight features of small targets and weaken complex background features in detection, the MFM can share high-level and low-level features to better fuse multiscale feature information. Additionally, due to the lack of marine remote sensing object datasets, this article constructs a marine target detection dataset (MTDS) containing six types of marine objects. To address the issue of imbalanced positive and negative samples in the dataset, this article designs a network loss function to accelerate network convergence and improve the accuracy of small-target detection. Compared with other models, HFPNet achieved the highest $\text{mAP}_{0.5}$ of 97.48% and 95.46% on the self-built dataset MTDS and the public dataset NWPU-VHR-10, respectively, after environmental enhancement. At the same time, it also achieved the fastest frames per second (FPS) on the test set.

"organizational responsiveness: the case of unfolding crises and problem detection within helcom","2016","How and to what extent do international organizations detect, process and react to different types of change within their policy domains? This study addresses this question by combining a unique data set consisting of policy documents from the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) with data measuring ecosystem change in the Baltic Sea during the period 1980–2013. Here HELCOM's responses to two types of ecosystem changes are investigated: fast and visible (summer algae blooms) and slow and opaque (anoxic areas). Finally, this study assesses if the organizational reform of 2007, which introduced the ecosystem approach, has had any effects on HELCOM responsiveness. It is found that HELCOM, contrary to expectations, is only responding systematically to slow-moving and opaque processes but that this response confirms the anticipated organizational bottom-up pattern. The ecosystem approach reform seems to have had a negative effect on the responsiveness of HELCOM; however, a general trend is that HELCOM over time has become more responsive in the lower levels of the organization. The lack of an immediate effect regarding the ecosystem approach reform can serve as a reminder of the absence of panaceas in policy making in general, and in environmental governance in particular.","Organizational response,Baltic Sea,Helsinki Commission,Eutrophication,"
"global decrease in heavy metal concentrations in brown algae in the last 90 years","2023","In the current scenario of global change, heavy metal pollution is of major concern because of its associated toxic effects and the persistence of these pollutants in the environment. This study is the first to evaluate the changes in heavy metal concentrations worldwide in brown algae over the last 90 years (>15,700 data across the globe reported from 1933 to 2020). The study findings revealed significant decreases in the concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb and Zn of around 60–84% (ca. 2% annual) in brown algae tissues. The decreases were consistent across the different families considered (Dictyotaceae, Fucaceae, Laminariaceae, Sargassaceae and Others), and began between 1970 and 1990. In addition, strong relationships between these trends and pH, SST and heat content were detected. Although the observed metal declines could be partially explained by these strong correlations, or by adaptions in the algae, other evidences suggest an actual reduction in metal concentrations in oceans because of the implementation of environmental policies. In any case, this study shows a reduction in metal concentrations in brown algae over the last 50 years, which is important in itself, as brown algae form the basis of many marine food webs and are therefore potential distributors of pollutants.","Temporal trends,Hazardous elements,Marine pollution,Biomonitoring,Climate change,"

"synergistic abiotic and biotic stressors explain widespread decline of pinus pinaster in a mixed forest","2019","Global change potentially increases forest vulnerability. Different abiotic and biotic factors may interact to cause forest decline and accelerated tree mortality. We studied a mixed Mediterranean continental forest where Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) shows widespread decline to analyse the role of different abiotic and biotic factors on health status and growth dynamics both at the individual and plot levels. We also analysed stand composition and regeneration of tree species to check whether there is a change in species dominance. Fungal pathogens were seldom present and we detected no pervasive fungi or insect infestation and no presence of pathogens like Heterobasidion or Phytophthora. Infection of hemiparasite plants like Viscum album L. (mistletoe) can reduce leaf area and its abundance is generally considered an expression of host decline. Yet, the existence among declining trees of high defoliation levels without mistletoe, but not vice versa, suggests that defoliation in response to some abiotic stressor could be a predisposing factor preceding mistletoe infection. Compared to healthy trees, declining and dead trees exhibited higher defoliation rates, smaller needles and lower recent growth with steeper negative trends. Dead and declining trees showed similar negative growth trends since the early 1990s droughts, which we interpreted as early warning signals anticipating mortality of currently declining trees in the near future. Mortality of maritime pine extending across all size classes, the lower presence of this species in the smallest size classes and its lack of regeneration suggest it is potentially losing its current dominance and being replaced by other co-occurring, more drought-tolerant species. Our results unravelled that maritime pine decline seems to be mainly driven by a combination of predisposing and inciting abiotic factors (microenvironment and drought stress) and biotic factors (mistletoe). The absence of widespread fungal pathogens suggests that they may have a minor role on pine decline acting only eventually as contributing factors. Although there could be other interrelations among factors or other biotic agents at play, our results strongly suggest that water stress plays a major role in the decline process of the dominant species on an ecosystem with strong land-use legacies.","Abiotic stress,Mistletoe,Defoliation,Drought,Land-use,Fungal pathogens,"
"controls on rainfall variability in the tropical south pacific for the last 350 years reconstructed from oxygen isotopes in stalagmites from the cook islands","2022","The hydroclimate of the South Pacific is highly variable on a range of timescales, however, the brevity of instrumental data in the region complicates the detection and attribution of this variability. Annually laminated speleothems may fill this knowledge gap by providing paleo-hydroclimate proxy data extending beyond the instrumental period. In this study, replicated oxygen isotope (δ18O) time series from two stalagmites from Pouatea (Pu17) and Nurau (Nu16) caves in the southern Cook Islands were used to reconstruct the variability of effective infiltration over the past 350 years (1672–2019 CE) based on observational rainfall data and cave monitoring and calcite farming experiments. The reconstructed infiltration was then compared to available reconstructions of known climate drivers of the South Pacific. Significant dry and wet periods over the last 350 years were identified based on the δ18O signal of compact/porous calcite fabric and their δ13C signals. The hydroclimate significance of these proxies was validated through comparison with the instrumental records. We could not reach an annual resolution of reconstructed infiltration, due to a combination of stable isotope sampling limitations and mixing effects within the aquifer. Nevertheless, the combined δ18O record of Pu17 and Nu16 identifies that the main driver of infiltration and, hence rainfall variability, in the southern Cook Islands is the location of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), which in turn is modulated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study demonstrates the hydroclimate significance of speleothem fabrics when combined with O and C stable isotopes, and adds paleoclimate information to a region that has a paucity of data.","ENSO,Stalagmites,Rainfall,SPCZ,Paleoclimate,δO,"

We here relate these concepts to the JDL fusion model and demonstrate the power of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) for encoding uncertain knowledge and compute inferences according to observed evidence. MLNs combine the expressive power of first-order logic and the probabilistic uncertainty management of Markov networks. Within this framework, different types of knowledge (e.g. a priori, contextual) with associated uncertainty can be fused together for situation assessment by expressing unobservable complex events as a logical combination of simpler evidences. We also develop a mechanism to evaluate the level of completion of complex events and show how, along with event probability, it could provide additional useful information to the operator. Examples are demonstrated on two maritime scenarios of rules for event and anomaly detection.","Uncertainty management,Situational awareness,Markov Logic Networks,Context-based fusion,"
"enhancing maritime safety through iot-integrated high-pressure water mist fire fighting system","2023","The use of fire suppression systems is crucial in ensuring the safety of people and property in case of a fire outbreak. In this research, a High-Pressure Water Mist Fire Fighting System is proposed that utilizes a combination of various sensors, including temperature, smoke, flame, pressure, leak, and IoT sensors, to detect and suppress fires effectively. The system works by detecting a fire using the sensors, triggering the fire suppression mechanism, and using high-pressure water mist to extinguish the fire. The proposed system offers several benefits over traditional fire suppression systems. Firstly, the use of water mist as an extinguishing agent provides better fire suppression efficacy compared to traditional fire suppression agents like water or foam. This is because water mist can penetrate deep into the fire, cool down the temperature, and reduce the concentration of flammable gases, thus putting off the fire. Secondly, the system uses IoT sensors to connect the fire suppression system to the internet, enabling remote monitoring and control. This enhances the safety and efficiency of the system, as maintenance personnel can monitor the system remotely and respond to any alarms or issues quickly. In conclusion, the proposed High-Pressure Water Mist Fire Fighting System offers a more effective and efficient solution for fire suppression, especially in high-risk environments like ships, industrial facilities, and data centers. The use of a combination of various sensors, including IoT sensors, enables the system to detect and suppress fires quickly and accurately, thus ensuring the safety of people and property. This research highlights the potential of such a system in enhancing fire safety and highlights the importance of continued research in this area.","safety,Fire fighting,Sensors,industry 4.0,Temperature sensors,microcontroller,Marine vehicles,Fires,Temperature measurement,Sensor systems,sensor,Ventilation,"
"frequency based satellite monitoring of small scale explosive activity at remote north pacific volcanoes","2014","Monitoring of volcanoes in the North Pacific can be an expensive and sometimes dangerous task, specifically for those located in Alaska (USA) and Kamchatka (Russia). An active frequency detection method previously used at Stromboli, Italy, uses the thermal- and mid-infrared wavelength bands from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to detect anomalies at a volcano. This method focuses on small scale explosive activity, often referred to as Strombolian activity which can produce small spatter fields near a volcano's active vent. In the North Pacific, there are a number of volcanoes which exhibit small scale explosive activity and three are the focus of this study: Chuginadak (Mt. Cleveland) and Shishaldin in Alaska, and Karymsky Volcano in Kamchatka. Satellite images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were used to monitor the frequency of thermal features as well as the occurrence of ash plumes at each volcano. This data was then used to produce a time series spanning 2005–2010 for all three volcanoes. During this time period, each volcano underwent a series of eruptive cycles including background levels of activity, heightened frequency of small explosions (identified as precursory activity), and heightened activity typified by ash plume-producing eruptions. Each location has a unique precursory signal, both in timing and magnitude. The use of a previously developed method on a new sample set of volcanoes has proved the validity of this method as a monitoring tool for volcanoes with small scale explosive activity. This method should be applied to a larger set of volcanoes to continue the development and database production for its use as a volcano monitoring tool.","Thermal infrared,Explosive activity,Remote sensing,Volcano monitoring,North Pacific,"

"quantitative and qualitative evaluation of plastic particles in surface waters of the western black sea","2021","Microplastic abundances have been studied intensively in the last years in marine and freshwater environments worldwide. Though several articles have been published about the Mediterranean Sea, only few studies about the Black Sea exist. The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea and may therefore significantly contribute to the Mediterranean marine pollution. So far, only very few articles have been published about micro-, meso- and macroplastic abundances in the Western Black Sea. In order to fill this knowledge gap and to decipher the number of plastics on the water surface, 12 samples were collected from surface waters with a neustonic net (mesh size 200 μm) in the Black Sea close to the Danube Delta and the Romanian shore. Organic matter was digested and plastic particles were isolated by density separation. The results of visual inspection, pyrolysis GC-MS (for microplastics) and ATR-FTIR (for mesoplastics >5 mm) revealed an average concentration of 7 plastic particles/m³, dominated by fibers (∼76%), followed by foils (∼13%) and fragments (∼11%). Only very few spherules were detected. The polymers polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) dominated which is in line with other studies analyzing surface waters from rivers in Western Europe as well as in China. Statistical analyses show that the plastic concentration close to the mouth of the Danube River was significantly higher than at four nearshore regions along the Romanian and Bulgarian coastline. This could be explained by plastic inputs from the Danube River into the western part of the Black Sea.","Danube Delta,Romanian coast,Plastic pollution,Spectroscopy,Black Sea,"
"an evaluation of volcanic cloud detection techniques during recent significant eruptions in the western ‘ring of fire’","2004","We examined recent volcanic cloud events in the Western Pacific and Indonesian area, to validate the performance of remote sensing techniques used to support the International Airways Volcano Watch (IAVW). Five events were considered, during which eruptions from eight volcanoes injected ash into the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere. For one of the eruptions, at Miyakejima, Japan, at least five aircraft encountered volcanic ash clouds, and the cost to three operators alone exceeded US $12,000,000 in aircraft repairs, diversions, and lost operating time. We performed ‘reverse’ absorption and ‘pattern analysis’ using GMS-5/VISSR, MODIS and AVHRR data, and we examined TOMS SO2 and Aerosol Index data, surface-based observations, pilot reports, and dispersion model output. Our results verify that the introduction of ‘reverse’ absorption using the geostationary GMS-5 platform significantly enhanced our capacity to monitor volcanic ash clouds in the region. In one case, we tracked an eruption cloud for approximately 80 h. The primary impediment to remote monitoring is the presence of overlying cloud, or substantial amounts of ice within the volcanic clouds. TOMS data showed success in identifying volcanic clouds during these conditions, but was limited by the infrequency of observations. More effective future operation of the IAVW relies on developing complementary methods of volcanic cloud remote sensing, and greatly increasing the amount and quality of available surface and air observations, including observations of precursor activity. An understanding of the likely future limitations of remote sensing techniques will aid in the refining of IAVW procedures.","Volcanic eruptions,Satellite remote sensing,Aviation safety,Volcanic ash detection,"
"sensorized buoy for oil spill early detection","2016","The Sea is often a fragile environment to be protected against possible pollutants. In this context, the present work contributes to its safeguard by proposing a new buoy equipped with advanced sensors for the detection of oil spills. In particular, the buoy is provided with various sensors for the evaluation of both meteorological and marine parameters (e.g. waves, wind, temperature), and chemical/physical data acquired by an electronic nose system specifically designed for the detection of hydrocarbons. The electronic nose is composed of a flow chamber, a chamber equipped with photo ionization sensors, pumps and valves for air inlet and outlet, and a low-cost electronic board. The designed system samples the air above the water and produces data that are processed through two artificial neural networks allowing for a classification of detected hydrocarbons and overall pollution level. Suitable network interfaces and a connector toward a Marine Information System (MIS) allow both for real-time data visualization and for long-term assessment of water quality.","Oil spills,Marine pollution,Hydrocarbons classification,Sensorized buoy,Electronic noses,"
"target observability improvement in multi-static maritime forward scatter radar","2014","In recent years, the use of shore or buoy mounted forward scatter radar transceivers for the detection of small, low radar cross section, slow speed (otherwise termed low detectability) maritime targets has been proposed and investigated. Work has focused on the fundamental development of the single baseline link, which would form the basis of any netted system and has mostly been investigated at the lower end of the sea state scale. However as sea state increases, one of the main issues for target detection becomes the visibility time due to line of sight interruption. With a single line chain, this could be a major drawback for the system function as a whole, restricting its use to lower sea states. The formation of multiple baselines using multi-static transceivers could however improve the situation greatly. This paper investigates target observability in both single baseline and multi-baseline systems in an effort to estimate the level of improvement possible.","multistatic transceivers,Antennas,maritime,Vectors,radar detection,radio transceivers,target detection,Surface waves,line of sight interruption,observability,forward scatter,multi-static,radar target recognition,Sea surface,Surface treatment,buoy mounted forward scatter radar transceivers,Sea state,radar network,Radar,multistatic maritime forward scatter radar,baseline link,target observability,radar cross section,"
"a new road safety indicator based on vehicle trajectory analysis","2016","In 2014, in France, accidents on rural roads accounted for roughly 63% of road mortality (ONISR, 2014). Yet, the locations of accidents are increasingly spread, and it is becoming difficult for road managers to set priorities for interventions on their road network. They can no longer base their strategy on accident analysis. Road managers need to quickly measure the effectiveness of a modified facility, improvement of facilities or modification of the environment. On this type of site accident analysis requires a period of 3 to 5 years to determine the effectiveness of a change. This period of time does not meet the requirements of road managers or road users. To provide a high safety level, managers are implementing innovative developments: wall effect chicane at crossroads, dynamic warning signs, rural roundabouts, etc. Managers want to quickly assess these innovations. In addition, they have less and less money, so it is necessary to give them tools to help prioritize their intervention. It is also preferable for road managers to take preventive action rather than having to wait for accidents or serious injuries to occur, in order to carry out diagnosis and propose countermeasures. In this article, we propose a new safety indicator based on trajectory analysis. By trajectory, we mean a time-function that describes vehicle movement including not only its path on the road but also speeds and accelerations in both horizontal directions (longitudinal and transverse). These trajectories describe vehicle/infrastructure/driver interactions and reveal inadequacies that can lead to accidents. These trajectories are obtained using two roadside observation systems that analyse vehicle trajectories on two specific locations: curves and intersections on rural roads. The first tool is a local trajectory measurement system. It records trajectories of all vehicles passing through a specific zone. The goal is to observe abnormal paths that reveal dysfunctions in the vehicle/Infrastructure/driver system. The main applications-related contribution of this work focuses on developing a comprehensive solution for accurately estimating vehicle trajectories based on a combination of video images and range finder (telemeter) measurements. The purpose of the second tool is to improve understanding of dysfunctions at a crossroads and to evaluate the effectiveness of facilities. A precise study of patterns encountered on accident-prone intersections on rural roads showed that some situations are much more dangerous and frequent than others. In particular, most accidents at intersections are caused by vehicles crossing main roads. The second system presented in this paper detects and records conflicts between users on the secondary road who are crossing the main road, and users driving straight ahead on the main road. This kind of conflict represents the main type of accidents called crossing at grade accidents. The proposed risk indicator is equal to the number of conflicts (near-misses), weighted by the severity of the conflicts recorded in a given period. We chose to take the number of conflicts per hour. The purpose of these tools is to understand anomalies in the vehicle/infrastructure/driver system, and to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on safety. Associated with risk indicators they make it possible to objectively assess driver behaviours with respect to the road infrastructure.","safety,trajectories,curves,intersections,evaluation,"

"engine vibration anomaly detection in vessel engine room","2022","Unsupervised and autonomous operations require new, more efficient, and smarter technical solutions. Digitalization is one of the enablers of autonomous operation, with installing new sensors and using the data for AI and machine learning. The trend is to move the handling the vast amount of data from sensors, installed in machines, and devices, close to the sensors. This way, data communication can be heavily reduced, while the latency of decisions based on data can be minimal. This is achieved by moving the advanced data analysis capabilities from the cloud to the edge. In this paper, the driver of technological development is the concept of an unmanned machine room, where the normal inspections performed by personnel are automated using sensors and algorithms.We present an analysis of vibration data, recorded at a cruise ferry\x92s engines, using a signal processing method called cepstrums. A cepstrum is a version of frequency analysis, intending to identify and visualize periodic structures in data using cepstrograms. Compared to spectrogram analysis, usage of cepstrogram enables better visualization of engine behavior into the shape of audio signals. This helped us discover the run-time vibration routine of the engines from where we could observe unusual vibration sensing generated from the engine. We started studying the unusual behavior and came to the conclusion that the engine is sometimes misfiring the cylinders, generating anomalies","anomaly,unmanned machine room,edge computing,vibration analysis,cepstrum,data communication,autonomous operation,unsupervised,"

A power budget analysis is detailed for Inmarsat signals, considering both the reference and the radar channels. The effect of sea clutter is also examined. It is shown that relatively poor range resolution can be improved if the available communication channels are combined to improve the bandwidth, a process that also improves the sensitivity.

"wasrâ€”a water segmentation and refinement maritime obstacle detection network","2022","Obstacle detection using semantic segmentation has become an established approach in autonomous vehicles. However, existing segmentation methods, primarily developed for ground vehicles, are inadequate in an aquatic environment as they produce many false positive (FP) detections in the presence of water reflections and wakes. We propose a novel deep encoderâ€“decoder architecture, a water segmentation and refinement (WaSR) network, specifically designed for the marine environment to address these issues. A deep encoder based on ResNet101 with atrous convolutions enables the extraction of rich visual features, while a novel decoder gradually fuses them with inertial information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The inertial information greatly improves the segmentation accuracy of the water component in the presence of visual ambiguities, such as fog on the horizon. Furthermore, a novel loss function for semantic separation is proposed to enforce the separation of different semantic components to increase the robustness of the segmentation. We investigate different loss variants and observe a significant reduction in FPs and an increase in true positives (TPs). Experimental results show that WaSR outperforms the current state of the art by approximately 4% in F1 score on a challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset. WaSR shows remarkable generalization capabilities and outperforms the state of the art by over 24% in F1 score on a strict domain generalization experiment.","separation loss,Semantic segmentation,Neural Networks,remotely operated vehicles,semantic segmentation,different loss variants,ResNet101,water component,unmanned surface vehicles (USVs),Feature extraction,marine environment,novel decoder,water reflections,Image Processing,WaSR-a water segmentation,novel loss function,atrous convolutions,false positive detections,ground vehicles,inertial measurement unit,computer vision,autonomous vehicles,feature extraction,Computer,challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset,different semantic components,positives,wakes,obstacle detection,segmentation accuracy,inertial information,Water,Image segmentation,established approach,Autonomous vehicles,mobile robots,Deep learning,aquatic environment,deep encoder-decoder architecture,refinement maritime obstacle detection network,Computer-Assisted,image segmentation,collision avoidance,existing segmentation methods,learning (artificial intelligence),visual ambiguities,refinement network,rich visual features,semantic separation,"

"the costa concordia last cruise: the first application of high frequency monitoring based on cosmo-skymed constellation for wreck removal","2016","The Italian vessel Costa Concordia wrecked on January 13th 2012 offshore the Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), with the loss of 32 lives. Salvage operation of the vessel started immediately after the wreck. This operation was the largest and most expensive maritime salvage ever attempted on a wrecked ship and it ended in July 2014 when the Costa Concordia was removed from the Giglio Island, and dragged in the port of Genoa where it was dismantled. The refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were monitored, in the period between 14th and 27th of July, exploiting SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in crisis mode. The main targets of the monitoring system were: (i) the detection of possible spill of pollutant material from the vessel and (ii) to exclude that oil slicks, illegally produced by other vessels, could be improperly linked to the naval convoy during its transit along the route between the Giglio Island and the port of Genoa. Results point out that the adopted monitoring system, through the use of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can be profitably employed to monitor emergency phases related to single ship or naval convoy over wide areas and with a suitable temporal coverage. Furthermore, the refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were a success because no pollution was produced during the operations.","COSMO-SkyMed,Oil spill,Costa Concordia,SAR,Wreck,"
"detection and mapping of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments","2015","The paper discusses the detection of shipwrecks embedded in sea-floor sediments using a Chirp sub-bottom profiler. From a methodological-historical perspective it presents four examples of recent chirp recordings of verified shipwrecks embedded in different types of sediment environments, from different geographical and geological areas and from different periods. The effects of shallow water depths, different sediment types, recording speed and different (2D and 3D) sub-bottom profiler systems are briefly discussed. It is concluded that Chirps are well suited for survey purposes, producing high quality 2D profiles of good resolution and satisfactory penetration depth. Furthermore, the equipment is easy to handle from a small boat and allows flexible sailing. This type of 2D data is cheaper and faster to acquire and is easier to interpret and apparently also provides better resolution and detail than present 3D systems. Chirp data are therefore of great value in identifying and outlining shipwrecks hidden in the sea floor in survey situations where larger areas must be covered. The overall conclusion is that there are grounds for optimism with regard to this method of detection of maritime archaeological targets.","Subbottom seismics,Shallow water,Hard sediments,Akko,Mapping,Shipwreck,Detection,Maritime archaeology,"

"a novel hybrid approach for detecting abnormal vessel behavior in maritime traffic","2023","The Abnormal Behavior Detection of Vessels (ABVD) is crucial for enhancing Vesselsâ€™ situational awareness as well as achieving effective management of maritime traffic. Clustering algorithms are extensively employed for ABVD tasks, however, they are not only time-consuming but also frequently inaccurate when dealing with complex and dynamic vessel trajectory detection tasks. To address the above problems, we propose a novel hybrid approach, CSDLSTM(Course/Speed-DBSCAN and LSTM), which combines Density-based Clustering(DBSCAN) and long short-term memory networks to improve the efficiency of ABVD. Specifically, a three-dimensional CS-DBSCAN (Course/Speed-DBSCAN) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates speed and course features along with geospatial information in the clustering process to accurately describe vessel behavior. In addition, the clustering results are used as traffic patterns to train the LSTM predictor for real-time maritime anomaly detection. Experiments conducted on real AIS datasets demonstrate that the CSD-LSTM method has greater precision and efficiency in ABVD.","Traffic control,Transportation,Clustering algorithms,LSTM,Prediction algorithms,CS-DBSCAN,Sensitivity,Real-time systems,Heuristic algorithms,abnormal vessel behavior,"

"a novel quality control method of time-series ocean wave observation data combining deep-learning prediction and statistical analysis","2023","Quality control (QC) of marine data is a critical aspect in ensuring the usability of oceanic data. In this paper, we propose a novel QC method for time-series ocean wave data, which combines deep learning prediction and statistical analysis. Our method first realizes multi-element LSTM prediction of the time-series ocean wave observation data, capturing both temporal consistency and physical relationships between the multi-element inputs. Then, it applies peak detection on the regional mean difference ratio derived from the predicted and true values of the ocean wave data, and finally labels the anomalous data points based on peak detection results. We conducted experiments on the time-series wave data of four sites from the National Marine Science Center, China, and compared our proposed method with traditional QC method that is currently used for operational marine data quality control, as well as classic anomaly detection models including Isolation Forest and VAE-LSTM. The results show a significant improvement in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for erroneous samples using our proposed method.

"a preliminary study on an optical system for nautical and maritime traffic monitoring","2021","The nautical traffic is very difficult to monitor since many vessels are not cooperative. VTSs (Vessel Traffic Systems) use several sources of information for estimating shipsâ€™ Position Navigation and Velocity, such as AIS (Automatic Identification System) and RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging); nevertheless, VTS areas do not cover the entire costal area of a country. In many cases the classification and identification of small non-AIS vessels could provide an important to the safety of navigation.Indeed, especially during the summer, the nautical tourism has a great impact on the maritime traffic congestion. The issue involves many institutions such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and local maritime authorities which are not able to monitor the high volume of nautical traffic. This work introduces an optical system designed to monitor the traffic in small coastal areas based on images acquired by a single camera. The reliability and accuracy of the system is conditioned by the size of the pixel on the sea surface (Ground Sample Distance-GSD) and by the camera footprint area as well. More in detail, this work focuses on the detection of the best camera placement on the coast for optimizing the GSD size and obtaining the shape of camera footprint.

"pixel-wise ship identification from maritime images via a semantic segmentation model","2022","Accurately identifying ships from maritime surveillance videos attracts increasing attention in the smart ship community, considering that the videos provide informative yet easily understandable spatialâ€“temporal traffic information for varied maritime traffic participants. Previous studies (e.g., ship detection and ship tracking) are conducted by learning distinct features from training samples labeled in terms of bounding boxes, and thus, background pixels may be wrongly trained as ship features. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel approach for achieving a pixel-wise ship segmentation and identification task through a novel design of U-Net deep learning architecture (denoted as EU-Net). The encoder of the EU-Net extracts distinct ship features from input maritime images, and its decoder outputs ship segmentation results in the pixel-wise manner. The proposed EU-Net model consists of encoder and decoder parts via the help of a convolution layer, a depth separable convolution layer, a softmax layer, and so on. More specifically, the EU-Net model identifies each pixel into ship or non-ship as the final output. Experimental results suggest that our proposed model can accurately identify ship (in terms of pixels), considering that the ship segmentation accuracies were larger than 99%.

Since a large fraction of the predicted CO2 storage capacity lies offshore, there is a pressing need to develop field-tested methods to detect and quantify potential leaks in the marine environment. Here, we combine field measurements with numerical models to determine the flow rate of a controlled release of CO2 in a shallow marine setting at about 119 m water depth in the North Sea. In this experiment, CO2 was injected into the sediment at 3 m depth at 143 kg d-1. The new leakage monitoring tool predicts that 91 kg d-1 of CO2 escaped across the seafloor, and that 51 kg d-1 of CO2 were retained in the sediment, in agreement with independent field estimates. The new approach relies mostly on field data collected from ship-deployed technology (towed sensors, Acoustic Doppler current profiler—ADCP), which makes it a promising tool to monitor existing and upcoming offshore CO2 storage sites and to detect and quantify potential CO2 leakage.","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS),Marine CO leak detection,Carbon dioxide (CO),Marine CO leak quantification,Offshore CCS monitoring,CO leak simulations,"

A temporally consistent, long-term (30year) FT record was created, ensuring cross-sensor consistency through pixel-wise adjustment of the SMMR Tb record based on empirical analyses of overlapping SMMR and SSM/I measurements. The resulting FT record showed mean annual spatial classification accuracies of 91 (+/−8.6) and 84 (+/−9.3) percent for PM and AM overpass retrievals relative to in situ air temperature measurements from the global weather station network. The FT results were compared against other measures of biosphere activity including CO2 eddy flux tower measurements and satellite (MODIS) vegetation greenness (NDVI). The FT defined non-frozen season largely bounds the period of active vegetation growth and net ecosystem CO2 uptake for tower sites representing major biomes. Earlier spring thawing and longer non-frozen seasons generally benefit vegetation growth inferred from NDVI spring and summer growth anomalies where the non-frozen season is less than approximately 6months, with greater benefits at higher (>45°N) latitudes. A strong (P<0.001) increasing (0.189daysyr−1) trend in the Northern Hemisphere mean annual non-frozen season is largely driven by an earlier (−0.149daysyr−1) spring thaw trend and coincides with a 0.033°Cyr−1 regional warming trend. The FT record also shows a positive (0.199daysyr−1) trend in the number of transitional (AM frozen and PM non-frozen) frost days, which coincide with reduced vegetation productivity inferred from tower CO2 and MODIS NDVI measurements. The relative benefits of earlier and longer non-frozen seasons for vegetation growth under global warming may be declining due to opposing increases in disturbance, drought and frost damage related impacts.","ESDR,NDVI,CDR,Freeze thaw,SSM/I,Vegetation growing season,Phenology,SMMR,NASA MEaSUREs,Global warming,MODIS,Climate change,"

"spatio-temporal analysis of lightning activity over greece — preliminary results derived from the recent state precision lightning network","2014","Lightning is a natural phenomenon in the atmosphere, being a major cause of storm related deaths, main trigger of forest fires and affects many electrochemical systems of the body. Significant scientific interest has come up in the last decades, as numerous lightning detection networks have been established in operational basis, providing lightning data to assess and mitigate lightning impact to the local society by spatio-temporal analysis. In this study, a preliminary analysis of spatial and temporal variabilities of recorded lightnings over Greece during the period from January 2008 to December 2009 is presented. The data for retrieving the location and time-of-occurrence (TOA) of lightning were acquired from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS). An operational precision lightning network (PLN) has been established since 2007 by HNMS, consisting of eight time-of-arrival (TOA) sensors, spatially distributed across Greek territory. The spatial variability of lightnings revealed their incidence within specific geographical sub-regions while the temporal variability concerns the seasonal and monthly distributions. All the analyses were carried out with respect to cloud to cloud (CC), cloud to ground (CG) and ground to cloud (GC) lightnings, within the examined time period. During the autumn season, lightning activity was the highest, followed by summer and spring. Higher frequencies of stokes appear over Ionian Sea and Aegean Sea than over land during winter period against continental mountainous regions during summer period.","Cloud-to-cloud lightning,Hellenic National Meteorological Service,Operational precision lightning network,Ground-to-cloud lightning,Cloud-to-ground lightning,"
"a four year (2007–2010) analysis of long-lasting deep convective systems in the mediterranean basin","2013","Long-lasting, deep convective systems (DCS) occurring in the Mediterranean basin have been investigated for the 2007–2010years using geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite data, supported by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses and severe weather reports recorded by the European Severe Weather Database (ESWD). The spatial and seasonal variability of DCS occurrence have been investigated, as well as the most favourable synoptic precursors for their initiation. The analysis has shown the existence of some preferential areas of DCS genesis, mainly located in the western (i.e., around Balearic Islands) and central (i.e., Ionic and Tyrrhenian seas) Mediterranean, where these systems develop and grow preferentially in fall (i.e., September and October). The analysis of a selected set of Synoptic Precursors (SPs) has shown how the totality of the identified cases has occurred downstream a mid-tropospheric (500hPa) disturbance (trough or cut-off) within a southerly flow, with high values of θe (at 850hPa) and precipitable water. Moreover, the approaching of an upper level tropopause dynamical anomaly coupled with a local maximum of upper and low level horizontal wind speed, seems to play a very important role in triggering convection. Finally, a careful crosscheck of the detected cases with the ESWD reports has allowed to investigate the severity of these systems, as they often affect population and produce significant damages. This study has to be considered a necessary step towards the development of a larger climatologic database of long-lasting, deep convective events occurring in the Mediterranean sea, as well as the definition of a specific conceptual model based on synoptic precursors, having the long-term issue of setting up an objective procedure to support regional meteorological services in early decisions and accurate nowcasting.","Severe weather reports,Synoptic precursors,Deep convective systems,Mediterranean basin,Satellite imagery,"
"a hybrid particle filter-camshift model based solution for aerial maritime survivor search","2013","The speed for finding and locating the survivors from shipwrecks can never be considered to be too fast. Existing methods are either too slow or inefficient. In this paper, we proposed an effective solution by employing multi-camera cooperation mechanism and hybrid Particle filter-CAMSHIFT framework to realize the detection for survivors wearing Iifejackets from the airplanes. The multi-camera system can significantly enlarge the surveillance region while preserving the imaging quality with the zoomed cameras; and the hybrid framework can locate the survivors in the sea accurately and reliably based on the color clues. Moreover, this multi-camera cooperation mechanism has made our proposed system highly extendable, thus by including more cameras in the system, the imaging quality and monitoring power can be further enhanced.","Image edge detection,marine accidents,surveillance,airplanes,Cameras,color clues,shipwrecks,Reliability,surveillance region,emergency services,image colour analysis,zoomed camera,survivor detection,Iifejackets,nonparametric statistics,cameras,computer vision,object detection,particle filtering (numerical methods),imaging quality,monitoring power,multicamera cooperation mechanism,aerial maritime survivor search solution,hybrid particle filter-CAMSHIFT model,Optimized production technology,continuous adaptive MEANSHIFT,"
"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data. We conduct the experiments on real maritime trajectories to show the effectiveness of proposed Route Miner. In the future, Route Miner is going to serve as the photo type for exploring the solutions of the challenges those related to anomaly detection and traffic management in the maritime domain.","data mining,Vectors,movement behavior,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,movement behavior discovery,traffic management,ship trajectories,Trajectory Data Mining,mining ship routes,ship route mining,Ship Route Mining,marine systems,maritime trajectories,Vehicles,trajectory data analysis,route miner system,Maritime Trajectory,trajectory data mining,maritime domain,behavioral pattern,maritime traffic analysis,Roads,location prediction,Trajectory,massive maritime trajectories,Uncertainty,road networks,Data mining,maritime area,location-aware knowledge,"
"temporal context for robust maritime obstacle detection","2022","Robust maritime obstacle detection is essential for fully autonomous unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The currently widely adopted segmentation-based obstacle detection methods are prone to misclassification of object reflections and sun glitter as obstacles, producing many false positive detections, effectively rendering the methods impractical for USV navigation. However, water-turbulence-induced temporal appearance changes on object reflections are very distinctive from the appearance dynamics of true objects. We harness this property to design WaSR-T, a novel maritime obstacle detection network, that extracts the temporal context from a sequence of recent frames to reduce ambiguity. By learning the local temporal characteristics of object reflection on the water surface, WaSR-T substantially improves obstacle detection accuracy in the presence of reflections and glitter. Compared with existing single-frame methods, WaSR-T reduces the number of false positive detections by 41% overall and by over 53% within the danger zone of the boat, while preserving a high recall, and achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MODS maritime obstacle detection benchmark.

Then it uses the information from other sensors in order to reduce the number of generated proposals by SS and find more dense proposals. Finally, the class of objects within the final proposals are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

"chemical and radiological detection using uavâ€™s with atex compliance: proof of concept in port and maritime incident-based scenarios","2018","Nowadays, oceans represent a very important part of our economies, as ways of communication between countries and because of the resources they contain, making their safety and protection major concerns that we all face. Because of this, there are several threats which must be dealt with. One of these threats are the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) agents. In this framework, the development of technologies with the potential to increase the capabilities for detection of pollutants or toxic materials and situational awareness plays a significant role in the case of events in the scope of maritime accidents, pollution or port safety and security. These scenarios can pose substantial challenges to the operations, due to their complexity, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is increasingly becoming ubiquitous in this context. This paper is focused in operation environment demonstrations, which aimed to validate the operational feasibility of the concept simulating two different scenarios; chemical and radiological. The selected scenarios were chosen on a risk probability analysis, being very approximate to a real-life incident. This system was tested, and the validation tests are also represented.

"distribution of sulfur aerosol precursors in the spcz released by continuous volcanic degassing at ambrym, vanuatu","2016","The Melanesian Volcanic Arc (MVA) emits about 12kTd−1 of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the atmosphere from continuous passive (non-explosive) volcanic degassing, which contributes 20% of the global SO2 emission from volcanoes. Here we assess, from up-to-date and long-term observations, the SO2 emission of the Ambrym volcano, one of the dominant volcanoes in the MVA, and we investigate its role as sulfate precursor on the regional distribution of aerosols, using both satellite observations and model results at 1°×1° spatial resolution from WRF-Chem/GOCART. Without considering aerosol forcing on clouds, our model parameterizations for convection, vertical mixing and cloud properties provide a reliable chemical weather representation, making possible a cross-examination of model solution and observations. This preliminary work enables the identification of biases and limitations affecting both the model (missing sources) and satellite sensors and algorithms (for aerosol detection and classification) and leads to the implementation of improved transport and aerosol processes in the modeling system. On the one hand, the model confirms a 50% underestimation of SO2 emissions due to satellite swath sampling of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), consistent with field studies. The OMI irregular sampling also produces a level of noise that impairs its monitoring capacity during short-term volcanic events. On the other hand, the model reveals a large sensitivity on aerosol composition and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) due to choices of both the source function in WRF-Chem and size parameters for sea-salt in FlexAOD, the post-processor used to compute offline the simulated AOD. We then proceed to diagnosing the role of SO2 volcanic emission in the regional aerosol composition. The model shows that both dynamics and cloud properties associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) have a large influence on the oxidation of SO2 and on the transport pathways of volcanic species across the South Pacific atmosphere. For example, in the tropical cloudy air, the sulfate production in the aqueous phase is very efficient, resulting in the formation of a large cloud of highly scattering sulfate aerosols advected horizontally to Eastern Indonesia, in agreement with the AOD feature captured by MODIS/Aqua, but missed in CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar) products. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that aerosol re-suspension due to evaporating droplets is a significant pathway for the supply of volcanic sulfur species in the remote marine boundary layer. By strongly modulating the irreversible loss due to wet scavenging, this aerosol process has a similar influence on the sulfur burden as natural emission from volcanoes or biogenic sources like dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The results emphasize the importance of MVA passive degassing and SPCZ dynamics on the aerosol background, and raise questions about potential impacts on the local climate and marine ecosystems.","Volcanic plume impacts,Aerosol modeling,SO dispersal,SPCZ dynamics,Remote sensing,Regional aerosol climatology,"
"differential feature based hierarchical pca fault detection method for dynamic fault","2016","By sensor accuracy degradation or unwanted alternating current signals, sensor fault with zero cross point (ZCP) may occur in real systems and conventional data-driven fault detection methods could be invalid. In this regard, this paper proposes a hierarchical principal component analysis (PCA) fault detection method based on the differential features of dynamic faults to detect the fault with ZCPs. The main contribution of this work are as follows: (1) A new differential based feature extraction method is first proposed to well character the dynamic trend of the observation; (2) then, a hierarchical detection criterion is proposed according to the detection ability of each round of PCA anomaly detection; (3) it is convenient to extend the proposed method to other statistical based fault detection techniques whose detection criteria are also a distance defined by fault amplitude.","Hierarchical PCA,Differential feature,Zero cross point,Dynamic fault,"
"an improved method for retrieving aerosol optical depth over ebinur lake basin from gaofen-1","2023","Lake Ebinur is the largest saltwater lake in Xinjiang. In recent years, the exposed dry lake bottom surface has become a remarkable source of salt and dust owing to the desiccation of the lake. Given the importance of the lake basin to human livelihoods, comprehensive monitoring of basin behavior is required. Remote sensing offers numerous novel approaches to monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols. During this study, high spatial resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) inversion at Lake Ebinur was still in the gap stage. The wide-field-of-view (WFV) data from four cameras on the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite, launched by China in April 2013, offers high spatial and temporal resolution and excellent potential for AOD estimation. Owing to the shortwave infrared band (SWIR) deficiency and the complexity of surface reflectance, the coefficient of variation (CV) was proposed as a measure of surface reflectance to develop a surface reflectance database for land cover characteristics in the Ebinur Lake Basin. The significant improvements of the algorithm include (1) the design of an accurate and universal cloud detection algorithm through the blue and red bands. (2) The CV was used to assess the robustness of surface reflectance under long time series. After dividing the surface reflectance image pixels with low robustness, a reasonable value was assigned according to the surface reflectance variation characteristics of the image pixels. (3) Aerosol models were determined from the long-term measurements of the CIMEL solar photometer (CE318), and the validation of ground-based observations showed good correlation that WFV/GF-1 AOD was comparable to CE318 AOD (R = 0.705; root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.098; mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.078), and the smaller MAE and RMSE confirmed the feasibility of inversion of AOD by this method.","Aerosol pollution,Gaofen-1,Aerosol optical depth,Lake Ebinur,"
"visual drone detection and tracking for autonomous operation from maritime vessel","2022","To allow incorporation of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's/drones) into maritime military operations, it is critical to be able to accurately localize the UAV with respect to the moving maritime vessel during the take-off and landing phases.

"outlier detection approach for discovering anomalous maritime profiles","2023","Maritime authorities play a key role in ensuring the safety and security of shipping lanes and ports. The port state control mechanism enables these authorities to physically verify suspect vessels (e.g., involved in smuggling or piracy events), but choosing the most relevant vessels to be inspected represents a challenging task. This decision can be enhanced by AI-powered systems that analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and report all observed discrepancies. This paper presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region (Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone) in 2022.

We focus in particular on the problem of detecting subtle anomalies in a behaviourally heterogeneous surveillance scene. To reach this goal we implement a novel unsupervised context-aware process. We propose and evaluate a method of utilising social context and scene context to improve behaviour analysis. We find that in a crowded scene the application of Mutual Information based social context permits the ability to prevent self-justifying groups and propagate anomalies in a social network, granting a greater anomaly detection capability. Scene context uniformly improves the detection of anomalies in both datasets. The strength of our contextual features is demonstrated by the detection of subtly abnormal behaviours, which otherwise remain indistinguishable from normal behaviour.","Behaviour analysis,Context,Visual surveillance,Security,"

The constantly refined models, resulting from concurrent incremental learning, are used to evaluate the behavior patterns of vessels based on their present motion states. At the event level, learning provides the capability to detect (and alert) upon anomalous behavior. At a higher (inter-event) level, learning enables predictions, over pre-defined time horizons, to be made about future vessel location. Predictions can also be used to alert on anomalous behavior.

"conflict detection method based on dynamic ship domain model for visualization of collision risk hot-spots","2021","Ship collisions have occurred frequently in the past few decades due to the significant increase in traffic volume. In view of their severe consequences, it is of practical significance to identify the ship encounter scenarios with collision potentials for the waters with high traffic density. In this paper, a systematic methodology is proposed to detect possible collision scenarios and identify the distributions of collision risk Hot-Spots in a given area. A dynamic ship domain model that considers the preferences of navigators with respect to the distance passing with other ships before and after the collision avoidance action is first built as the basis of conflict detection modelling. Then a ship domain-based conflict severity model is established to evaluate the risk levels of ships being involved in dangerous encounters. The spatial-temporal pattern mining methods are subsequently extended to identify collision risk Hot-Spots and analyze the collision risk cluster features with time of day. A case study is finally performed using the real AIS data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port area. Results indicate that combining spatial-temporal pattern mining with collision candidate detection is a useful means to identify where the Hot-Spots are and how the risk is distributed in terms of space and time.","Ship domain,Maritime safety,Traffic conflict,Collision risk visualization,AIS data,"
"a neural network-based approach for the detection of heavy precipitation using gnss observations and surface meteorological data","2021","Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in using GNSS observations to detect heavy precipitation. In this study, a neural network-based (NN-based) approach taking seven meteorological variables as input data was developed based on the back propagation (BP) algorithm for detecting heavy precipitation. Apart from the surface meteorological variables of temperature, pressure and relative humidity, the model has also adopted other information such as day-of-year, hour-of-day and GNSS-derived zenith total delay and precipitable water vapor (PWV) as input variables. The feasibility of using these variables for developing the BP-NN-based model was elaborated by conducting the feature analysis of the seven input variables. In addition, the criterion for selecting a proper size of training sample was also briefly investigated by studying the impact and sensibility of the sample lengths in the model. The proposed model was developed using a sample size of an 8-year (2010–2017) period in the summer at a pair of co-located GNSS/weather stations−HKSC-KP in Hong Kong. The use of a long-term data is to “reliably” capture the characteristics of the selected variables. The detection results for the summer months in 2018 and 2019 were then compared against corresponding precipitation records to valid the effectiveness of the newly proposed model. Results of the correct detection and false alarm rates were 94.5 % and 20.8 %, respectively, which were significant improvements compared with the existing models.","Neural network,Zenith total delay (ZTD),Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS),Precipitable water vapor (PWV),Heavy precipitation detection,"
"satellite radar altimetry water elevations performance over a 200m wide river: evaluation over the garonne river","2017","For at least 20 years, nadir altimetry satellite missions have been successfully used to first monitor the surface elevation of oceans and, shortly after, of large rivers and lakes. For the last 5–10 years, few studies have demonstrated the possibility to also observe smaller water bodies than previously thought feasible (river smaller than 500m wide and lake below 10km2). The present study aims at quantifying the nadir altimetry performance over a medium river (200m or lower wide) with a pluvio-nival regime in a temperate climate (the Garonne River, France). Three altimetry missions have been considered: ENVISAT (from 2002 to 2010), Jason-2 (from 2008 to 2014) and SARAL (from 2013 to 2014). Compared to nearby in situ gages, ENVISAT and Jason-2 observations over the lower Garonne River mainstream (110 km upstream of the estuary) have the smallest errors, with water elevation anomalies root mean square errors (RMSE) around 50cm and 20cm, respectively. The few ENVISAT upstream measurements have RMSE ranging from 80cm to 160cm. Over the estuary, ENVISAT and SARAL water elevation anomalies RMSE are around 30cm and 10cm, respectively. The most recent altimetry mission, SARAL, does not provide river elevation measurements for most satellite overflights of the river mainstream. The altimeter remains “locked” on the top of surrounding hilly areas and does not observe the steep-sided river valley, which could be 50–100m lower. This phenomenon is also observed, for fewer dates, on Jason-2 and ENVISAT measurements. In these cases, the measurement is not “erroneous”, it just does not correspond to water elevation of the river that is covered by the satellite. ENVISAT is less prone to get ‘locked’ on the top of the topography due to some differences in the instrument measurement parameters, trading lower accuracy for more useful measurements. Such problems are specific to continental surfaces (or near the coasts), but are not observed over the open oceans, which are flatter. To overcome this issue, an experimental instrument operating mode, called the DIODE/DEM tracking mode, has been developed by CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) and has been tested during few Jason-2 cycles and during the first SARAL/AltiKA cycle. This tracking mode “forces” the instrument to observe a target of interest, i.e. water bodies. The example of the Garonne River shows, for one SARAL ground track, the benefit of the DIODE/DEM tracking mode for a steep-sided river reach, which is not detected using the nominal instrument operating mode. Yet, this mode relies on ancillary datasets (a priori global DEM and global land/water mask), which are critical to obtain river valley observation. The ultimately computed elevations along the satellite tracks, loaded on board, should have an absolute vertical accuracy around 10m (or better). This case also shows, when the instrument is correctly observing the river valley, that the altimeter can detect water bodies narrower than 100m (like an artificial canal). In agreement with recent studies, this work shows that altimeter missions can provide useful water elevation measurements over a 200m wide river with RMSE as low as 50cm and 20cm, for ENVISAT and Jason-2 respectively. The seasonal cycle can be observed with the temporal sampling of these missions (35 days and 10 days, respectively), but short term events, like flood events, are most of the time not observed. It also illustrates that altimeter capability to observe a river is highly dependent of the surrounding topography, the observation configuration, previous measurements and the instrument design. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize at global scale the minimum river width that could be seen by altimeters. This study analyzes, for the first time, the potential of the experimental DIODE/DEM tracking mode to observe steep-sided narrow river valleys, which are frequently missed with nominal tracking mode. For such case, using the DIODE/DEM mode could provide water elevation measurements, as long as the on board DEM is accurate enough. This mode should provide many more valid measurements over steep-sided rivers than currently observed.","SARAL,Garonne River,DIODE/DEM mode,Satellite altimetry,ENVISAT,Jason-2,"
"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks with the same hyper-parameters with no domain specific design.","Benchmark testing,anomalous objects,road anomaly detection,Feature extraction,detection of anomalies as consistent unpredictable patches,Design methodology,Filtering,nearest-neighbour manner,nonanomalous objects,object detection,feature extraction,multimodal known class appearance,inpainting module,autonomous driving,domain specific design,nearest neighbour methods,Roads,image-consistent detection,mobile robots,image restoration,DaCUP,Task analysis,auto-encoder,Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection,obstacle avoidance,Computer vision,road vehicles,categorization,image-conditioned distance features,class identification,segmentation),"

"multimodal sensor fusion for robust obstacle detection and classification in the maritime robotx challenge","2019","This paper describes a novel probabilistic sensor fusion framework aimed at improving obstacle detection accuracy and classification of various targets experienced in the Maritime RobotX Challenge. In both the 2014 and 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenges, it was found that detecting obstacles using LIDAR only and classifying obstacles using vision only can be challenged by environmental conditions, such as glare from the sun or by objects such as the spherical black buoys from the obstacle field that disperses LIDAR rays. In this paper, a new multimodal sensor fusion approach is proposed that combines data streams from perception sensors, such as LIDAR, RADAR, and cameras, to improve the robustness of detection and classification performance over a single sensor method. Using data collected from both the 2014 and 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenges, an evaluation of the perception framework is provided.

"a novel analytic framework of real-time multi-vessel collision risk assessment for maritime traffic surveillance","2017","Multi-vessel collision risk assessment for maritime traffic surveillance is a key technique to ensure the safety and security of maritime traffic and transportation. This paper proposes a framework of real-time multi-vessel collision assessment that combines a spatial clustering process (DBSCAN) for detecting clusters of encounter vessels and a multi-vessel collision risk index model for encounter vessels within each cluster from the large amounts of monitored vessels in a surveyed sea area. First, the vessels monitored are clustered using DBSCAN to obtain the clusters of encounter vessels, filtering out the relatively safe vessels. Then, the dynamic motion relation between encounter vessels within each cluster is modeled to obtain DCPA and TCPA. The semantic and mathematical relationship of vessel collision risk index for each cluster of encounter vessels with DCPA and TCAP is constructed using a negative exponential function. To illustrate the effectiveness of the framework proposed, an experimental case study has been carried out within the west coastal waters of Sweden. The results show that our framework is effective and efficient at detecting and ranking collision risk indexes between encounter vessels within each cluster, which allows an automatic risk prioritization of encounter vessels for further investigation by operators. Hence, this framework can improve the safety and security of vessel traffic transportation and reduce the loss of lives and property.","Maritime surveillance,Collision risk index,Vessel traffic,Maritime transportation,AIS,"
"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems. Sri Lanka Navy has myriad of surveillance information sources such as AIS (Automatic Identification System), RADAR (Radio Aid Detection and Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging), MSTT, HFSWR, AVL (Automatic Vessel Locating), HF Communication, Intelligence Data ect. So it is obvious that an information fusion methodology is needed to harness the effectiveness of multiple sensor information. An object identification pipeline is conceptualized such that an unknown object in the maritime domain is detected reducing the uncertainty of obtained information. The radical new virtual reality application has been developed to visualize the information fused from sensors and discussed in depth in addition to the introduction of the fusion process. The technologies used in developing the virtual world and incorporating the real time information in to the virtual world is presented in simplified modal for the purpose of clarity.

"maritime anomaly detection using gaussian process active learning","2012","A model of normal vessel behaviours is useful for detecting illegal, suspicious, or unsafe behaviour; such as vessel theft, drugs smuggling, people trafficking or poor sailing. This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom.

"modeling the distribution of illicit oily discharges detected by aerial surveillance in western canadian marine waters","2014","Oily discharges from vessel operations have been documented in Canada’s Pacific region by the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) since the early 1990s. We explored a number of regression methods to explain the distribution and counts per grid cell of oily discharges detected from 1998 to 2007 using independent predictor variables, while trying to address the large number of zeros present in the data. Best-fit models indicate that discharges are generally concentrated close to shore typically in association with small harbours, and with major commercial and tourist centers. Oily discharges were also concentrated in Barkley Sound and at the entrance of Juan de Fuca Strait. The identification of important factors associated with discharge patterns, and predicting discharge rates in areas with surveillance effort can be used to inform future surveillance. Model output can also be used as inputs for risk models for existing conditions and as baseline for future scenarios.","Chronic oil pollution,Aerial surveillance,Zero-inflated models,Marine pollution,Canadian West Coast,Detection,"
"deployment and optimization of multi-uav-assisted maritime internet of things for waterway data collection","2021","Maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) is regarded as one of the important paradigms to realize the Smart Ocean.

"natural and anthropogenic submarine morphologies revealed by high resolution acoustic data in the gulf of izmir, western turkey","2016","This study includes the interpretation of submarine morphological structures using the multibeam echo sounder bathymetry and CHIRP high resolution seismic in the Gulf of Izmir. The faults as the indicator of active tectonics, submarine channels, gas seeps, active and inactive pockmarks are the main natural morphological features in the gulf. Additionally, man-made (anthropogenic) structures like navigation channels, excavation debrises and ships wrecks are also observed. Geomorphological development of the gulf is controlled by the active faults in the Neotectonic period. Therefore, detection of active faults is very critical for the morphology of the gulf where many faults with different orientations have been interpreted on the seismic data. In the central-outer part of the gulf to the W NW, there are some normal faults trending in the N NW and S SE direction, and in the eastern and southern part of the gulf, E–W trending normal faults are evident in the seabed topography. The water depth increases from the eastern (inner) to the outer section of the gulf in the W NW direction. The N NE margin and the coastal area are very shallow (<25 m) because of the Quaternary deltaic sediment influx from the Gediz River. There are several biogenic, shallow gas accumulations in and around the delta of this river. In addition, many active and inactive pockmarks and gas seeps are also observed in the delta sediments and near the active faults as evidence of hydrocarbon generation and seepage.","Gulf of Izmir,Gediz Delta,Uzunada Fault Zone,Chirp,Multibeam echo sounder,"

"a novel online multi-task learning for covid-19 multi-output spatio-temporal prediction","2023","In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, predicting its trend would significantly impact decision-making. However, this is not a straightforward task due to three main difficulties: temporal autocorrelation, spatial dependency, and concept drift caused by virus mutations and lockdown policies. Although machine learning has been extensively used in related work, no previous research has successfully addressed all three challenges simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel online multi-task regression algorithm that incorporates a chain structure to capture spatial dependency, the ADWIN drift detector to adapt to concept drift, and the lag time series feature to capture temporal autocorrelation. We conducted several comparative experiments based on the number of daily confirmed cases in 20 areas in California and affiliated cities. The results from our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is superior in adapting to concept drift in COVID-19 data and capturing spatial dependencies across various regions.

"chapter 56 - tin","2015","Inorganic tin compounds occur naturally in the Earth’s crust. In the environment, tin can be found in both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic tin compounds are released from natural and anthropogenic sources. The conversion of metallic tin forms to compounds that may be more soluble increases the risk of exposure and toxicity. Organotin compounds in the environment largely originate from anthropogenic activities. However, chemical and biochemical methylation reactions convert inorganic tin compounds into methyltin form. Biomethylation of alkyltins results in the accumulation of more toxic organotin compounds. Tin is not regarded an essential nutrient for humans. However, tin is considered an essential for the growth of rats, with a requirement for tin of between 1 and 2mg/kg in the diet. Elemental tin, inorganic tin compounds, and long-chain alkyltins are poorly absorbed when ingested, which accounts for their relatively low toxicity. The toxicity of organotin compounds depends on the length of alkyl chain, hydrophobicity, and other physicochemical properties. Hydrophobic organotins are toxic to a wide variety of organisms owing to their high solubility in cell membranes. The alkyl tins are more toxic than the aryl tins, whereas the toxicity of short-chain alkyltin compounds such as trimethyl- and triethyltin is higher than that of long-chain compounds: toxicity increases with number of alkyl groups. The excretory routes of tin compounds may vary depending of the type of compounds and the mode of exposure. Insoluble inorganic tin compounds are largely nontoxic. However, inhalation of tin dust results in its deposition in lungs and may cause “stannosis,” a benign pneumoconiosis. Some tin salts are irritating or can liberate toxic fumes during decomposition. Gastrointestinal absorption of soluble tin salts is only a few percent of the ingested dose. In chronic exposure, tin tends to accumulate in kidney, liver, and bones. Bones comprise a major site of deposition of tin after long-term exposure and intramuscular injection. The biological half-life of tin in bone is approximately 100 days. Exposure to high concentrations of inorganic tin may cause gastrointestinal illness, as well as liver and kidney problems. No noteworthy histopathological observations of nonneoplastic nature were reported in a long-term study. Short-chain alkyls are easily absorbed from gastrointestinal tract. Some alkyltin compounds, particularly tributyltin and triphenyltin, have high toxicity. Chronic exposure to butyltin compounds causes imposex, a pathological condition characterized by development of male sex characteristics in female gastropods. Toxicity of organotins in humans is most frequently reported as loss of memory and seizure, as well as other symptoms including death. Short-chain alkyltin, particularly the trialkyl derivatives, and aromatic tin compounds are neurotoxic. Hydrophobic trimethyltin and triethyltin compounds readily diffuse into richly lipophilic tissues such as brain and cause encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and severe seizures. Tetraalkyltins are enzymatically converted to the trisubstituted form and exert delayed but similar neurotoxic effects. Tributyltin compounds are less toxic than trimethyl- and triethyltins. They may be strongly irritating to the skin in humans. It was reported that shipyard workers exposed to tributyltin oxide developed severe dermatitis, difficulty in breathing, and flu-like symptoms. Trisubstituted organotin derivatives are implicated in hepatotoxicity, immunodeficiency, endocrine disruption, and both reproductive anomalies and infertility in laboratory animals. Monobutyltin and dibutyltin show genotoxicity, while mono- and dimethyltin are not genotoxic. Organotin compounds penetrate the cell membrane and interrupt oxidative phosphorylation, disturb calcium homeostasis, damage mitochondria, and induce apoptosis.","biocompatibility,detection methods,mechanism of toxicity,metabolism,organotins,risk assessment,tin,environment,"

"improved tropical deep convective cloud detection using modis observations with an active sensor trained machine learning algorithm","2023","Tropical deep convective clouds (DCCs) play an essential role in the Earth system. However, separating DCCs from thick anvils with satellite passive measurements is challenging. In this work, a day/night unified tropical DCC detection approach for MODIS observations is developed with a CloudSat active sensor measurement trained machine learning model. This approach combines brightness temperatures (BTs) at 6.7 μm (BT6.7) and 11 μm (BT11) with derived variables describing horizontal structures of DCCs and improves the tropical DCC probability of detection (POD) from 45.0% for the widely-used BT11 < 215 K method to 67.9%, while the false alarm ratio (FAR) decreases from 43.9% to 32.6%. The Heidke skill score (HSS) of the new algorithm is 0.425, which is more than doubled compared to the HSS of the BT11 < 215 K method (0.182). Moreover, the new algorithm has small biases in DCC's total amount and spatial distribution compared with the CloudSat results. The monthly DCC variations from MODIS wide-swath measurements with the new algorithm demonstrate the ability to reliably provide high temporal and spatial resolution DCC distributions to support intra-seasonal to interannual climate variability studies, which the CloudSat narrow-swath measurements lack enough samples to do. Meanwhile, the new algorithm can also be applied to measurements from other satellite passive sensors when BT6.7 and BT11 are available.","Passive measurements,Tropical convective cloud detection,CloudSat,Horizontal structure,CALIPSO,Machine learning,MODIS,"
"dissecting uncertainty-based fusion techniques for maritime anomaly detection","2015","Detecting and classifying anomalies for Maritime Situation Awareness gets a lot of benefit from the combination of multiple sources, correlating their output for detecting inconsistencies in vessels' behaviour. Adequate uncertainty representation and processing is crucial for this higher-level task where the operator analyses information correlating with his background knowledge. This paper addresses the problem of performance criteria selection and definition for information fusion systems in their ability to handle uncertainty. Indeed, i addition to the classical algorithmic performances of accuracy or timeliness, other aspects such as the interpretation, simplicity, expressiveness need to be considered in the design of the technique for uncertainty management for a improved synergy between the human and the system. In this paper, we dissect several uncertainty representation and reasoning techniques (URRTs) addressing a fusion problem for maritime anomaly detection. The uncertainty supports are identified as a basis for the global expressiveness criterion. A selection of six elementary URRTs are described and compared according to their expressiveness power of uncertainty, using the Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Framework (URREF) ontology.

"feasibility evaluation for development of composite propellers with embedded piezoelectric sensors","2022","Marine propellers made of fibre-reinforced composites have demonstrated the potential to outperform metallic propellers in terms of efficiency and under-water noise radiation. For full realisation of this potential in a tailored design process with realistic constraints, accurate information on the hydrodynamic loads acting on composite marine propellers and the structural integrity is of key importance. It is conceptualised that this information can be acquired without disturbing propeller hydrodynamics using a network of piezoelectric sensors embedded inside the blade. In this paper, feasibility of this concept has been investigated numerically and experimentally. Hydrodynamic loads on a composite propeller obtained from numerical simulations were used to assess the sensitivity of piezoelectric sensors in measuring the dynamic strain field due to the blade deformation. Subsequently, 25 small-scale carbon-epoxy composite samples were manufactured with embedded piezoelectric wafer sensors of different sizes, and subjected to non-destructive and destructive loading scenarios. Feasibility of measuring strains at different frequency ranges and damage-induced acoustic emissions was quantitatively assessed from these experiments. Furthermore, the influence of the embedded sensors on the ultimate strength and toughness of the specimens was investigated. It was found that at least 92% of the studied propeller blade would have dynamic strains measurable up to the first four harmonics by the considered piezoelectric sensors. In a four-point bending setup, it was additionally demonstrated that the embedded piezoelectric sensor captured damage-induced acoustic emissions up to specimen failure with an average signal to noise ratio of 17 dB. The results indicate that embedded piezoelectric sensor networks can have the capability to measure both low-frequency dynamic strains in composite marine propeller blades and damage-related acoustic emissions.","Embedded sensors,Dynamic strain measurement,Piezoelectric sensors,Composite marine propeller,Acoustic emission,Damage detection,"
"edge computing-enabled multi-sensor data fusion for intelligent surveillance in maritime transportation systems","2022","With the rapid development of navigation technologies, maritime transportation has become one of the mainstream international trade channels. However, a large number of maritime traffic accidents still occur every year, which cause significant economic losses and environmental damage. Intelligent and efficient surveillance in maritime transportation systems is essential for avoiding accidents. This paper proposes an edge computing-enabled multi-sensor data fusion method for intelligent maritime surveillance, which achieves efficient perception of maritime traffic information by receiving and processing visual and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data simultaneously. We first propose an anti-occlusion algorithm for vessel tracking based on visual trajectory analysis to mitigate missing detection caused by overlapping vessels. We then leverage the Hungarian algorithm driven by multidimensional feature analysis to match data collected by different sensors. The matched AIS information is eventually fused into the visual target of interest. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can achieve effective information perception in different maritime environments with 91.67% accuracy and superior robustness.","Image edge detection,marine accidents,surveillance,intelligent maritime surveillance,anti-occlusion tracking,Transportation,Prediction algorithms,maritime transportation systems,data fusion,multi-sensor data fusion,Hungarian algorithm,Intelligent maritime surveillance,vessel trajectory prediction,vessel tracking,object tracking,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,visual trajectory analysis,AIS,anti-occlusion algorithm,maritime environments,maritime traffic accidents,edge computing,multisensor data fusion,maritime traffic information,Data integration,Visualization,Navigation,Surveillance,distributed processing,"
"development of a spectrum-based ship fuel sulfur content real-time evaluation method","2023","Although maritime transport plays an essential role in the global economy, it inevitably imposes negative impacts on our living environment, especially for ships using fuel with high sulfur content. Nowadays, ship emission monitoring highly depends on manual inspection, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study proposes a decision framework based on spectrum technology and the sulfur‑carbon ratio method to measure the ship fuel sulfur content. Specifically, after the Gaussian plume model optimization from four aspects, a multistep-based emission contribution evaluation method is developed to improve the evaluation accuracy. The proposed framework is validated by a suspected ship and a series of exempted ships from the Maritime Safety Administration in Nanjing, China. The validation results imply that the proposed framework has a certain enhancement in detection rate, evaluation accuracy and extensibility. It may provide an efficient and accurate supervision approach for the Maritime Safety Administration on ship fuel sulfur content measurement.","Fuel sulfur content,Differential optical absorption spectrum,Remote sensing,Ship emission,Improved Gaussian plume model,"

"from unsupervised to semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for hrrp targets","2020","Responding to the challenge of detecting unusual radar targets in a well identified environment, innovative anomaly and novelty detection methods keep emerging in the literature. This work aims at presenting a benchmark gathering common and recently introduced unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, the results being generated using high-resolution range profiles. A semi-supervised AD (SAD) is considered to demonstrate the added value of having a few labeled anomalies to improve performances. Experiments were conducted with and without pollution of the training set with anomalous samples in order to be as close as possible to real operational contexts. The common AD methods composing our baseline will be One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The more innovative AD methods put forward by this work are Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD) and Random Projection Depth (RPD), belonging respectively to deep and shallow AD.

"securing iot based maritime transportation system through entropy-based dual-stack machine learning framework","2023","Internet of Things (IoTs) is envisaged to widely capture the realm of logistics and transportation services in future. The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named â€œDual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)â€ has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs). The proposed S2ML technique outperforms prevalent ones with 1.5% better results compared to asserted approaches on distribution of normal/attack traffic.

"chapter 5 - time series analysis methods","2014","This chapter covers all aspects of time series analysis. In this latest edition, the material has been reorganized so that it now starts with basic concepts regarding stochastic processes and introduces correlation functions as the first step toward defining spectral analysis. We examine the application of spectral analysis to stochastic series and discrete series, and provide a thorough treatment of traditional spectral methods. The chi-squared property of spectral estimates is introduced and discussed as a means of evaluating the statistical significance of spectral estimates. Spectral methods for vector series are briefly discussed, as are rotary spectral estimation methods. The effects of temporal or spatial sampling on the resultant spectral estimates are explored and the resultant aliasing is introduced and discussed, as are the implications for frequency resolution. The smoothing of spectral estimates, or windowing, is described and the implications of window selection on the significance of spectral estimates are examined. Simple band averaging is discussed as a smoothing method and the resultant confidence intervals for the spectrum are introduced. The concepts of spectral fidelity and stability are discussed as outcomes of smoothing decisions. The needs for zero padding and prewhitening are then introduced. Next the spectral analysis of unevenly spaced series is a unique topic of this chapter. It also provides a summary of the standard spectral analysis approach. The discussion then shifts to parametric methods of spectral analysis starting with autoregressive power spectral estimation. The maximum entropy spectral method is then introduced along with maximum likelihood spectral estimation. Next is cross-spectral analysis, where we no longer have strict power spectra but must deal with coherence and phase. The Fourier transform method is introduced and the practical applications of this method are detailed. Phase and cross-amplitude functions are discussed along with co- and quadrature spectra. The unique aspects of confidence levels to cross-spectra are then introduced. The frequency response of a linear system is described, along with rotary cross-spectra. Wavelet analysis is subsequently introduced as an alternative to standard spectral methods. Various wavelet algorithms are examined relative to their advantages and disadvantages. Oceanographic examples are presented to show how wavelet analysis can be used. In addition to wavelets the S-transform is discussed along with the multiple filter technique developed by geophysicists. Basic Fourier spectral analysis is then introduced to take advantage of the popular Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) now possible with digital computing facilities. FFT applications to both discrete and continuous time/space series are discussed and detailed. A least-squares FFT method is introduced again as a way of handling gappy time/space series. Computational examples are included with all of these procedures. A discussion of the harmonic analysis as applied to tidal time series is then presented. In earlier editions of this text harmonic analysis was presented before the discussion of spectral methods but the authors now consider harmonic analysis as a subset of the larger spectral analysis and hence it comes later. Computational tidal examples are included here. Special time series methods such as “regime shift detection” (including “sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts,” “adaptive Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filters,” and “cumulative upwelling index”) are introduced and discussed. Vector regression is also suggested as a time series analysis method. Fractals are suggested as another technique to decompose a time series.","Regime shift detection,Spectral windows,Wavelet analysis,Cross-spectral analysis,Fourier analysis,Tidal analysis,Spectral filters,Aliasing,Spectral smoothing,Vector regression,FFT,Fractals,Co- and quadrature spectra,Band averaging,Least-squares spectral analysis,Spectral analysis,Harmonic analysis,"
"climate changes and recent glacier behaviour in the chilean lake district","2007","Atmospheric temperatures measured at the Chilean Lake District (38°–42°S) showed contrasting trends during the second half of the 20th century. The surface cooling detected at several meteorological stations ranged from −0.014 to −0.021 °C a−1, whilst upper troposphere (850–300 gpm) records at radiosonde of Puerto Montt (41°26′S/73°07′W) revealed warming between 0.019 and 0.031 °C a−1. Regional rainfall data collected from 1961 to 2000 showed the overall decrease with a maximum rate of −15 mm a−2 at Valdivia st. (39°38′S/73°05′W). These ongoing climatic changes, especially the precipitation reduction, seem to be related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena which has been more frequent after 1976. Glaciers within the Chilean Lake District have significantly retreated during recent decades, in an apparent out-of-phase response to the regional surface cooling. Moreover, very little is known about upper troposphere changes and how they can enhance the glacier responses. In order to analyse their behaviour in the context of the observed climate changes, Casa Pangue glacier (41°08′S/71°52′W) has been selected and studied by comparing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) computed at three different dates throughout the last four decades. This approach allowed the determination of ice elevation changes between 1961 and 1998, yielding a mean thinning rate of −2.3±0.6 m a−1. Strikingly, when ice thinning is computed for the period between 1981 and 1998, the resulting rate is 50% higher (−3.6±0.6 m a−1). This enhanced trend and the related area loss and frontal retreat suggests that Casa Pangue might currently be suffering negative mass balances in response to the upper troposphere warming and decreased precipitation of the last 25–30 yr, as well as debris cover would not prevent the glacier from a fast reaction to climate forcing. Most of recent glaciological studies regarding Andean glaciers have concentrated on low altitude changes, namely frontal variations, however, in order to better understand the regional glacier changes, new data are necessary, especially from the accumulation areas.","glacier fluctuations,ENSO,ice thinning,Chilean Lake District,climate change,"
"manifold learning techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection","2018","Appropriately identifying outlier data is a critical requirement in the decision-making process of many expert and intelligent systems deployed in a variety of fields including finance, medicine, and defense. Classical outlier detection schemes typically rely on the assumption that normal/background data of interest are distributed according to an assumed statistical model and search for data that deviate from that assumption. However, it is frequently the case that performance is reduced because the underlying distribution does not follow the assumed model. Manifold learning techniques offer improved performance by learning better models of the background but can be too computationally expensive due to the need to calculate a distance measure between all data points. Here, we study a general framework that allows manifold learning techniques to be used for unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing computational expense via a uniform random sampling of a small fraction of the data. A background manifold is learned from the sample and then an out-of-sample extension is used to project unsampled data into the learned manifold space and construct an anomaly detection statistic based on the prediction error of the learned manifold. The method works well for unsupervised anomaly detection because, by definition, the ratio of anomalous to non-anomalous data points is small and the sampling will be dominated by background points. However, a variety of parameters that affect detection performance are introduced so we use here a low-dimensional toy problem to investigate their effect on the performance of four learning algorithms (kernel PCA, two versions of diffusion map, and the Parzen density estimator). We then apply the methods to the detection of watercraft in an ensemble of 22 infrared maritime scenes where we find kernel PCA to be superior and show that it outperforms a commonly employed baseline algorithm. The framework is not limited to the tested image processing example and can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection task.","Manifolds,Anomaly detection,Image processing,Manifold learning,Target detection,"
"a novel approach for defect detection on vessel structures using saliency-related features","2018","Seagoing vessels have to undergo regular visual inspections in order to detect defects such as cracks and corrosion before they result into catastrophic consequences. These inspections are currently performed manually by ship surveyors at a great cost, so that any level of assistance during the inspection process by means of e.g. a fleet of robots capable of defect detection would significatively decrease the inspection cost. In this paper, we describe a novel framework for visually detecting the aforementioned defects. This framework is generic and flexible in the sense that it can be easily configured to compute the features that perform better for the inspection at hand. Making use of this framework and inspired by the idea of conspicuity, this work considers contrast and symmetry as features for detecting defects and shows their usefulness for the case of vessels. Three different combination operators are additionally tested in order to merge the information provided by these features and improve the detection performance. Experimental results for different configurations of the detection framework show better classification rates than state of the art methods and prove its usability for images collected by a micro-aerial robotic platform intended for visual inspection.","Saliency,Defect detection,Vessel inspection,Micro-aerial vehicle,Corrosion,Cracks,"
"online detection of anomaly behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2020","In the surveillance domain, timely detection of anomaly behaviors is very important and is a great challenge to human operators due to information overload, fatigue and inattention. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on trajectories have been proposed for this problem. However, these algorithms generally have problems such as complex parameter setting, unfaithful statistical model, not well-calibrated false alarm rate, poor ability of online learning and sequential anomaly detection, etc. The theory of conformal prediction was introduced to solve these problems by constructing the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector. Yet, it only considers position information of the targets and is not sensitive to velocity and course anomaly behaviors. And the run times are increasing as the increase of the data size, which is not appropriate for early warning surveillance application. In order to solve these problems, sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNCAD) and sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor inductive conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNICAD) based on multidimensional trajectories are proposed in this paper. Experiments in both simulated military scenario and realistic civilian scenario show the presented algorithm has a good performance to online detect anomaly behaviors and would have a wide prospect in early warning surveillance systems.","Multidimensional,Anomaly behavior,Trajectory,Online detection,"

"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

"texture anomaly detection in radar imagery","1994","A radar image of the land or sea will contain extended regions of apparently homogeneous textures arising from, for example, forested areas or uniformly driven expanses of water. However, such regions may contain subtle texture anomalies which indicate the presence of a feature of interest such as a change in tree density due to environmental effects, damping of the sea surface due to the presence of pollutants or the presence of land-based or maritime military targets. For this reason, it is of interest to develop methods of detecting anomalies in textured regions. A strategy for texture anomaly detection is to estimate the multi-variate probability density function (PDF) of a texture segment using the whole homogeneous region as training data and then to calculate the likelihood of occurrence of each individual segment within the region given the PDF estimate. Those texture segments with anomalous likelihood values can then be flagged as potential texture anomalies.<>","Image texture analysis,radar imagery,PDF estimate,image texture,texture segment,Statistics,statistical analysis,texture anomaly detection,multi-variate probability density,Radar,radar image,texture segments,radar,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"
"a novel technique to identify ais transmissions from vessels which attempt to obscure their position by switching their ais transponder from normal transmit power mode to low transmit power mode","2022","Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are transponder systems installed on marine vessels which transmit the location, speed and other vessel details. These signals are received by shore side AIS Base stations. The use of AIS is mandatory under international SOLAS regulations for certain categories of vessels. AIS is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue (SAR) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their AIS transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their AIS transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with SOLAS regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, AIS transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field (RSSI) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming AIS messages with. The technique presented, analyses received RSSI in combination with predicted RSSI values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National AIS was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in RSSI of approximately 10 dBm (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.","AIS spoofing,Received signal strength indicator,Low transmit power,Sybil attack,Automatic identification system,"
"preliminary analysis of monostatic and bistatic doppler signature of small maritime target","2013","The simultaneous bistatic and monostatic Doppler signatures of a small boat are measured and analyzed. The data was recorded using the UCL NetRAD 2.4 GHz netted radar system. Two datasets are presented: one at small bistatic angle (~ 4Â°) and the other at a larger angle (~ 91Â°). There was little difference between the monostatic and bistatic channels in the former, while there were significant differences in the latter. In addition, by using detections from both channels the true velocity of the target is estimated.","Doppler radar,Boats,signal classification,Educational institutions,monostatic Doppler signature,marine radar,UCL NetRAD,Receivers,frequency 2.4 GHz,bistatic Doppler signature,radar signal processing,small maritime target,small boat signature,netted radar system,Doppler shift,small bistatic angle,boats,"
"developing a predictive maintenance model for vessel machinery","2020","The aim of maintenance is to reduce the number of failures in equipment and to avoid breakdowns that may lead to disruptions during operations. The objective of this study is to initiate the development of a predictive maintenance solution in the shipping industry based on a computational artificial intelligence model using real-time monitoring data. The data analysed originates from the historical values from sensors measuring the vessel´s engines and compressors health and the software used to analyse these data was R. The results demonstrated key parameters held a stronger influence in the overall state of the components and proved in most cases strong correlations amongst sensor data from the same equipment. The results also showed a great potential to serve as inputs for developing a predictive model, yet further elements including failure modes identification, detection of potential failures and asset criticality are some of the issues required to define prior designing the algorithms and a solution based on artificial intelligence. A systematic approach using big data and machine learning as techniques to create predictive maintenance strategies is already creating disruption within the shipping industry, and maritime organizations need to consider how to implement these new technologies into their business operations and to improve the speed and accuracy in their maintenance decision making.","Vessel Machinery,Maintenance in Shipping industry,Big Data Analytics,Sensor Systems,Condition Based Maintenance,Predictive Maintenance,Sensor Data,"

Our objectives aimed at improving, automating, and enriching these previous methods. This was to operationally produce over the whole Landes Forest not only (1) the annual maps of clear-cutting from 1984 up the current year but also (2) the map of the current age that was derived from the forest change detected every year since 1984. The developed methodology used the time-series of surface reflectance and cloud mask provided for Landsat by USGS and sought to cope the possible absence of cloud-free image during the interest season or the numerous missing data in Landsat 7 images after 2002.

"machine learning-assisted anomaly detection in maritime navigation using ais data","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) reports vessels' static and dynamic information, which are essential for maritime traffic situation awareness. However, AIS transponders can be switched off to hide suspicious activities, such as illegal fishing, or piracy. Therefore, this paper uses real world AIS data to analyze the possibility of successful detection of various anomalies in the maritime domain. We propose a multi-class artificial neural network (ANN)-based anomaly detection framework to classify intentional and non-intentional AIS on-off switching anomalies. The multi-class anomaly framework captures AIS message dropouts due to various reasons, e.g., channel effects or intentional one for carrying illegal activities. We extract position, speed, course and timing information from real world AIS data, and use them to train a 2-class (normal and anomaly) and a 3-class (normal, power outage and anomaly) anomaly detection models. Our results show that the models achieve around 99.9% overall accuracy, and are able to classify a test sample in the order of microseconds.","security of data,maritime traffic situation awareness,multiclass anomaly framework,pattern classification,multiclass artificial neural network,AIS message dropouts,neural nets,illegal fishing,learning (artificial intelligence),illegal activities,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,machine learning-assisted anomaly detection,maritime navigation,AIS transponders,"

Here, the viability of water column monitoring for the detection of the injected CO2 is evaluated. Real-time pH and pCO2 measurements were taken in the water column during the CO2 release experiment. Monitoring was carried out throughout the full water column, from the near-seafloor to the sea surface, in order to assess the spatial extent of the CO2 release. The dispersion of the CO2 plume was strongly influenced by tidal circulation in the area. The strongest signals were detected within 8 m of the bubble stream during low tide. The lowest pH and highest pCO2 values were 7.965 and 942.1 µatm, respectively, corresponding to variations of 16.4% [H+] and 125.6% from baseline values. The pCO2 baseline dynamics of Goldeneye area were assessed by the evaluation of the natural pCO2-O2 covariance.

"interactive visualization of normal behavioral models and expert rules for maritime anomaly detection","2009","Maritime surveillance systems analyze vast amounts of heterogeneous sensor data from a large number of objects. In order to support the operator while monitoring such systems, the identification of anomalous vessels or situations that might need further investigation may reduce the operator's cognitive load. While it is worth acknowledging that many existing mining applications support identification of anomalous behavior, autonomous anomaly detection systems are rarely used in the real world, since the detection of anomalous behavior is normally not a well-defined problem and therefore, human expert knowledge is needed. This calls for the development of interaction components that can support the user in the detection process. In order to support the comprehension of the knowledge embedded in the system, we propose an interactive way of visualizing expert rules and normal behavioral models built from the data.

"a mec-iiot intelligent threat detector based on machine learning boosted tree algorithms","2023","In recent years, new management methods have appeared that mark the beginning of a new industrial revolution called Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IIoT brings together new emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML), that contribute to new applications, industrial processes and efficiency management in factories. This combination of new technologies and contexts is paired with Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) to reduce costs through the virtualisation of networks and services. As these new paradigms increase in growth, so does the number of threats and vulnerabilities, making IIoT a very desirable target for cybercriminals. In addition, IIoT devices have certain intrinsic limitations, especially due to their limited resources, and this makes it impossible, in many cases, to detect attacks by using solutions designed for other paradigms. So it is necessary to design, implement and evaluate new solutions or adapt existing ones. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent threat detector based on boosted tree algorithms. Such detectors have been implemented and evaluated in an environment specifically designed to test IIoT deployments. In this way, we can learn how these algorithms, which have been successful in multiple contexts, behave in a paradigm with known constraints. The results obtained in the study show that our intelligent threat detector achieves a mean efficiency of between 95%–99% in the F1 Score metric, indicating that it is a good option for implementation in these scenarios.","Industrial Internet of Things,Multi-access Edge Computing,Machine Learning,Intrusion detection system,Cybersecurity,"
"unsupervised anomaly detection for underwater gliders using generative adversarial networks","2021","An effective anomaly detection system is critical for marine autonomous systems operating in complex and dynamic marine environments to reduce operational costs and achieve concurrent large-scale fleet deployments. However, developing an automated fault detection system remains challenging for several reasons including limited data transmission via satellite services. Currently, most anomaly detection for marine autonomous systems, such as underwater gliders, rely on intensive analysis by pilots. This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection system using bidirectional generative adversarial networks guided by assistive hints for marine autonomous systems with time series data collected by multiple sensors. In this study, the anomaly detection system for a fleet of underwater gliders is trained on two healthy deployment datasets and tested on other nine deployment datasets collected by a selection of vehicles operating in a range of locations and environmental conditions. The system is successfully applied to detect anomalies in the nine test deployments, which include several different types of anomalies as well as healthy behaviour. Also, a sensitivity study of the data decimation settings suggests the proposed system is robust for Near Real-Time anomaly detection for underwater gliders.","Anomaly detection,Generative adversarial networks,Marine autonomous systems,Underwater gliders,"
"detecting the red tide algal blooms from satellite ocean color observations in optically complex northeast-asia coastal waters","2006","Over the last few decades, the coastal regions throughout the world have experienced incidences of algal blooms, which are harmful or otherwise toxic because of their potential threat to humans as well as marine organisms, owing to accelerated eutrophication from human activities and certain oceanic processes. Previous studies have found that correct identification of these blooms remains a great challenge with the standard bio-optical algorithms applied to satellite ocean color data in optically complex coastal waters containing high concentrations of the interfered dissolved organic and particulate inorganic materials. Here a new method called the red tide index (RI) is presented which is capable of identifying potential areas of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from SeaWiFS ocean color measurements representing the typical Case-2 water environments off the Korean and Chinese coasts. The RI method employs the water-leaving radiances (Lw), collected from in-situ radiometric measurements of three SeaWiFS bands centered at 443 nm, 510 nm and 555 nm, to achieve derivation of indices that are then related to absorbing characteristics of harmful algae (i.e., Lw at 443 nm) from which a best fit with a cubic polynomial function with correlation coefficient of R2=0.91 is obtained providing indices of higher ranges for HABs and lower and slightly reduced ranges for turbid and non-bloom waters. Similar indices derived from the use of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) and combination of both are found rather inadequate to characterize the variability of the encountered bloom. In order to quantify the HABs in terms of chlorophyll (Chl), an empirical relationship is established between the RI and in-situ Chl in surface waters from about 0.4–71 mg m−3, which yields a Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm (RCA) based on an exponential function with correlation coefficient R2=0.92. The established methods were extensively tested and compared with the performances of standard Ocean Chlorophyll 4 (OC4) algorithm and Local Chlorophyll Algorithm (LCA) using SeaWiFS images collected from typical red tide waters of Korean South Sea (KSS), East China Sea (ECS), Yellow Sea (YS) and Bohai Sea (BS) during 1999–2002. The standard spectral ratio algorithms, the OC4 and LCA, yielded large errors in Chl retrievals for coastal areas, besides providing false information about the encountered HABs in KSS, ECS, YS and BS waters. On the contrary, the RI coupled with the standard spectral ratios yielded comprehensive information about various ranges of algal blooms, while RCA Chl showing a good agreement with in-situ data led to enhanced understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the recent HAB occurrences in high scattering and absorbing waters off the Korean and Chinese coasts.","Red tide Index,Satellite ocean color,OC4 bio-optical algorithm,Korea,HABs,Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm,SeaWiFS,"

"impact of the open biomass fires in spring and summer of 2006 on the chemical composition of background air in south-eastern finland","2008","In the spring and summer of 2006 the air quality in southern Finland was affected by two major biomass fire smoke episodes. At the Virolahti background station, closest to the eastern fire areas, the episodes lasted altogether several weeks. The high point in spring was 25 April and in summer 13 August. In spring the aerosol detected at Virolahti originated at distances of even hundreds of kilometres to the south and south-east, and consequently was a mixture of material from biomass burning and from other sources (both LRT and local), all of which contributed to the detected elevation of PM10 concentrations. The elevated concentrations of trace elements (Cd, Pb, Zn) during the most intense biomass fire episode were associated with other anthropogenic emissions. In contrast, during August 2006, the PM10 at Virolahti was quite exclusively impacted by close (ca. 50–100km) biomass fire sources. The presumably organic component comprised, at its highest, as much as 90% of the total PM10. In addition to record high PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were considerably elevated, even reaching values more typical of wintertime urban environments. During the peaks of the episodes in August, the total gaseous mercury concentration in the air was more than double its background value. In general, the trace elements did not exceed their background values.","PM,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,Total gaseous mercury,Open biomass fires,Trace elements,"

"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"
"fast detection of small targets in high-resolution maritime radars by feature normalization and fusion","2022","Joint exploitation of multiple features is a recognized way to implement the effective detection of small targets on the sea in high-resolution maritime radars at the dwelling mode. The tri-feature-based and feature-compression-based detectors use the time-consuming convex hull learning and decision. In this article, a fast feature-fusion-based detector using seven salient features is proposed, where the convex hull learning and decision are replaced by simple threshold determination and decision. It is found that the seven features of sea clutter can be modeled well by the Burr type XII and t-distributions. From the fitted distribution, each feature is normalized to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution by a nonlinear transformation. In the seven-dimensional normalized feature space, an analytical method is given to calculate the optimal weights of feature fusion by the maximization of the interclass distance of the two-class samples. Owing to the normalization of the seven features, the feature fusion loss is significantly reduced comparing with the direct fusion of seven features. The fast feature-fusion-based detector was evaluated on the open and recognized radar databases and offshore experimental data using an unmanned aerial vehicle with a corner reflector. The results show that the fast detector attains competitive performance with the existing best feature-based detector.","nonlinear transformation,t-distributions,small targets on the sea,statistical distributions,sensor fusion,marine radar,corner reflector,feature fusion loss,radar detection,radar clutter,seven features,small targets,Feature extraction,sea clutter,fast detector attains competitive performance,time-consuming convex hull learning,recognized radar databases,standard Gaussian distribution,unmanned aerial vehicle,offshore experimental data,Fast feature-fusion-based detector,Databases,object detection,feature extraction,high-resolution maritime radars,tri-feature-based detectors,Radar,autonomous aerial vehicles,Burr type XII,simple threshold determination,Training,fast detection,feature normalization,seven salient features,feature-compression-based detectors,Clutter,radar resolution,fast feature-fusion-based detector,Gaussian distribution,seven-dimensional normalized feature space,normalized feature space,Detectors,Radar detection,"

"magnetic detection of archaeological hearths in alaska: a tool for investigating the full span of human presence at the gateway to north america","2019","Magnetic survey methods have recently shown tremendous potential for the detection of archaeological hearths in Eastern Beringia, ranging from intermittent open-air camp fires to larger heat intensive activity areas. Here we present an overview of the method along with eight supporting case studies from seven U.S. National Park Service units in the U.S. state of Alaska, covering diverse geographic settings and time-periods. Together, these case studies demonstrate the capabilities of magnetic detection instruments in various modes of operation for finding datable archaeological deposits that span the breadth of known human occupation of this region. The examples range from the simplest use of the magnetometer as a single sensor reconnaissance instrument in a “search mode”, to use as a gradiometer in conjunction with other geophysical methods such as ground-penetrating radar, to record precise measurements and inform nuanced interpretations. Examples presented here range from the terminal Pleistocene to historic periods, spanning 12,000 years of human activity in Eastern Beringia, and encompassing the arrival, emergence, and expansion of multiple human groups or cultural traditions in the New World.","Arctic,Pleistocene,Denbigh,Bering land bridge,Magnetometer,Hearth,Arctic small tool,Paleoarctic,Northern Archaic,Thule,Ocean Bay,Alaska,Inupiat,Beringia,Birnirk,Norton,"

Down-scaled replicas enable studying large systems in a cost-effective and less laborious manner. The test bench was equipped with instrumentation able to research dynamic effects, loads and vibration acting in a real azimuth thruster. Two servomotors were used in each end of the powertrain. The other acted as the drive motor and the other was used to create excitations and load from the propeller side. Torsional vibration was detected by measuring the twist of the shafts and by utilizing torque transducers. Analysis of the measurement data indicated that the lowest resonance frequencies of the test bench were similar to full-scale thrusters. The revealed dynamic properties suggested by the measurement data enabled the test bench to be concluded as adequate for emulating the torsional dynamics of the full-scale thrusters. The built apparatus will be used for developing digital twins, physical (wired and wireless) and virtual sensors, and techniques for condition monitoring.","servomotors,Torsional vibration,scale test bench,Attitude control,torque control,vibrations,Virtual sensor,Mechanical power transmission,aerospace propulsion,digital twin research,maritime thruster,Thruster,measurement data,vibration,digital twins,Vibrations,full-scale thrusters,power transmission (mechanical),down-scaled replicas,maritime azimuth thruster,Resonant frequency,torsion,Soft sensors,Test bench,Digital twin,shafts,condition monitoring,small-scale powertrain test bench,Azimuth,Loss measurement,Small-scale powertrain,"
"butyltin residues in blue mussels (mytilus edulis) and arkshells (scapharca broughtonii) collected from korean coastal waters","2002","Butyltin compounds (BTs) including tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, di- (DBT) and mono-butyltin (MBT), were determined in bivalves such as blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and arkshells (Scapharca broughtonii) collected from Korean coastal waters. BTs were detected in all the blue mussels and arkshells analyzed. The concentrations of total butyltin (ΣBTs: MBT+DBT+TBT) in blue mussels and arkshells ranged from 49 to 2500 ng/g and 29 to 87 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Higher concentrations of BTs were found in blue mussels collected from Okpo and Kohyonsong Bays and Jangsengpo Harbor where large shipyards and harbors are located with dry-dock facilities. This suggested that maritime activities nearby the harbors play a major role as the source of BTs. Concentrations of TBT in mussels collected from Korea were one of the highest values reported, suggesting ongoing TBT contamination in Korea. Among BTs, TBT was the predominant compound both in blue mussels and arkshells collected from almost all the sampling locations, indicating the fresh input of TBT in Korean coastal waters. Smaller mussels tended to accumulate BTs at higher concentrations than larger ones, which may be due to higher filtration rate of small mussels and/or contact with surface microlayer in intertidal zones.","Blue mussel (),Butyltin compounds,Korean coastal waters,Antifouling paint,TBT,"

"a novel network security algorithm based on improved support vector machine from smart city perspective","2018","Computer generated security concerns have become more modern and complex. Intrusion detection(ID) is a practical issue in the field of computer security whose primary objective is to detect rare attack or assaults and to ensure the security of interior systems. This paper also proposes a semi-class intrusion detection method that combines multiple classifiers to arrange exceptions and typical exercises in a computer system. The abuse detection model is constructed in the light of the decision tree learning-iterative dichotomise 3(DTL-ID3) and is assembled by utilizing the gathered data based on anomaly detection model executed by one class-support vector machine(OC-SVM). In recent years, people have paid more attention to ID/intrusion prevention system (IDS / IPS), which is closely related to the protection and utilization of system management. A few machine-learning standards including neural system, direct hereditary programming, and advanced support vector machines(ASVMs), Bayesian system, multivariate versatile relapse splines, fluffy derivation systems(FIS) and other analogical systems have been researched for the outline of intrusion detection system. In this paper, we build up an amalgam method based on DTL-ID3 and OC-SVM(A-DT and SVM) and evaluate the performance of the projected methodology by using a specific dataset and a crossover method in order to enhance the accuracy of IDS/IPS when contrasted with a singular support vector machine.","Intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system,Data mining,One class-support vector machine,Decision tree learning-iterative dichotomise 3,"

"a big data analytics method for the evaluation of ship - ship collision risk reflecting hydrometeorological conditions","2021","This paper presents a big data analytics method for the evaluation of ship-ship collision risk in real operational conditions. The approach makes use of big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) and nowcast data corresponding to time-dependent traffic situations and hydro-meteorological conditions respectively. An Avoidance Behavior-based Collision Detection Model (ABCD-M) is introduced to identify potential collision scenarios and Collision Risk Indices (CRIs) are quantified when evasive actions are taken for each detected collision scenario in various voyages. The method is applied on Ro-Pax ships operating over 13 months of the ice-free period in the Gulf of Finland. Results indicate that collision risk estimates may be extremely diverse among voyages, and in 97.5% of potential collision scenarios the evasive actions are triggered only when risk is at 45% or more of its maximum value. The overall CRI for ships operating over the given area tends to be lower for adverse hydro-meteorological conditions. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may assist with the (1) identification of critical scenarios in various voyages not currently accounted for by existing accident databases, (2) definition of commonly agreed risk criteria to set off alarms, (3) the estimation of risk profile over the life cycle of fleet operations.","Gulf of Finland,Maritime operations,Ship safety,Machine learning,Collisions,Big data analytics,"

"vision based boat detection for maritime surveillance","2016","Automatic boat detection plays an important role for maritime surveillance. However, maritime environment represents lots of challenges such as wave of water, boat movements, and weather condition. This paper presents a method for detecting moving boats from sequence of images. We reply on background subtraction (BS) techniques to detect main movements in the scene. However, as the BS algorithms detect only motion pixels, they cannot detect when boats stay immobile for a moment or move slightly. In addition, the BS results often suffer strongly from water waves as well as boat wake. To overcome these drawbacks we detect salient regions using saliency detection techniques (SD) on images. We then apply dynamic fusion technique on BS and SD results for a final boat detection. Experiments have been conducted on a very challenging dataset and show promising results (detection rate achieved to 89%).","vision based boat detection,dynamic fusion technique,motion pixel,background subtration,water wave,automatic boat detection,Feature extraction,BS algorithm,image fusion,boats,maritime surveillance,boat movement,object detection,background subtraction technique,salient region,saliency detection,image sequence,boat detection,saliency detection technique,Indexes,weather condition,image sequences,Boats,Visualization,Surveillance,video surveillance,boat wake,Dynamics,"

"adaptive mission planning for cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles","2013","This paper addresses the problem of developing an autonomous cooperative multi-vehicle system composed of one simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) guided by a more capable, sensor-equipped, surface or underwater vehicle. Specifically, in this work we consider a system composed of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) able to localize a small-sized UUV via a multibeam sonar and, then, to guide it via an acoustic link to reach a target. The UUV is equipped with low-cost navigation sensors (a compass and a depth sensor), and to estimate its own position relies on the data received by the ASV (range and bearing from the ASV and ASV position). This paradigm was applied in the domain of mine countermeasures (MCM) to realize the NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System. In this system the low-cost feature of the UUV is of the most importance since the UUV is supposed to be expendable. In this approach, however, there may be cases in which the underwater vehicle cannot be detected by the sonar for extended time periods causing drifts in the UUV position estimate, potentially compromising the mission. This paper presents a set of behaviors to address this situation. The behaviors coordinate ASV circular search patterns together with sending to the UUV purposely generated navigation updates. The aim is to limit the distance between the two vehicles, increasing the probability of sonar reacquisition, and at the same time ensuring that the UUV progresses toward the target. Results from sea trials held in Elba island (Italy) during ANT12 experiments (in June 2012) are reported, and demonstrate the approach is effective and can push our system toward full autonomy.","autonomous cooperative multivehicle system,mine countermeasures domain,low-cost navigation sensors,ANT12 experiments,multi-robot systems,control engineering computing,small-sized UUV,NATO CMRE Autonomous Mine Neutralization System,ASV position bearing,Elba island,Italy,Sonar navigation,navigation updates,Vehicles,sonar reacquisition probability,autonomous surface vehicle,Three-dimensional displays,software architecture,adaptive mission planning,autonomous underwater vehicles,simple low-cost unmanned underwater vehicle,time periods,ASV circular search patterns,compass,Sonar,vehicle distance,sensors,sonar,multibeam sonar,Acoustics,depth sensor,path planning,cooperative autonomous maritime vehicles,ASV,mobile robots,MCM domain,Sensors,ASV position range,acoustic link,sensor position estimation,"

"perturbation analysis for maritime applications","2012","Target detection of marine features is a major topic for the security and monitoring of coastlines. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be particularly useful because of its all-weather and night capability.

The latter can be applied for detection of ships (non-marine targets) or classification of sea ice. The algorithm can be considered to be a negative filter focused on sea. Consequently, all the features which have a polarimetric behaviour different from the sea are detected and considered as targets. A complete validation with RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric data was performed in Portsmouth, UK. An accurate ground truth carried out during the acquisition, was accompanied, considering AIS GPS location and photographic evidences.

"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","Underwater glider,Variational autoencoder,Marine autonomous system,Anomaly detection,Long short-term memory network,"
"deep learning aided beam vector assignment for massive mimo maritime communication considering location information and handover impact","2022","Location aided beamforming (LAB) has been proposed as a potential solution to fast beam vector (BV) selection for massive multi-input multi-output (M-MIMO) maritime communication systems. However, the existing LAB schemes hardly consider the impact from handover. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD) to improve the system performance, particularly in the handover zone, by exploiting the information of sea lane and locations of the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, inspired by the rationale of deep learning (DL) aided image processing methods, we first transform the BV assignment problem to a location-based artificial gray value classification problem, and then utilize a convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) to predict the BV indices from a predefined codebook constituted by location-related feature matrices. In addition, we exploit GAD to rectify the training data of CDBN, such that the prediction on BV assignments can be more accurate to achieve a higher capacity than known methods. Finally, an extensive comparison with selected existing schemes through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Convolutional deep belief network (CDBN),Maritime communication,Deep learning (DL),Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO),Gaussian anomaly detection (GAD),"
"monotonic trends in spatio-temporal distribution and concentration of monsoon precipitation (1901–2002), west bengal, india","2016","This paper intended to investigate spatio-temporal monotonic trend and shift in concentration of monsoon precipitation across West Bengal, India, by analysing the time series of monthly precipitation from 18 weather stations during the period from 1901 to 2002. In dealing with, the inhomogeneity in the precipitation series, RHtestsV4 software package is used to detect, and adjust for, multiple change points (shifts) that could exist in data series. Finally, the cumulative deviation test was applied at 5% significant level to check the homogeneity (presence of historic changes by cumulative deviations test). Afterward, non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Theil-Sen estimator (TSE) was applied to detect of nature and slope of trends; and, Sequential Mann Kendall (SQMK) test was applied for detection of turning point and magnitude of change in trends. Prior to the application of statistical tests, the pre-whitening technique was used to eliminate the effect of autocorrelation in precipitation data series. Four indices- precipitation concentration index (PCI), precipitation concentration degree (PCD), precipitation concentration period (PCP) and fulcrum (centre of gravity) were used to detect precipitation concentration and the spatial pattern in it. The application of the above-mentioned procedures has shown very notable statewide monotonic trend for monsoon precipitation time series. Regional cluster analysis by SQMK found increasing precipitation in mountain and coastal regions in general, except during the non- monsoon seasons. The results show that higher PCI values were mainly observed in South Bengal, whereas lower PCI values were mostly detected in North Bengal. The PCI values are noticeably larger in places where both monsoon total precipitation and span of rainy season are lower. The results of PCP reveal that precipitation in Gangetic Bengal mostly occurs in summer (monsoon season), and the rainy season arrives earlier in North Bengal than South Bengal, whereas the results of PCD also indicate that the precipitation in North Bengal was more dispersed within a year than that in South Bengal. The concentration characteristic of precipitation could be detected by fulcrum analysis, and significant concentration over most of West Bengal was obvious within July month band. Precipitation trend observed in West Bengal is compared with that in Central India (CI) region and comparison of precipitation departure with Indian monsoon and Gangetic Bengal can be explained by forecasting ensemble.","Monotonic trend,Central India (CI),Shift in concentration,Precipitation concentration degree (PCD),Precipitation concentration period (PCP),Precipitation concentration index (PCI),Fulcrum (centre of gravity),Monsoon precipitation,"
"a novelty detection approach to diagnosing hull and propeller fouling","2019","Hull and propeller performance have a primary role in overall vessel efficiency. Vessel fouling is a common phenomenon where undesirable substances attach or grow on the ship hull.

In this paper, the authors investigate the problems of predicting the hull condition in real operations based on data measured by the on-board systems. The proposed solution uses an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) modelling technique to eliminate the need for collecting labeled data related to the hull and propeller fouling condition. Two anomaly detection methods based on Support Vector Machines and k-nearest neighbour have been applied to predict the hull condition using the available parameters measured on-board.

"unmanned aerial vehicle landing on maritime vessels using signal prediction of the ship motion","2018","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more prevalent in maritime operations. For safe operation, one of the key challenges of using UAVs at sea is the relative motion that exists between the UAV and ship. For perpetual maritime operations, UAV systems need to be able to land safely on ocean vessels. Determining a `quiescent period', where the roll and pitch angles of the ship are below a danger threshold, is a challenging problem for UAV systems. In general, current strategies rely on reactive systems and often use sensors on board the maritime vessel. The scope of the current paper is a proof-of-concept methodology which uses a signal prediction algorithm to facilitate safer autonomous UAV-ship landings. This study uses laser ranging and detecting devices (LIDAR) in conjunction with a signal prediction algorithm (SPA) to forecast when the ship motion is within safe landing limits. ShipMo3D was used to generate twelve trial cases for UAV-ship landings on a 33 m ship. The results show that with the use of the SPA, the number of UAV landing attempts was decreased by an average of 2 attempts, per test case, when compared to a system that did not use an SPA. Moreover, the results indicate that with revised tuning of the SPA, the likelihood of a safe landing can be further improved.","maritime vessel,ShipMo3D,Prediction algorithms,Marine vehicles,Mathematical model,laser ranging,ship motion,Laser radar,laser ranging and detecting devices,unmanned aerial vehicle landing,ships,aircraft landing guidance,optical radar,autonomous UAV-ship landings,autonomous aerial vehicles,Tracking,ocean vessels,Unmanned aerial vehicles,LIDAR,perpetual maritime operations,signal prediction algorithm,SPA,Brushless motors,"

"leaf phenology paradox: why warming matters most where it is already warm","2018","Interactions between climate and ecosystem properties that control phenological responses to climate warming and drought are poorly understood. To determine contributions from these interactions, we used space-borne remotely sensed vegetation indices to monitor leaf development across climate gradients and ecoregions in the southeastern United States. We quantified how air temperature, drought severity, and canopy thermal stress contribute to changes in leaf flushing from mountainous to coastal plain regions by developing a hierarchical state-space Bayesian model. We synthesized daily field climate data with daily vegetation indices and canopy surface temperature during spring green-up season at 59 sites in the southeastern United States between 2001 and 2012. Our results demonstrated strong interaction effects between ecosystem properties and climate variables across ecoregions. We found spring green-up is faster in the mountains, while coastal forests express a larger sensitivity to inter-annual temperature anomalies. Despite our detection of a decreasing trend in sensitivity to warming with temperature in all regions, we identified an ecosystem interaction: Deciduous dominated forests are less sensitive to warming than are those with fewer deciduous trees, likely due to the continuous presence of leaves in evergreen species throughout the season. Mountainous forest green-up is more susceptible to intensifying drought and moisture deficit, while coastal areas are relatively resilient. We found that with increasing canopy thermal stress, defined as canopy-air temperature difference, leaf development slows following dry years, and accelerates following wet years.","Multispectral,NDVI,Southeastern US,Warming,Spring,EVI,Land surface temperature,Forest,Phenology,Green-up,Hierarchical modeling,Daily Vegetation Index,Bayesian,MODIS,Climate change,"
"gold nanoparticle assisted colorimetric biosensors for rapid polyethylene terephthalate (pet) sensing for sustainable environment to monitor microplastics","2023","The extremely widespread and ubiquitous nature of plastics, estimated to boost its global production by 26 billion tons till 2050. The large chunks of plastic waste that decomposed down to micro- or nano plastics (MNPs) leads to various ill effects on biological entities. The conventional PET detection methods lack rapid detection of microplastics due to variances in microplastic features, long-drawn-out sample pre-processing procedures and complex instrumentation. Therefore, an instantaneous colorimetric evaluation of microplastic will ensures the simplicity of conducting assays on field. Several nanoparticle-based biosensors that detects proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites operate on either cluster or disperse state of nanoparticle. However, gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) emerges an ideal scaffold for sensory element in lateral flow biosensors due to their simple surface functionalization, unique optoelectronic properties and varied colour spectrum depending on morphologies and aggregation state. In this paper an effort has been made in the form of a hypothesis using in silico tools as a basis to detect polyethylene terephthalate (PET) – most abundant type of microplastic using gold nanoparticle based lateral flow biosensor. We retrieved sequences of PET-binding synthetic peptides and modelled their 3-D structure using I-Tasser server. The best protein model for each peptide sequences are docked with PET monomers – BHET, MHET and other PET polymeric ligands, to evaluate their binding affinities. The synthetic peptide SP 1 (WPAWKTHPILRM) docked with BHET and (MHET)4 exhibits 1.5-fold increases in binding affinity as compared to reference PET anchor peptide Dermaseptin SI (DSI). The GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation studies of synthetic peptide SP 1 - BHET & - (MHET)4 complexes for 50 ns further confirmed the stable binding.

The results of 87 long-term time series analysed (~512,000 observations), in the last four decades, indicate four groups of climate regime shifts: 1) A gradual shift associated with CC starting in the 1980s, with a warming of the sea surface down to 100 m depth in the bay (0.10-0.25 °C per decade), increase in air temperature and insolation. This warming may have impacted on benthic community redistribution in the Basque coast, favouring warm-water species relative to cold-water species. Weight at age for anchovy and sardine decreased in the last two decades. 2) Deepening of the winter mixed layer depth in the south-eastern bay that probably led to increases in nutrients, surface oxygen, and chlorophyll concentration. Current increases on chlorophyll and zooplankton (i.e., copepods) biomass are contrary to those expected under CC scenarios in the region. 3) Sea-level rise (1.5-3.5 cm per decade since 1990s), associated with CC. 4) Increase of extreme wave height events of 16.8 cm per decade in the south-eastern bay, probably related to stormy conditions in the last decade, with impacts on beach erosion. Estimating accurate rates of sea warming, sea-level rise, extreme events, and foreseeing the future pathways of marine productivity, are key to define the best adaptation measures to minimize negative CC impacts in the region.","GAMM,Marine biodiversity,Benthos,Anchovy,Geomorphology,Sea warming,Extreme events,Basque coast,Climate change,"
"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking. The DeepSORVF code and FVessel dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/gy65896/DeepSORVF and https://github.com/gy65896/FVessel, respectively.","Trajectory,deep neural network,anti-occlusion tracking,Visualization,Radar tracking,Object detection,vessel traffic surveillance,Artificial intelligence,Inland waterways,Surveillance,Data integration,data fusion,"
"ais-based evaluation of target detectors and sar sensors characteristics for maritime surveillance","2015","This paper studies the performances of different ship detectors based on adaptive threshold algorithms. The detection algorithms are based on various clutter distributions and assessed automatically with a systematic methodology. Evaluation using large datasets of medium resolution SAR images and AIS (automatic identification system) data as ground truths allows to evaluate the efficiency of each detector. Depending on the datasets used for testing, the detection algorithms offer different advantages and disadvantages. The systematic method used in discriminating real detected targets and false alarms in order to determine the detection rate, allows us to perform an appropriate and consistent comparison of the detectors. The impact of SAR sensors characteristics (incidence angle, polarization, frequency and spatial resolution) is fully assessed, the vessels' length being also considered.

"chemical munitions search & assessment—an evaluation of the dumped munitions problem in the baltic sea","2016","Chemical Munitions Search & Assessment (CHEMSEA) project has performed studies on chemical weapon (CW) detection, sediment pollution and spreading as well as biological effects of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) dumped in the Baltic Sea. Results suggest that munitions containing CWAs are more scattered on the seafloor than suspected, and previously undocumented dumpsite was discovered in Gdansk Deep. Pollution of sediments with CWA degradation products was local and close to the detected objects; however the pollution range was larger than predicted with theoretical models. Bottom currents observed in the dumpsites were strong enough for sediment re-suspension, and contributed to the transport of polluted sediments. Diversity and density of the faunal communities were poor at the dumping sites in comparison to the reference area, although the direct effects of CWA on benthos organisms were difficult to determine due to hypoxic or even anoxic conditions near the bottom. Equally, the low oxygen might have affected the biological effects assessed in cod and caged blue mussels. Nonetheless, both species showed significantly elevated molecular and cellular level responses at contaminated sites compared to reference sites.","Chemical warfare agents,Chemical weapons,Baltic Sea,Biomarkers,Near bottom currents,"
"enabling security functions with sdn: a feasibility study","2015","Software-defined networking (SDN) is being strongly considered as the next promising networking platform, and studies regarding SDN have been actively conducted accordingly. However, the security of SDN remains undefined and unknown when considering the enhancement of network security in SDN. In this paper, we verify whether SDN can enhance network security. Specifically, the idea of enabling security functions with diverse SDN features is explored thoroughly. In order to elucidate the feasibility of SDN-based security functions, we implement four types of security functions with SDN in Floodlight applications: (i) in-line mode security functions (e.g. firewalls and IPS), (ii) passive mode security functions (e.g. IDS), (iii) network anomaly detection functions (e.g. scan and DDoS detector), and (iv) advanced security functions (e.g. stateful firewall and reflector networks). Furthermore, we focus on discovering issues that might arise throughout the implementation of SDN-based security applications and discuss how these issues can be addressed. In order to appropriately prove the feasibility of the SDN-based security applications, we evaluate our Floodlight applications in real testbeds that consist of SDN-enabled switches and a number of physical hosts.","Software-defined networking security,Network security,SDN security,"

Due to the restrained power budget from BeiDou satellites, a long integration time is indispensable. And the use of multiple satellite transmitters enhances the target detection performance. In this paper, first, the keystone transform (KT) is applied on each individual echo to correct range cell migration (RCM). Then, a long-time integration method based on dechirp processing and Fourier transform is utilized, concentrating each echo into Doppler centroid (DC) and Doppler frequency rate (DFR) domain. Finally, to integrate the echoes from multiple satellite transmitters, spherical intersection (SX) method is used to localize the target, followed with the compensation of DC shifts. The effectiveness of the maritime moving target detection technique is shown by simulations.","moving target detection,Fourier transforms,opportunistic transmitters,range cell migration,marine radar,Doppler frequency rate domain,power budget,radar detection,satellite transmitters,passive radar,RCM,Fourier transform,SX method,passive multistatic radar,BeiDou satellites,keystone transform,spherical intersection method,satellite navigation,Passive multistatic radar,maritime surveillance,object detection,DFR domain,BeiDou-based radar,DC shifts,long-time integration method,dechirp processing,maritime moving target detection,space-time integration,Doppler radar,spaceborne radar,radio transmitters,radar cross-sections,"
"insights and guidance for offshore co2 storage monitoring based on the qics, eti mmv, and stemm-ccs projects","2020","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","CCS,Location,Offshore CO2 storage,Regulation,Impact assessment,Quantification,Monitoring,Verification,Detection,Attribution,"

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"
"long-run forecasting surface and groundwater dynamics from intermittent observation data: an evaluation for 50 years","2023","The accurate prediction of water dynamics is critical for operational water resource management. In this study, we propose a novel approach to perform long-term forecasts of daily water dynamics, including river levels, river discharges, and groundwater levels, with a lead time of 7–30 days. The approach is based on the state-of-the-art neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), to enhance the accuracy and consistency of dynamic predictions. The operation of this forecasting system relies on an in-situ database observed for over 50 years with records gauging in 19 rivers, the karst aquifer, the English Channel, and the meteorological network in Normandy, France. To address the problem of missing measurements and gauge installations over time, we developed an adaptive scheme in which the neural network is regularly adjusted and re-trained in response to changing inputs during a long operation. Advances in BiLSTM with extensive learning past-to-future and future-to-past further help to avoid time-lag calibration that simplifies data processing. The proposed approach provides high accuracy and consistent prediction for the three water dynamics within a similar accuracy range as an on-site observation, with approximately 3 % error in the measurement range for the 7 day-ahead predictions and 6 % error for the 30 d-ahead predictions. The system also effectively fills the gap in actual measurements and detects anomalies at gauges that can last for years. Working with multiple dynamics not only proves that the data-driven model is a unified approach but also reveals the impact of the physical background of the dynamics on the performance of their predictions. Groundwater undergoes a slow filtration process following a low-frequency fluctuation, favoring long-term prediction, which differs from other higher-frequency river dynamics. The physical nature drives the predictive performance even when using a data-driven model.","Water dynamics forecast,Deep learning,Bidirectional long short-term memory,Groundwater level,River recharge,River level,"

Near marinas 50% of the exposed species were sterile after six weeks. In general, no dissolved butyltins were detected in the Rhine and Scheldt estuaries. In 1988 TBT concentrations in marinas ranged from 120 to 4000 ng litre−1. In sediments (fraction <60 μm) and suspended particulate matter TBT concentrations reached up to 1200 ng g−1. TBT concentrations in mussel tissue ranged from <1 to 2300 ng g−1 based on a dry weight. In 1989 concentrations of dissolved TBT ranged from <0·1 to 7200 ng litre−1. In 1989 a seasonal study in the marina of Colijnsplaat showed that dissolved butyltins increased from April to the end of May due to the launching of freshly painted boats, and decreased afterwards.",""
"potential hot spots contaminated with exogenous, rare earth elements originating from e-waste dismantling and recycling","2022","Dismantling and recycling e-waste has been recognized as a potential emission source of rare earth elements (REEs). However, the presence of REEs in typical regional soils has yet to be studied. Given the potential health implications of such soil contamination, it is vital to study the characteristics, spatial distribution, and pollution level of REEs caused by e-waste dismantling as well as determine the influencing mechanism. This study focused on Guiyu Town as an example site, which is a typical e-waste dismantling base. From the site, 39 topsoil samples of different types were collected according to grid distribution points. Soil profiles were also collected in the dismantling and non-dismantling areas. The REE characteristic parameters showed that the REE distribution was abnormal and was affected by multiple factors. The results of the integrated pollution index showed that approximately 61.5% of soil samples were considered to be lightly polluted. Spatial distribution and correlation analysis showed that hot spots of REE-polluted soil coincided with known, main pollution sources. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation (p ≤0.05) between the REE concentration and the distance from the pollution source. E-waste disassembly and recycling greatly affect the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding soil as well as downward migration areas. In the disassembly area, REE accumulated more easily in the surface layer (0–20 cm). Geographical detector results showed that distance factor was the main contribution factor for both light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth element (HREE) (q = 34.59% and 53.33%, respectively). REE distribution in soil was nonlinear enhanced by different factors. Taken together, these results showed that e-waste disassembling and recycling not only directly affected the spatial distribution of REEs, but that their distribution was also affected by land use type and soil properties.","Influencing mechanism,Hot spot,E-waste,Anthropogenic REE,Factor contribution,"
"maritime traffic speed enforcement","2012","This paper describes a speed warning system for boats moving on a wide water surface using a single grayscale camera. Boats are detected, their speed estimated, and statistics are also computed.

The method returns correct speed values within the range 65% in the 97% of use cases. This system has been in operation for 3 years on the Burano island in Venice, monitoring a 250 m wide channel slice. The estimated speed is shown to the boats thanks to a digital display.

Most research in this field has been directed towards the investigation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction and classification tasks, with the result that even small CNNs with up to four layers outperform conventional methods.

On one hand, due to the quick development of deep learning it serves as an introduction for researchers, either just starting their work in this specific field or working on classical methods for the past years, and helps them to learn about the recent achievements. On the other hand, our main goal is to guide further research in this field by identifying main research gaps to bridge.

"meteotsunamis at the río de la plata estuary","2022","A recent numerical study showed that low-amplitude meteotsunamis could be detected at the Río de la Plata (RDP) estuary. In this work, eight sea level series (one year long, 2018) were analyzed: six measured within the RDP estuary and two at the adjacent continental shelf. All meteotsunami events during 2018 were identified and analyzed at the RDP estuary, and the maximum wave height observed was 0.78 m. The atmospheric conditions during the analyzed events were investigated, showing that the presence of atmospheric cold fronts and atmospheric gravity waves seem to happen simultaneously with meteotsunami events. From sea-level observations gathered at the estuary it was inferred that the meteotsunamis could be driven by atmospheric forcings propagating (i) mainly from SE to NW (the meteotsunami would be driven along the estuary from the outer to the upper RDP, and the Proudman resonance mechanism could explain its amplification), (ii) predominantly from SW to NE (the meteotsunami would be simultaneously generated at different locations of the RDP estuary), or (iii) the meteotsunami could be generated in waters of the continental shelf, to get into the RDP estuary, and then freely propagates from the outer to the upper RDP (in this case the Proudman resonance mechanism would not explain the amplification within the estuary). It is important to mention that the results of the present investigation are biased to the high-period band of meteotsunamis because the sampling interval (20 min, for most locations) is rather large to allow the study of the whole meteotsunami frequency band.","Río de la Plata (RPD) estuary,Proudman resonance,Meteorological tsunami,Atmospheric cold fronts,Atmospheric gravity waves,"
"interception of chemicals at a forest edge for a rural low-lying site at black wood, hampshire, southern england","1994","Precipitation (rainfall and snowfall), throughfall, stemflow and net-precipitation (throughfall and stemflow) chemistry data are presented for a block-network of collectors located in a beech plantation in a rural area of southern England. The precipitation shows a variable chemistry linked to the relative supplies of material derived from maritime, pollutant and lithogenic sources. Inputs of solutes are spatially variable for those components associated with pollutant sources indicating local and variable sources for these constituents. Gaseous concentrations of SOx, NOx and NH3 all average ∼ 8 ppb outside the forest: within the forest, lower concentrations were observed. The precipitation — throughfall — stemflow results indicate that the trees capture occult deposition (i.e. non-precipitation detected atmospheric supplies of materials, e.g. from fine-droplets/mist, gases and particulate matter), thereby enriching the composition of stemflow and throughfall. Concentrations and fluxes of most solutes are increased by between 50 and 100%: only strontium, barium and hydrogen ions show a depletion. At the forest edge, there is an even greater difference between the precipitation and net-precipitation, especially for the sea-salts: the trees at the forest edge are particularly efficient at scavenging the occult materials. There are differences in chemical fluxes for the blocks that are not simply confined to an edge-interior division: this is most marked for manganese where cycling through the vegetation is dominant and the various locations respond in different ways. Despite storm damage there is little sign of a change in the chemical fluxes to the catchment: the loss of canopy is probably compensated for by an increased roughness that, in turn, results in increased turbulence, higher interception loss and greater scavenging.","Rainfall,Throughfall,Forest,Beech,Chemical,Interception,Stemflow,"
"a new detection method for ldos attacks based on data mining","2022","The serving capabilities of networks are reduced by low-rate denial of service (LDoS) attacks that periodically send high-intensity pulse data flows. This type of attack shows a harmful effect similar to that of traditional DoS attacks, but their attack modes differ greatly.

The problem of too many false tracks as a result of background noise is solved by using Hough transform and logic-based algorithm optimized under the relevant constraints. In addition, an optimization method of Kalman filtering is proposed based on the predicted value of the stable course of maritime targets to solve track jitter.

"north atlantic forcing of millennial-scale indo-australian monsoon dynamics during the last glacial period","2013","Recent studies of the Last Glacial period Indo-Australian summer monsoon (IASM) have revealed links to both northern and southern hemisphere high latitude climate as well as to regional ocean conditions. Particular interest has been paid to the monsoon response to Heinrich events, with variability explained by meridional shifts in positioning of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), but this model has not been adequately tested. In addition, the shorter-lived Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) events have not been detected (beyond D/O-1, the Bølling/Allerød) in land-based records from the Indo-Pacific, despite their prominent expression in stalagmites from southern Asia, raising questions about the sensitivity of the IASM to these events. Here we present a Southern Hemisphere stalagmite oxygen isotopic time series from Ball Gown Cave (BGC), tropical northern Australia, located on the margins of the modern austral summer ITCZ, that spans 40–31 and 27–8 ka. Elevated IASM rainfall coincides with Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas, while decreased rainfall characterizes D/O interstadials, a response that is anti-phased with sites spanning the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and with Chinese records of the East Asian summer monsoon. The BGC time series thus reveals a precipitation dipole consistent with a southward (northward) migration of the ITCZ during periods of high northern latitude cooling (warming) as the primary driver of millennial-scale IASM variability during the Last Glacial period. Our record indicates a strengthening of the IASM after the Younger Dryas period, likely as a result of rising sea level and sea surface temperatures, breaking the link with the high latitudes.","Last Glacial Maximum,Oxygen isotope,Indo-Australian summer monsoon,Kimberley,Stalagmite,"
"radar-based maritime collision avoidance using dynamic window","2018","Collision avoidance systems are a key ingredient in developing autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Such systems require real-time information about the environment, which can be obtained from transponder-based systems or exteroceptive sensors located on the ASV.

The system was validated in full-scale experiments in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, in May 2017. The probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) is used for tracking target vessels. The output from the PDAF is processed through a least-squares retrodiction procedure in order to provide the COLAV system with sufficiently accurate course estimates. A tracking interface provides estimates of target states to the COLAV system, which is based on the dynamic window (DW) algorithm. DW is a reactive COLAV algorithm originally designed for ground vehicles, and we therefore make a number of modifications to adapt it for use with high-speed ASVs.

"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"acoustic emission characteristics of a single cylinder diesel generator at various loads and with a failing injector","2017","Acoustic emission sensing techniques have been applied in recent years to dynamic machinery with varying degrees of success in diagnosing various component faults and distinguishing between operating conditions. This work explores basic properties of acoustic emission signals measured on a small single cylinder diesel engine in a laboratory setting. As reported in other works in the open literature, the measured acoustic emission on the engine is mostly continuous mode and individual burst events are generally not readily identifiable. Therefore, the AE are processed into the local (instantaneous) root mean square (rms) value of the signal which is averaged over many cycles to obtain a mean rms AE in the crank angle domain. Crank-resolved spectral representation of the AE is also given but rigorous investigation of the AE spectral qualities is left to future study. Cycle-to-cycle statistical dispersion of the AE signal is considered to highlight highly variable engine processes. Engine speed was held constant but load conditions are varied to investigate AE signal sensitivity to operating condition. Furthermore, during the course of testing the fuel injector developed a fault and acoustic emission signals were captured and several signal attributes were successful in distinguishing this altered condition.

"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper. In order to complete the online real-time detection of ship abnormal behavior with multivariate and multidimensional time series, improve the accuracy of ship abnormal behavior detection and reduce the blind area of VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) system monitoring.","ship abnormal behavior monitoring,VTS system,sea environment set,graph attention network,multivariate time series,graph neural network,Marine vehicles,neural nets,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,VTS system monitoring,multidimensional time series,sliding window,Data models,object detection,vessel traffic service,Time series analysis,existing maritime intelligent supervision,online real-time detection,Real-time systems,graph theory,time series,ship abnormal behavior detection method,Trajectory,maritime supervision,fixed data input generation,Cognition,traffic engineering computing,ship abnormal behavior detection,abnormal behavior characteristics,ship behavior characteristics,"
"green rf/fso communications in cognitive relay-based space information networks for maritime surveillance","2019","In this paper, we provide an overview of a space-based network for the maritime surveillance information sharing and evaluate the coverage, the throughput and the real-time reception capacity of the presented systems. The focus is on the feeder link of a multi-hop geostationary satellite system. We propose a cognitive relay-based architecture for the inter-satellite and satellite-to-ground communication with a multi-band spectrum sensing operating on both free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) bands. Furthermore, modeling the spectrum sensing energy as a Gamma distribution we derive the formula of the network energy consumption in presence of multipath fading and considering two different data relay schemes: amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). We prove that the RF/FSO communication in the proposed relay-based architecture enhances the data transmission increasing the throughput and the real-time reception capacity and reducing the network energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the DF scheme overcomes the AF one in terms of energy consumption while the AF scheme overcomes the DF one in terms of probability detection, both experience the same throughput. Finally, the proposed novel architecture has been compared with existing ones showing that it enhances the current maritime surveillance systems by jointly optimizing communication functionalities.","inter-satellite communication,surveillance,telecommunication power management,cognitive radio,real-time reception capacity,multi-hop networks,satellite systems,Marine vehicles,radio frequency free-space optical communications,cognitive relay-based networks,radio spectrum management,green RF/FSO communications,free-space optical communication,Satellite communication,detection probability,network energy consumption,marine engineering,optimisation,coverage evaluation,amplify-and-forward,multiband spectrum sensing,feeder link,decode-and-forward,maritime surveillance information sharing,space information networks,multihop geostationary satellite system,Spread spectrum communication,relay networks (telecommunication),decode and forward communication,data relay,satellite links,Maritime surveillance,signal detection,satellite-to-ground communication,Surveillance,throughput,RF/FSO communication,multipath fading,network energy,amplify and forward communication,oceanographic techniques,"
"coarse-to-fine luminance estimation for low-light image enhancement in maritime video surveillance","2019","Captured images in maritime video surveillance under non-uniform illumination conditions easily suffer from low contrast and details loss. The low-quality images may significantly result in negative effects in practical applications, e.g., target detection, recognition, classification and tracking, etc. Increasing attention has recently been paid to improve the quality of low-light images via computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose to establish a two-step luminance estimation framework to enhance low-light images. In particular, the coarse luminance is firstly estimated using traditional Max-RGB which extracts the highest pixel values in each color channel. The refined luminance is obtained by introducing a weighted variational model which has the capacities of structure-preserving and texture-smoothing. Based on the estimated well-constructed luminance, the enhanced low-light images are obtained by combining Retinex model with its extended version. The image quality is further improved through a BM3D-based denoising approach. Experimental results on both synthetic and realistic low-light images have demonstrated the satisfactory imaging performance in termsP of quantitative and qualitative evaluations.","Image enhancement,image denoising,Image restoration,Lighting,BM3D-based denoising approach,image enhancement,weighted variational model,Image color analysis,low-quality images,max-RGB,image colour analysis,Atmospheric modeling,retinex model,marine engineering,brightness,computer vision,object detection,image texture,synthetic low-light images,image reconstruction,color channel,image quality,realistic low-light images,low-light image enhancement,two-step luminance estimation framework,details loss,video surveillance,coarse-to-fine luminance estimation,Estimation,Channel estimation,maritime video surveillance,"
"improving maritime anomaly detection and situation awareness through interactive visualization","2008","Surveillance of large land, air or sea areas with a multitude of sensor and sensor types typically generates huge amounts of data. Human operators trying to establish individual or collective maritime situation awareness are often overloaded by this information.

"maritime containers tracking trial results","2009","There are approximately 7 million maritime-style containers within Canada, and 70 million within the US. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. With market globalization, a large amount of these containers enter North America on a daily basis. Such containers may include contraband or dangerous items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements, only 3 to 5 % of the maritime containers, that arrive in, or transition through, North America, go through physical inspection. Current container tracking technologies based on GPS consume high DC power, are costly, require line-of-sight with satellites, and are often too large to be covert. It is possible to overcome some of these limitations by basing the tracking system on the FM broadcast signal which is an alternative man-made signal that is reasonably ubiquitous, provides a geographically-unique frequency spectrum and is about 100,000 times as strong as a GPS satellite signal. This allows the development of a low-cost, low-power and miniature FM receiver that can record frequency spectrums and compare them to known data in order to trace the path that the container has taken for less than $10 per container. This presents the first results of highway trials (train and sea trials are currently being conducted) of such a low-cost, covert, non-GPS based technology (called 'FM Tag') that records the worldwide displacement of containers and displays the path undertaken by the container while in transit. As an added security benefit, the tag is also capable of detecting container door openings. In addition to presenting the first trial results, this covers the innovative engineering aspects of using the metal enclosure of a maritime container as a VBF antenna, thereby eliminating the need to add an external antenna and achieving the goal of being 100% covert.","maritime containers tracking,US,Inspection,Canada,VHF antennas,Global Positioning System,FM broadcast signal,metal enclosure,Containers,Globalization,frequency spectrum,containers,market globalization,GPS,Satellite broadcasting,North America,Frequency,Road transportation,container tracking technologies,VHP antenna,Power generation economics,Security,"

"an enhanced intelligent model: to protect marine iot sensor environment using ensemble machine learning approach","2021","The research in marine sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown exponentially with the ample warehouse of natural materials in the sea. The growing activities in the marine sensor environment increased the threat of anomalies and cyber-attacks. Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and classical machine learning-based models have been proposed to secure the sensor-based IoT infrastructure. Still, these mechanisms have failed to achieve significant results for securing the marine sensor environment due to the discriminant requirements of the IoT appliances in deep oceans, such as distribution, information complexity, scalability, higher network bandwidth requirements, and low computational capacity. Hence, we propose a lightweight and robust ensemble model to secure the marine IoT environment from cyber-attacks and malicious activities. This paper established an optimized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM) algorithm for ocean IoT attack detection. The experiments were conducted on Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS) dataset. The proposed methodology includes a label encoding technique for best feature selection, hyper-parameter tuning, ensemble function, and a novel algorithm to develop an ocean IoT attack detection model. As an extension of traditional methods, the optimized Light-GBM model can handle the distributed IoT attacks in the deeper marine environments with low computational cost and with 98.52% detection accuracy. The comparative analysis confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model for marine sensor safety. Conclusively, the proposed model mitigates the threat of cyber-attacks in the marine sensor environment and presenting a promising future in real-time ocean-based IoT applications.","Marine data safety,Sensor-based infrastructure,Light-GBM,Internet of things (IoT),Machine learning,Ensemble-learning,"

"biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme for maritime cognitive radio networks","2018","Spectrum sensing is imperative to the success of maritime cognitive radio networks (MCRNs). Spectrum sensing in MCRNs is challenging because of the sea surface movement, the channel interference, and the unstable link quality. Recent research reveals that existing spectrum sensing schemes work well for lower sea states; however, they have failed to perform effectively at higher sea states. There are two disadvantages of performing spectrum sensing at higher sea states: 1) low probability of detection may also cause interference with primary system and 2) energy wastage. In this paper, a biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme (BIC3S) is proposed to deal with the reliability and energy consumption challenges associated with the sea environment. It is based on the task allocation model of an insect colony. The proposed BIC3S chooses participating secondary users for cooperative spectrum sensing according to their given sea state. Further, it enables the secondary users to decide whether or not to perform spectrum sensing based on their sea state. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of energy consumption, detection performance, and throughput. It is shown that the proposed BIC3S consumes less energy and, at the same time, achieves higher detection probability and fewer probability of false alarms compared to the existing schemes. Moreover, BIC3S provides better adaptation capabilities for the sea environment.","telecommunication network reliability,cooperative detection,cognitive radio,BIC3S,Cognitive radio network,maritime cognitive radio networks,Marine vehicles,channel interference,energy wastage,radio spectrum management,Wireless communication,task allocation model,higher sea states,unstable link quality,detection probability,low probability-of-detection,sea surface movement,sea environment,biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme,Entropy,Sea state,radio networks,maritime communication,detection performance,Biology,insect colony,cooperative communication,signal detection,probability,energy consumption,marine communication,MCRN,spectrum sensing,Detectors,"
"coastal engineering applications of high-resolution lidar bathymetry","1998","In 1994, the US Army Corps of Engineers completed development of the Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey (SHOALS) system, a state-of-the-art hydrographic survey instrument. Using lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology and operating from a Bell 212 helicopter, SHOALS remotely collects accurate, high-resolution bathymetry at a rate of 8 km2/h. A nominal depth-and-position measurement spacing of 4 m yields high-density bottom coverage of coastal projects, producing soundings from the above-water beach, or coastal structure, to depths of 40 m. Since becoming fully operational, SHOALS surveyed over 2000 km2 along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, and Caribbean Sea. Survey projects varied from tidal inlets and navigation channels to beach nourishment and monitoring. These projects quantify current coastal structure condition, navigation channel alignments, and morphologic changes over time. In addition to monitoring coastal projects, sediment transport can be estimated with accurate, high-resolution bathymetry. Bathymetry can be translated into sediment transport through a combination of the sediment continuity equation, a surf zone energetics-based longshore transport formula, and bathymetric data. This paper presents the SHOALS system describing both lidar technology and the survey system. Several SHOALS data sets are presented to show today's benefits of high-resolution lidar bathymetry to the coastal engineering community. Finally, ongoing research using these unique data sets is presented to show the future benefits of lidar bathymetry to the coastal field.","Bathymetry,Sediment transport,Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey system,"

"high resolution-optical tomography for in-process layerwise monitoring of a laser-powder bed fusion technology","2022","With the implementation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion technologies for industrial production, the need for in-process monitoring has emerged to ensure stable conditions and the process to succeed. Indeed, despite significant technological advances, the rejected parts are still too high if compared to the more conventional manufacturing techniques. Several defects are known to affect the process, more likely when complex geometries are fabricated. Among these, the production of inclined thin walls without support structures is still critical and, in most cases, geometric distortions are observed on the overhanging surfaces. In order to overcome the above mentioned problems and improve the quality of these critical structures, an high resolution monitoring system based on Optical Tomography (OT) was proposed, called High Resolution-Optical Tomography (HR-OT). It uses a very high-resolution sensor, operating in the visible spectrum of light, on a large area of the surface layers comprising the entire printing platform. This very recent technique, typically applied for the detection of volumetric defects, such as porosity or lack of fusion, was successfully applied, in this paper, for the detection of geometric distortions, allowing to avoid onerous pre-processing phases in the image processing workflow. Specific geometric indexes were selected as monitoring outputs and were used for the construction of appropriate control charts in order to carry out statistical process monitoring. Finally, an off-line 3D reconstruction, by means of digital close range photogrammetry, was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring solution when applied for in-process detection of geometric distortions.","In-process monitoring,Photogrammetry,AISI 316L,Laser-powder bed fusion,High resolution-optical tomography,"

These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives. They also provide essential elements for automated scene understanding to shift operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our learning algorithms learn behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce a massive amount of track data to a rich set of information regarding their field of regard that supports decision-making and timely response initiation. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. Deviations from normalcy result in reports being published directly to operator displays or to other reasoning components within a larger system. Deviation tolerance levels are user settable during system operation to tune alerting sensitivity. Operator (or other system component) responses to anomaly alerts can be fed back into the algorithms to further enhance and refine learned models. These algorithms have been successfully demonstrated to learn vessel behaviors across the maritime domain and to learn vehicle and dismount behavior in land-based settings.","Motion detection,Pattern analysis,Decision making,Algorithm design and analysis,Layout,Motion analysis,Computerized monitoring,Displays,Vehicles,Tracking,"

These projections involve large uncertainties, making it difficult to generalise about future changes in extreme weather and climate events. Nevertheless, it is clear that no atmospheric extreme is insensitive to future increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Projected changes in most atmospheric extremes are consistent with those detected in post-industrial records, with the rate of change sometimes accelerating, at least through to the end of the 21st century. Record-shattering extremes, nearly impossible in the absence of anthropogenic forcing, can be expected to occur in the coming decades. The chapter also considers whether these changes are, or when they are likely to become, distinguishable from natural climate variability as a result of further anthropogenic forcing.","Extreme weather and climate,Atmospheric extremes,Uncertainties,Future changes,Projections,Anthropogenic forcing,"
"study of the río de la plata turbidity front, part 1: spatial and temporal distribution","1996","The Río de la Plata is a riverine system located on the east coast of South America at 35°S. It covers 35,000 km2, it is 320 km long and 230 km wide at the mouth. The Río de la Plata drains the second largest basin in South America with an average discharge of 22,000 m3 s−1. The processes associated with the interaction of the fresh river water and the saline shelf water and tidal stirring generate a turbidity front in the outer region, which is clearly defined in the satellite images as a strong gradient in reflectance and a sharp change in water color. We use a 4 yr span of NOAA-AVHRR daily images, from September 1986 to August 1990, to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the turbidity front. Channels 1 and 2 (visible and near-infrared) are used to digitize the fronts, and channel 4 and sea surface temperature are used as complementary information for cloud detection. From a total of 2578 images, 1274 daytime images allowed us to determine 333 positions of the front. This information is used to estimate the distribution of the frontal density, a probabilistic measure of frontal occurrence. Monthly, seasonal and annual analyses were performed. The relation of the turbidity front patterns to bathymetry, tidal dynamics, river discharge and winds were investigated. A comparison between the frontal density distribution and stratification parameters is presented. The results show a high degree of variability of the frontal distribution at the northern coast of the estuary. In this region, the frontal position varies between 57°W and 54°12′W. The westernmost location occurs in the summer months, which is coincident with minimum river discharge, predominance of easterly winds and minimum occurrence of southwesterlies. The easternmost location occurs during the spring, with strong winds from the southwest. At the southern coast the modal position of the front coincides with the 5 m isobath, although great variations to this position have been observed during years of large river discharge. The fall and winter are seasons of maximum river discharge. During these periods there is a bimodal frontal distribution with maximum values of frontal density at the northern area of Bay of Samborombón and south of Montevideo, and higher variability in the center of the river.",""

In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) device for a certain time, and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity. The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts.

"variability and change in the west antarctic peninsula marine system: research priorities and opportunities","2019","The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","Primary production,Physical oceanography,Southern Ocean,Ecosystems,Sea ice,Nutrient and carbon cycling,Antarctica,Climate change,West Antarctic Peninsula,"

"chapter 9 - sources of drought early warning skill, staged prediction systems, and an example for somalia","2020","The slow onset of droughts can make them difficult to detect, but it also offers multiple opportunities for prediction before, during, and after an event. The best drought early warning systems utilize multiple sources of information in appropriate ways, taking advantage of each information source’s strengths. Predictive skill comes from slow changes in ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated climate, atmospheric weather patterns, and variations in land surface moisture and vegetation conditions. Slowly varying climate patterns, driven primarily by SSTs, can provide support for long-term forecasts. Then on 1- to 14-day timescales, predictions of weather systems can inform drought outlooks. Finally, weather observations, and the land surface response to these surface forcings provide lagged but reliable information on drought conditions and impacts. In general, as we transition from climate to weather to land information, we find increases in accuracy and spatial resolution but decreases in lead time. Before the season, statistical or dynamic climate forecasts can provide coarse projections of seasonal rainfall or reference evapotranspiration (RefET). As the season commences, observations or weather forecasts of these indicators provide rapidly available information; combining observations and weather forecasts can provide powerful mid-season indicators. Finally, late in the season, estimates of runoff, soil moisture, and vegetation can provide excellent sources of information that relate directly to hydrologic or agropastoral drought impacts and related food and livestock price variations. These land surface responses temporally lag rainfall but also provide high-quality information about impacts. Combining multiple sources of information in a defense-in-depth strategy provides multiple chances to detect droughts, greatly enhancing system performance, while also leveraging multiple sources of information. Here, we describe how such systems can be developed and provide examples for Somalia—one of the most drought prone and food insecure countries in the world.","drought forcing,drought management,drought prediction,Drought,prediction,"

"clutter suppression and target tracking by the low-rank representation for airborne maritime surveillance radar","2020","Moving target detection is of vital importance to maritime security and maritime resource protection. However, the detection of slow or weak targets is difficult based on traditional methods. A new detection method is proposed by using the different motion variations of radar moving target and sea clutter in the range-Doppler spectrum sequence. The first step in implementing this method is the separation of moving target and sea clutter by the low-rank representation, in which the target and clutter are modeled as foreground and background components. Subsequently, a sea clutter discriminator is constructed within the sea clutter bandwidth to further remove the sea clutter (false alarms) that exists in the foreground. The proposed method can reduce the sea clutter power while maintaining the target power and improve the detection rate of moving targets, especially slow or weak targets. Data collected with airborne maritime surveillance radar in maritime moving target indication (MMTI) mode are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) obtained with the proposed method is better than that obtained with space-time adaptive processing (STAP, including 1DT-STAP, 3DT-STAP and sparse-STAP) and principal component pursuit (PCP) methods; additionally, the figure of merit (FOM) of the proposed method is higher than that of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and PCP method.

"silver fluxes to the gironde estuary – eleven years (1999–2009) of monitoring at the watershed scale","2011","Although Ag has long been recognized as highly toxic to aquatic organisms and as an efficient tracer of urban wastewater inputs, there are very few data available on Ag levels and fluxes in rivers and estuaries. Due to anomalously high Ag concentrations in oysters from the estuary mouth, dissolved (AgD) and particulate Ag (AgP) concentrations in rivers of the Gironde Estuary watershed were studied. Using daily discharge, Suspended particulate matter (SPM) data and monthly measured AgD and AgP, the respective fluxes were estimated at the three main entries of the Gironde Estuary and at selected key sites at the outlets of different sub-watersheds for multiple years of the past decade. Dissolved and particulate Ag concentrations were 0.5ng/L (detection limit) to 5.7ng/L and 0.13–13.9mg/kg in all rivers, except for the Riou-Mort River (up to 1260ng/L and 261mg/kg) that has been heavily polluted by former Zn ore treatment and remaining waste tailings. At all sites Ag transport mainly (73–100%) occurred in the particulate phase, i.e. strongly depended on hydrological parameters. Comparing Th-normalised (i.e. grain size independent) AgP levels at the different sites including one remote site showed that the regional background is best described by AgP/ThP=0.026. The anthropogenic components in AgP levels and fluxes ranged from 24% to 90% at all sites, except for the Riou-Mort River (81–99%). Although this former ore treatment site still is an evident Ag source to the Lot-Garonne fluvial–estuarine system, its contribution to Ag fluxes at the main entry of the Gironde Estuary (i.e. 0.33–2.44t/a at the La Reole site) is <11%. This clearly suggests that other sources such as rock weathering and erosion (0.057–0.817t/a), urban wastewater inputs (0.042–0.057t/a) and cloud-seeding (0.030–0.063t/a) contribute the major parts of the fluvial Ag budget in this watershed. The estimated anthropogenic surface- and population-specific Ag fluxes in the studied system were 1.14–682g/km2/a and 0.028–6.05g/person/a, respectively. The results obtained suggest that the Gironde fluvial–estuarine system is contaminated by Ag inputs from various sources, but further work is necessary to (i) identify and quantify the major sources and (ii) produce comparable data for other systems, which would be useful for the evaluation of Ag contamination at a larger scale.",""
"chapter 4 - preventing system intrusions","2013","Intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion detection and attempting to stop detected possible incidents. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) focus primarily on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators. In addition, organizations use IPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events, and produce reports. Many IPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack’s content. This chapter describes the characteristics of IPS technologies and provides recommendations for designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining them. The types of IPS technologies are differentiated primarily by the types of events that they monitor and the ways in which they are deployed.","digital attacks,phishing,crackers,intrusion prevention systems,hacker,malware,cybersecurity,daemons,cybercrime,TCP/IP,"
"open data for anomaly detection in maritime surveillance","2013","Maritime surveillance has received increased attention from a civilian perspective in recent years. Anomaly detection is one of many techniques available for improving the safety and security in this domain. Maritime authorities use confidential data sources for monitoring the maritime activities; however, a paradigm shift on the Internet has created new open sources of data. We investigate the potential of using open data as a complementary resource for anomaly detection in maritime surveillance. We present and evaluate a decision support system based on open data and expert rules for this purpose. We conduct a case study in which experts from the Swedish coastguard participate to conduct a real-world validation of the system. We conclude that the exploitation of open data as a complementary resource is feasible since our results indicate improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing surveillance systems by increasing the accuracy and covering unseen aspects of maritime activities.","Anomaly detection,Maritime security,Maritime domain awareness,Open data,"
"the effectiveness of dazzlers for maritime security","2010","A dazzler, sometimes called an optical distracter, transmits a visually intense light, usually in a narrow beam, in order to 1) attract the attention of a person and to make them alert to other visual or audible warnings against approaching a protected asset in a threatening manner, or 2) to suppress the actions of noncompliant persons (continued advance or aiming of weapons) by obscuring their vision with disability glare. Dazzlers feature in land operations, at military check points in non-combat land operations, to momentarily distract an assailant, to alert drivers in vehicles approaching a check point, and to alert civilian traffic to approaching forces. Dazzlers are being considered for maritime security; for port protection, counter piracy, and critical infrastructure protection to warn the occupants of small boats and for suppressing the vision of noncompliant persons who may be intent on attacking. The distances of initial detection and warning for maritime operations are generally much longer (on the order of 300 to 3000 m) than the distances in land operations (50 to 300 m). Dazzler aiming is furthermore likely to be under automatic control rather than handheld as in land operations, in order to more control dwell time against a distant contact, and to provide a large operator-dazzler separation for operator safety in counter piracy. The requirements for dazzler effectiveness therefore change when going from land operations to maritime. Models of disability glare are used here to model and study the effectiveness of dazzlers for maritime security across changing ambient light conditions, with aiming uncertainties, and for different types of sources (coherent lasers versus incoherent spotlights). Key requirements for specifying a dazzler system are considered.","dazzler effectiveness,Lighting,Safety,military equipment,Disability Glare,Optical Distractor,Spotlight,Maritme Security,maritime security,optical distracter,noncombat land operations,military check points,Response Measures,visually intense light,marine safety,disability glare,Humans,laser beam applications,Laser beams,Uncertainty,Weapons,Visualization,laser dazzler,security,Laser Dazzler,automatic control,"
"magnetic anomaly detection of adjacent parallel pipelines using deep learning neural networks","2022","Magnetic anomaly detection is becoming increasingly prevalent for detecting and locating the buried pipelines. The detection performance is often hindered by adjacent pipeline, near-field ferromagnetic objects and random noises. In order to overcome these obstacles, a magnetic anomaly detection method based on deep learning neural networks (DLNN) is proposed to decouple and denoise the integrated detection to accurately extract the magnetic anomaly of single pipeline. The theoretical derivation of the vertical component of magnetic anomaly was executed based on Poisson's equation. Then the integrated detection was simulated by summing magnetic anomalies of parallel pipelines and metal sphere, as well as white Gaussian noise. The DLNN was constructed with improved optimization design, and trained using supervised learning method. The results show that the proposed method exhibits almost immune to random noises, the prediction accuracy approaches to 90% with signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB. Meanwhile, the predictive accuracy is still above 80% with interferences both from near-field ferromagnetic objects and random noises with SNR of 30 dB. The method becomes practically significant in the development of geomagnetic inspection instruments for the adjacent parallel pipelines.","Magnetic anomaly detection,Neural networks,Deep learning,Adjacent parallel pipelines,"
"trajectory pattern extraction and anomaly detection for maritime vessels","2021","Trajectory analysis and extraction of trajectory patterns are crucial to enhance marine safety and marine status awareness. The major data source for such analysis is Automatic Identification System (AIS), which publishes data related to movement of the ship while cruising. AIS broadcasts information including type of ship, identity number, state, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), location, speed, direction, and cargo. In this paper, we focus on extracting a variety of trajectory patterns for maritime vessels. The first group of analysis we focus on is arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, which are useful to aid maritime operators. We propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. As the second type of analysis, anomaly detection on marine vessel trajectory is studied. For vessel movement prediction, the experiments show that the proposed solutions brought improvement against conventional supervised learning approaches. The proposed anomaly detection technique is demonstrated on a case study.","Trajectory,Maritime,LSTM,Next position prediction,Anomaly detection,Arrival port prediction,Arrival time prediction,Supervised learning,AIS,"

Every formula in the knowledge base is assigned a weight indicating its confidence. Different types of knowledge with associated uncertainty can therefore be fused together within MLNs and on-line inference can be performed as input data is processed by the system, and the formulas are grounded in the knowledge base.

"paleotemperature reconstructions using speleothem fluid inclusion analyses from hungary","2021","The combined use of the stable isotope compositions of speleothem carbonate and inclusion-hosted water presents great potential in paleotemperature reconstructions, due to the various temperature-dependent isotope fractionations detected in cave systems and their environment. This paper evaluates the applicational possibilities of hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements of inclusion-hosted water and its host calcite, in three different approaches: i) direct determination of calcite-water oxygen isotope fractionation by measuring inclusion water and carbonate compositions, ii) calculation of water oxygen isotope composition from hydrogen isotope data and of temperature from the inferred calcite-water fractionation, and iii) calculation of formation temperature from measured hydrogen isotope data and its temperature dependence in the modern precipitation water. Fluid inclusion oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions as well as calcite oxygen isotope compositions were determined for five speleothem occurrences in Hungary. Although the background processes are not resolved, calculations involving measured calcite and water oxygen isotope compositions yielded unrealistic paleotemperatures, likely because of syn-formation isotope fractionation processes and diagenetic alterations. The hydrogen isotope data may yield realistic temperatures, provided that long-term isotopic composition - temperature relationships are known and the stable hydrogen isotope composition of the precipitation waters in the study area is temperature-controlled. Winter half-year and annual isotope-temperature relationships (δ2H/T gradients) were calculated using multidecadal isotope composition records from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), gridded surface temperatures, and precipitation amounts from the E-OBS 21.0e database. The calculations yielded a paleotemperature record for the last ~250 ka, with average precisions ranging from ±0.6 °C for interglacial to ±2.4 °C for glacial periods. Clumped isotope analyses of cave-hosted flowstones support the inferred formation temperatures based on gradients, while detection of kinetic fractionations by combined hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of calcite and inclusion water lead to filtering clumped isotope (Δ47) data and more coherent Δ47-temperature relationships.","Fluid inclusion,Paleotemperature reconstruction,Clumped isotope,Speleothem,Stable isotope composition,Calcite,"

"improving maritime situational awareness by fusing sensor information and intelligence","2011","In present-day military security operations threats are more difficult to reveal than in conventional warfare theatres, since they take place during the course of normal life. These maritime missions often take place in littoral environments, where acts of piracy, drug trafficking and other threatening events become obscured in the crowd of everyday fisheries, cargo traders, ferries and pleasure cruises, hindering situation awareness. We aim to improve situation awareness and threat detection capabilities in maritime scenarios by combining sensor-based information with context information and intelligence from various sources. The fusion and analysis in order to reveal suspect from normal behavior is based on domain ontologies. A test bed allows the study of various exploitation and assessments techniques applied to these domain ontologies.

We evaluated the out-of-the-box performance of three state-of-the-art CNN-based object detection algorithms (Faster R-CNN [1], R-FCN [2] and SSD [3]) on these datasets and compared them in terms of accuracy and run-time. The algorithms were previously trained on the COCO dataset [4]. We explore their performance based on different feature extractors. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of the object size on the algorithm performance.

"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments. Several quantitative and qualitative experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories.

"requirement on antenna cross-polarization isolation for the operational use of c-band sar constellations in maritime surveillance","2010","The issue of antenna cross-polarization isolation has been previously discussed for the design of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs). Dual-polarized antennas with cross-polarization isolation that is better than -30 dB are desirable for more convenient polarimetric data calibration since measurements of antenna crosstalk (magnitude and phase) variations with incidence angle are not required. For an antenna with significant polarization crosstalk, it is still possible to retrieve pure polarization measurements of HH, HV, VH, and VV provided that the four corresponding received voltages are measured. However, it is not possible to recover from cross-polarization contamination for single- or dual-polarization measurements. Therefore, it is important to set up a minimum requirement on dual-polarized antenna isolation so that single- and dual-polarization applications are not unduly affected. In this letter, the minimum requirement on cross-polarization antenna isolation is investigated for operational use of C-band SARs in maritime surveillance applications. Calibrated polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data are used to simulate single- and dual-polarization data with cross-polarization contamination for a dual-polarized antenna with cross-polarization isolation ranging from -20 to -35 dB. It is shown that the cross-polarization HV (or VH) channel can be significantly affected, particularly at steep incidence angles. As a result, key applications that require the use of pure HV, such as ship detection and wind-speed measurements, are significantly affected. A requirement for a minimum of -30-dB antenna isolation is established. Antennas with cross-polarization isolation better than -35 dB are desirable for reliable exploitation of HV data at steep incidence angles.","multipolarization,antenna crosstalk,ship detection,Antenna measurements,Aperture antennas,antenna cross-polarization isolation,Pollution measurement,wind-speed measurement,synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry,C-band SAR constellations,Antenna,Contamination,maritime surveillance,dual-polarized antennas,synthetic aperture radar,polarization crosstalk,search radar,Phase measurement,polarimetric synthetic aperture radars,Crosstalk,Polarization,Calibration,dual polarization,calibration,radar polarimetry,Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar,Surveillance,crosstalk,RADARSAT-2,"

A general expert knowledge base for the fault diagnosis of RTO system is constructed. And the anomaly alarm thresholds are modified according to historical data with n-sigma rules to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Results on different cases show advantages in both triggering early anomaly alarms and avoiding invalid alarms, which is crucial to improve the fault inference accuracy.

"textual risk mining for maritime situational awareness","2014","In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called â€œriskâ€ if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times.

"a realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells","2019","Detection of undesirable events in oil and gas wells can help prevent production losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties and reduce maintenance costs. The scarcity of measurements in such processes is a drawback due to the low reliability of instrumentation in such hostile environments. Another issue is the absence of adequately structured data related to events that should be detected. To contribute to providing a priori knowledge about undesirable events for diagnostic algorithms in offshore naturally flowing wells, this work presents an original and valuable dataset with instances of eight types of undesirable events characterized by eight process variables. Many hours of expert work were required to validate historical instances and to produce simulated and hand-drawn instances that can be useful to distinguish normal and abnormal actual events under different operating conditions. The choices made during this dataset's preparation are described and justified, and specific benchmarks that practitioners and researchers can use together with the published dataset are defined. This work has resulted in two relevant contributions. A challenging public dataset that can be used as a benchmark for the development of (i) machine learning techniques related to inherent difficulties of actual data, and (ii) methods for specific tasks associated with detecting and diagnosing undesirable events in offshore naturally flowing oil and gas wells. The other contribution is the proposal of the defined benchmarks.","Multivariate time series classification,Abnormal event management,Fault detection and diagnosis,Oil well monitoring,"
"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"
"long-term river discharge and multidecadal climate variability inferred from varved sediments, southwest alaska","2011","Sedimentological analyses of 289years (AD 1718–2006) of varved sediment from Shadow Bay, southwest Alaska, were used to investigate hydroclimate variability during and prior to the instrumental period. Varve thicknesses relate most strongly to total annual discharge (r2=0.75, n=43, p<0.0001). Maximum annual grain size depends most strongly on maximum spring daily discharge (r2=0.63, n=43, p<0.0001) and maximum annual daily discharge (r2=0.61, n=43, p<0.0001), while varve thickness is poorly correlated with maximum annual grain size (r2=0.004, n=287, p=0.33). Relations between varve thickness and annual climate variables (temperature, precipitation, North Pacific (NP) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices) are insignificant. On multidecadal timescales, however, regime shifts in varve thickness and total annual discharge coincide with shifts in NP and PDO indices. Periods with increased varve thickness and total annual discharge were associated with warm PDO phases and a strengthened Aleutian Low. The varve-inferred record of PDO suggests that any periodicity in the PDO varied over time, and that the early 19th century marked a transition to a more frequent or detectable shifts.","Discharge,Varves,Pacific Decadal Oscillation,North Pacific Index,Aleutian Low,Southwest Alaska,Climate variability,"

"comparison of the impacts of elevated co2 soil gas concentrations on selected european terrestrial environments","2015","Selected European studies have illustrated the impacts of elevated CO2 concentrations in shallow soils on pasture. For the first time, general unified conclusions can be made, providing CO2 thresholds where effects on plants and soil microbiology are observed and making recommendations on how this information can be used when planning projects for CO2 storage. The sites include those where CO2 is being naturally released to the atmosphere from deep geological formations; and a non-adapted site, with no previous history of CO2 seepage, where CO2 has been injected into the unsaturated soil horizon. Whilst soil gas concentrations will be influenced by flux rates and other factors, the results suggest that a concentration of between 10% and 15% CO2 soil gas at 20cm depth, which is within the root zone, is an important threshold level for observing changes in plant coverage. Site-specific plant ‘indicators’ are also observed for CO2 concentrations at ≥35%. Microbiological changes are seen where CO2 soil gas concentrations are between 15% and 40%. As part of site characterisation, an evaluation of the risks of leakage and their potential environmental impacts should be undertaken.","CO storage,Leakage detection,Environmental impacts,Site monitoring,Controlled injection,Leakage,Natural systems,"
"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data. The statistical analysis on the discovered sets of conflict trajectory is able to provide useful knowledge for maritime traffic monitoring.","maritime traffic situation awareness,maritime traffic monitoring,maritime shipping traffic,maritime traffic conflict,maritime AIS traffic data,collision situations,Safety,maritime traffic data,Automatic Identification System network,Marine vehicles,AIS network,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,real AIS data,terrestrial AIS receivers,pattern clustering,Trajectory data mining,Artificial intelligence,safety control,conflict behaviors,clustering-and-detection,AIS data,Roads,Trajectory,conflict trajectory,conflict situation,Conflict detection,Maritime traffic data,Navigation,navigation,nearby ships,collision avoidance,Data mining,navigational collisions,maritime traffic managers,Navigation collision,"
"application of track-before-detect techniques in gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance","2019","GNSS-based passive radar has been recently proved able to enable moving target detection in maritime surveillance applications. The main restriction lies in the low Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) level of navigation satellites. Extending the integration times with proper target motion compensation has been shown to be a viable solution to improve ship detectability, but this involves computational complexity and increasing sensitivity to motion model mismatches. In this work, we consider the application of a Track-Before-Detect (TBD) method to considerably increase the integration time (and therefore the detection capability) at the same time keeping the computational complexity affordable by practical systems. Dynamic programming TBD algorithms have been specialized for the considered framework and tested against experimental dataset. The obtained results show the effectiveness of this approach to improve the detection capability of the system despite the restricted power budget.","Satellites,moving target detection,long-integration time,marine radar,radar detection,passive radar,track-before-detect,Program processors,ship detectability,satellite navigation,track-before-detect techniques,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,track-before-detect method,search radar,motion model mismatches,Radar tracking,Doppler effect,integration time,radar tracking,low equivalent isotropic radiated power level,maritime surveillance applications,restricted power budget,Passive radar,marine communication,GNSS-based passive radar,Surveillance,detection capability,target motion compensation,"

Finding outliers in a collection of patterns among AIS trajectories is critical for real time applications ranging from military surveillance to transportation management.

First, we apply Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to generate patterns from original trajectories. Second, we extract gravity vectors and sample stop points from clusters to retain stop and move information and to reduce the further computation cost. To measure the similarity between trajectory points and clusters, cluster relative distance and cluster angular distance are proposed.

"climate warming and permafrost dynamics in the antarctic peninsula region","2013","Dramatic warming of the climate over the last several decades has influenced the properties and distribution of permafrost in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Five approaches were used to estimate the distribution of permafrost in the region: (1) correlation of permafrost distribution with mean annual air temperature isotherms, (2) mapping the distribution of periglacial features indicative of permafrost, (3) summarizing data from shallow excavations and boreholes, (4) detection of permafrost from geophysical techniques, and (5) application of models to predict the occurrence of permafrost. Whereas permafrost is continuous in the South Orkney Islands (60–61°S) and along the eastern Antarctic Peninsula (63–65°S), it is discontinuous in the South Shetland Islands (62–63°S), and occurs only sporadically in the Palmer Archipelago and Biscoe Islands along the western Antarctic Peninsula (64–66°S). Permafrost then becomes continuous on Alexander Island (71–74°S) along the western Antarctic Peninsula as the maritime climate shifts to a more continental climate. Reports prior to 1980 mention the presence of permafrost at depths of 25 to 35cm in ice-free areas near Palmer Station (64°46′S; 64°04′W), where the mean annual air temperature from extrapolation of data from the nearby Vernadsky Station has increased 3.4°C and the mean winter temperature has increased 6°C since 1950. Recent measurements suggest that permafrost is absent or close to 0°C in the upper 14m of the highest ice-free areas (67ma.s.l.) near Palmer Station. Permafrost temperatures elsewhere along the western Antarctic Peninsula region range from −0.4 to −1.8°C in the South Shetland Islands (62–63°S) to −3.1°C at Adelaide Island (67°34′S). Permafrost at this temperature is susceptible to thawing, which has resulted in historic increases in active-layer thicknesses and in thermokarst features such as debris flows, and active-layer detachment slides.","Active-layer,Periglacial features,Temperature gradient,Permafrost,Ground surface temperature,Boreholes,"

"maritime border security using sensors, processing, and platforms to detect dark vessels","2018","Maritime security is critical to national prosperity, but with a large area to be secured and limited resources available, our current maritime situational awareness is not sufficient to secure our borders. This challenge is compounded by the fact that many bad actors intentionally avoid using transponders to obscure their location and actions for nefarious purposes. New solutions are required to detect these â€œdarkâ€ vessels in the expansive maritime domain and thereby enable increased maritime situational awareness and security. In this paper, we present a concept for increased maritime situational awareness, specifically designed to secure our borders against dark vessels using a novel combination of existing technologies.

"iso-kinematic maps from statistical analysis of ps-insar data of piemonte, nw italy: comparison with geological kinematic trends","2011","SAR interferometry based on Permanent Scatterers (PS-InSAR™) is used here to study the present crustal mobility of a large area of NW Italy, in the Piemonte region. Thirty-eight satellite scenes (ERS SAR), taken from May 1992 to January 2001, were analysed for detecting more than 2million PS on the study area. Continuous velocity surface maps (Iso-Kinematic Maps: IKM) were obtained from geo-statistical and spatial cluster techniques (Hot Spot analysis) of PS “short-period” data, to identify relative ground motions and to compare them with “long-period” tectonic mobility trends, i.e. those inferred at regional scale over geological times (some million years). The comparison was made by individuation of homogeneous kinematic areas, represented in the IKM, and characterization of the boundaries between them (Iso-Kinematic Boundaries: IKB). The IKB were used as tools to asses if the PS-InSAR data on present-day crustal mobility could fit with the distribution of real tectonic structures or field geological elements. IKM were drawn for uplifting geological sectors of Piemonte (Maritime Alps, Gran Paradiso, Langhe) where moderate to very low seismicity is recorded, and gravitational instabilities of rock mass on mountain slopes are widespread. The land sectors have been chosen in order to test the suitability of IKM in very different geo-morphological conditions. Different types of correspondence between the IKM and the geological kinematic trend were found:-a first type in which the kinematic trend of short-period (a decade of years, i.e. the PS-InSAR detection time span) is in agreement with a long-period tectonic trend (some million years) and seem to be driven by well known faults subparallel to the IKB. These kinematic trends can be hidden by the slope movement due to gravitational instabilities;-a second type in which the kinematic trend of short-period does not strictly correspond to the long-period trend, but can be considered as minor-order, uplifting-subsidence cycles, even if in contrast with the long-period kinematic trend. Alternatively, the short-period kinematic trends could reflect the action of deep-seated geological forces or structures, not yet known or inferable (at least with the recorded PS-InSAR velocities) on the basis of the available geological data and models.",""

"a real-time scene parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation","2023","On the sea, scene parsing, one of the most basic environmental perception methods for autonomous tasks, helps autonomous devices safely navigate and avoid obstacles. However, most of the existing methods lack real-time performance and have difficulty accurately detecting small obstacles and changeable textures. We, therefore, propose a real-time scene-parsing network for autonomous maritime transportation. Specifically, we first design a lightweight model framework and then explore three efficient loss functions, such that a balance between accuracy and real-time performance can be achieved. The first loss function is an obstacle-weighted loss, which improves the extraction of small obstacles by analyzing the distribution law of obstacles at sea. The second one is a detail loss, which optimizes the detail segmentation at complex contours by emphasizing edge features. The last one is an affinity loss, utilizing the context dependency between features to accurately detect reflections, ripples, and other changeable textures. In addition, a new maritime sense-parsing dataset called Greater Bay Area (GBA) dataset is proposed and made publicly available.

The data fusion capacity can enhance the situation awareness of ASVs, leading to improved efficacy and safety in ASV-empowered maritime IoT (MIoT). Both cameras and automatic identification system (AIS) equipment, which provide visual and positioning information, respectively, have become the commonly adopted cost-effective sensors. In this work, we first introduce a lightweight YOLOX-s network with transfer learning to accurately and robustly detect the moving vessels at different scales in real time. A data augmentation method is then proposed to promote its generalization ability. The detected vessels and synchronous AIS messages are finally fused to make full use of the multi-source sensing data, contributing to an augmented reality (AR)-based maritime navigation system at the shipborne intelligent edges. The AR system is able to superimpose both static and dynamic information from the collected AIS messages onto the video-captured images. It has the capacity of providing auxiliary information for early warning of navigation risks for ASVs in MIoT networks.

Clinical data were obtained by chart review and electroretinogram testing. Mutations in the PAX6 gene were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism and characterized by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Eleven different PAX6 mutations, 10 of which are novel, were found. The four patients with congenital cataracts all had mutations in the C-terminal proline-serine-threonine (PST)–rich domain of the PAX6 protein. Electroretinograms of nine of 11 patients displayed depressed scotopic maximum response b-wave amplitudes.

"effects of precipitation and landuse on runoff during the past 50 years in a typical watershed in loess plateau, china","2009","In the past century, great progress has been made worldwide in our understanding of forest-water relationship. The successful forestation programs implemented in China-which have improved the ecological environmental conditions-have gained the attention of many researchers and highlighted the relationship between forestation and water yields. The arid and semi-arid Loess Plateau has received attention from water engineers and eco-hydrological researchers in China because of a shortage in water resources. We selected one of the oldest stations conducting soil and water conservation experiments, the Xifeng soil and water conservation station, and chose the Nanxiaohe catchment and its paired catchments (Yangjiagou catchment and Dongzhuanggou catchment) as our research areas. Trends in precipitation, air temperature, streamflow over the past 50 years, and the effect of changing land use on streamflow were analyzed. The Mann-Kendall test showed that precipitation had a negative trend (downward trend), whereas air temperature showed a positive trend (upward trend) from the past to present in the Nanxiaohe catchment. However, the trends seen in precipitation, air temperature did not contain any “jumping points.” The paired catchment approach is used to detect the effects of land cover change on hydrology in the Yangjiagou and the contrast catchment, i.e., Dongzhuanggou catchment in our study. The results showed a large change in land use in the Yangjiagou catchment from 1954 to 2008. An increase in forested land (from 0% to 40.08% from 1954 to 2008) and a reduction of bare land (from 51.26% to 5.50% from 1954 to 2008) accounted for a large part of the change in land use. However, the land use changed little in the contrast catchment. The comparison of streamflow in the paired catchments showed that forestation reduced streamflow by 49.63% (or 6.5 mm) each year.","Surface water hydrology,Loess Plateau of China,Forests,Land use/land cover change,Climate variability/change,"

In this context, this work proposes a data-driven framework for supporting the analysis of the production processes in terms of failures and related effects through the well-known and widely applied Failure Mode, Effect, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). Indeed, after developing the Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis, the results obtained for the plant under investigation are elaborated through Machine Learning techniques such as the Association Rule Mining to define the cause-effect relationships that led to a failure. The association rules extracted are then processed through the Social Network Analysis to represent such relationships, facilitate their comprehension, and identify the existence of communities of nodes to detect critical patterns and locate the most influential nodes. The knowledge of such details can provide helpful support in terms of awareness of the plant and the development of intelligent maintenance procedures. The proposed approach is applied to an off-shore and on-shore platform to assess the impact of the theoretical analysis on the practical implementation by highlighting unknown relations among the analyzed variables and showing new cause-effect relationships.","Machine Learning,Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis,Risk-Based Maintenance,Association Rule Mining,Data-driven approach,Social Network Analysis,"

"fitting empirical distributions for vessels behavioural analysis and maritime anomaly detection","2023","Naval behaviour characterization and maritime anomaly detection represents two active area of research. Although multiple probabilistic approaches have been implemented for explaining different parametric maritime phenomena, most of them are focused only on the analysis of primary kinematic data, such as position, speed, course of vessels, or lateral displacement relative to an obstacle. This article presents an analysis on multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages collected in the Black Sea region. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal). Finally, there were extracted the parameters that best fitted these distributions. Also, a universal parametric distribution was searched to best fit all observed maritime activities.","statistical distributions,universal parametric distribution,kernel density estimation applications,Safety,primary kinematic data,AIS messages,vessel behavioural analysis,Sea measurements,cumulative distribution functions,parametric maritime phenomena,probabilistic approaches,quantitative histograms,marine engineering,hidden activities,AIS,vessels behaviour,Probabilistic logic,Probability distribution,probability distribution fitting,Measurement,maritime anomaly detection,Statistical analysis,empirical distributions,naval behaviour characterization,Fitting,Black Sea region,empirical data,data handling,multiple complex maritime activities,"
"fault detection and diagnosis of a blade pitch system in a floating wind turbine based on kalman filters and artificial neural networks","2021","This paper describes the development of a fault detection and diagnosis method to automatically identify different fault conditions of a hydraulic blade pitch system in a spar-type floating wind turbine. For fault detection, a Kalman filter is employed to estimate the blade pitch angle and valve spool position of the blade pitch system. The fault diagnosis scheme is based on an artificial neural network method with supervised learning that is capable of diagnosing a predetermined fault type. The neural network algorithm produces a predictive model with training, validation and test procedures after the final performance evaluation. The validation and test procedures of the artificial neural network model are conducted with the training model to prove the model performance. The proposed method is demonstrated in case studies of a spar floating wind turbine with stochastic wind and wave conditions and with consideration of six different types of faults, such as biases and fixed outputs in pitch sensors and excessive friction, slit-lock, wrong voltage, and circuit shortage in actuators. The fault diagnosis results from the final performance evaluation show that the proposed methods work effectively with good performance.","Kalman filter,Floating wind turbine,Blade pitch actuator and sensor faults,Hydraulic pitch system,Artificial neural network,Fault detection and diagnosis,"
"data-driven fraud detection in international shipping","2018","Document fraud constitutes a growing problem in international shipping. Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits.","Neural networks,International shipping,Fraud detection,Logistic regression,Bayesian networks,Probablistic classification,"

"satellite-derived bathymetry for maritime archaeology: testing its effectiveness at two ancient harbours in the eastern mediterranean","2021","High-resolution bathymetry is an essential tool in maritime archaeology, often used for underwater prospection, imaging, palaeo-landscape reconstruction and change detection. The commonest acquisition method relies on shipborne acoustic systems (e.g. multibeam echosounder). However, most of the world’s seabed has not been surveyed using these methods. Derivation of bathymetry from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry: SDB) can redress this in shallow (<20–30 m depth) clear water. It can be derived empirically using depth control points, or independent of control data through physics-based approaches. Given global satellite coverage, it is applicable almost anywhere with suitable water conditions and is becoming increasingly widespread in the hydrographic survey community. However, archaeological application of SDB is almost totally un-investigated. This paper examines the utility of SDB for maritime archaeology through 2 case studies: the ancient harbours of Tyre (Lebanon) and Ras Ibn Hani (Syria). Tested data comprise 2 m-resolution physics-based commercial SDB and medium-resolution (10–30 m) SDB empirically derived from open access multispectral imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). SDB was assessed for its ability to detect submerged cultural features and landforms and as input into palaeo-geographic reconstructions. Tested SDB performed poorly for feature detection, but was better-suited to landform identification and palaeo-geographic reconstruction. SDB also has clear advantages: low cost, wide area coverage, speed and data availability. Disadvantages include variable accuracy, technical limitations (e.g. need for clear water) and approach-specific requirements (e.g. depth control points for empirical and complex modelling for physics-based approaches). For maritime archaeology, its current limitations means that it will not replace acoustics for prospection and imaging but it does have utility for submerged landscape investigation and reconstruction, particularly in areas which now only have no/poor bathymetric data.","Bathymetry,SDB,Submerged landscapes,Geoarchaeology,Shipwrecks,Satellite imagery,"
"collaborative autonomous multi-vessel detection, bounding, and containment for maritime environmental disasters","2017","This paper demonstrates the process of adapting publicly available repositories for the MOOS-IvP middleware to efficiently create and solve problems for collaborative marine autonomy. The problem introduced in this paper addresses a collaborative approach for autonomous environmental anomaly detection, bounding, and containment. An environmental anomaly may be an oil spill, radioactive contamination, or other similar undesirable and detectable event. A simulated oil spill anomaly was introduced into the maritime environment. Multiple autonomous vessels searched an area and discovered the anomaly. Upon detection, one vessel continued to search the larger area for additional spills. The second vessel began a dedicated survey of the spill area to determine the severity, approximate bounding dimensions, and spreading, if any. Upon completing its survey to a reasonable level of confidence, another vessel confirmed the boundary then surrounded the bounded spill area with an oil boom to prevent further spreading. Vessels provided detailed spill reports throughout the survey and bounding process. A final spill report was sent to the shore side control station with the overall dimensions of the spill as well as the location and dimensions of the bounding oil boom that was laid.

"ship fuel consumption monitoring and fault detection via partial least squares and control charts of navigation data","2019","New regulations in the shipping sector aim to give greater transparency to operations and public access to CO2 emissions data. EU regulation 2015/757 became mandatory in January 2018 and urges shipping companies to set up systems for daily monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions for individual ships. Manual acquisition and handling of emissions data may be allowed (e.g. bunker fuel delivery note, bunker fuel tank monitoring), but is adversely affected by uncertainty due to human intervention and will eventually be unusable for monitoring purposes. However, the massive amounts of navigation data acquired by multi-sensor systems installed on-board of modern ships have great potential to aid compliance with regulations but their use is hampered by the lack of effective analytical methods in the maritime literature. This work demonstrates a statistical framework and automatic reporting system for fuel consumption monitoring that addresses the MRV requirements needed to comply with the regulations. The framework has been applied to the Grimaldi Group’s Ro-Ro Pax cruise ships and is shown, in addition, to be capable of supporting fault detection as well as verifying CO2 savings achieved after energy efficiency initiatives.","MRV,Partial least squares regression,Vessel energy efficiency,Hotelling’s T control chart,CO emission monitoring,Squared prediction error control chart,"

"maritime moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar with gnss transmitters","2017","The paper puts forward a moving target detection technique for passive bistatic radar systems based on GNSS signals for maritime surveillance applications. If from one hand navigation satellites are extremely attractive as opportunistic sources for passive radar due to their global coverage and the availability of multiple satellites, on the other hand they provide a restricted power budget. To strengthen the target energy sufficiently to allow its detection, observation time has to be increased up to several tens of seconds. This requires the need to develop innovative techniques able to deal with such long integration times. In this paper, a local plane-based maritime moving target detection (M-MTD) technique is proposed. Such a technique performs the integration of the received signal for a long integration time, properly taking into account the migration of the moving target during the entire dwell time. Moreover, it provides target detection in the local plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna. Since this plane is common to multiple transmitters, the proposed technique can be easily extended to the multistatic case, which is the bigger benefit in using GNSS sources. Simulated and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed M-MTD technique to detect ship targets, not detectable with conventional MTD techniques, with the GNSS-based passive radar.","Satellites,marine radar,Radar antennas,radar detection,passive radar,M-MTD technique,radar antennas,marine navigation,Transmitters,received signal integration,satellite navigation,target energy,local plane-based maritime moving target detection technique,ship target detection,radar antenna,search radar,Doppler effect,restricted power budget,maritime surveillance applications,Passive radar,Object detection,spaceborne radar,passive bistatic radar system,GNSS transmitters,"
"trends and changes in tropical and summer days at the adana sub-region of the mediterranean region, southern turkey","2017","In this study, the long-term variability and trends of the annual and seasonal numbers of summer and tropical days of the Adana Sub-region were investigated using nonlinear and linear trend detection tests for the period 1960–2014 at 14 meteorological stations. The results suggest that the annual number of summer and tropical days was generally below the long-term average through to the end of the 1980s. In particular, positive anomaly values could be observed at all stations between the years 1993–2014. With respect to the Kruskal-Wallis homogeneity test, the significant breaking date was 1993. The rapid rise of the annual number of summer (tropical) days after this year led to the inversion of the negative trends observed from 1987 to 1992 into positive ones. The increasing trend is statistically significance at 0.01 level in Yumurtalık, Mersin and Antakya for the annual number of summer and tropical days. Dörtyol, İskenderun and Elbistan were significance at 0.01 level for tropical days. The largest positive anomalies of the summer of 2010 are observed in coastal vicinity (Mersin, Yumurtalık and İskenderun). This indicates that these settlements underwent a long-term warm period and thermal conditions due to increasing temperatures in the spring and summer months. The same conditions are found in high inner areas (Göksun and Elbistan) for tropical days. It is noticed that a tendency for greater warming occurred at stations located above 1000m in the sub-region. The average number of warm days will increase 2-days per 100-years in southern part of the sub-region. The increasing trend in summer temperatures can be considered a potential risk, notably for human health and for economic and crop losses in the Adana Sub-region, including Çukurova, one of the most important agriculture areas of Turkey.","Mann-Kendall test,Extreme temperature,Seasonal variation,Climatic change,Eastern Mediterranean,"

Indeed, the results show that there was a sharp decrease both in rainfall amounts and in the number of rainy days during the 60s and the 70s.

"harmful algal bloom forecast system for sw ireland. part ii: are operational oceanographic models useful in a hab warning system","2016","This study investigated the application of a three-dimensional physical hydrodynamic model in a harmful algal bloom forecast system for Bantry Bay, southwest Ireland. Modelled oceanographic conditions were studied and used to help understand observed changes in the chemical and biological patterns from the national biotoxins and phytoplankton monitoring program. The study focused on two toxic events in 2013. An upwelling event was predicted by the model prior to the appearance and population increase of potentially toxic diatoms, Pseudo-nitzschia, and associated domoic acid in shellfish. A downwelling episode was provided as a forecast in the model prior to the arrival of a Dinophysis bloom and detection of its associated biotoxins in Bay shellfish. The modelled forecast products developed included expected surface, mid-depth and bottom current pathways at the mouth of the Bay and on the adjacent shelf. The rate and direction of water volume flow at the mouth and mid-bay sections were produced by the model to examine predicted upwelling and downwelling pulses. The model also calculated the evolution of water properties (temperature, salinity and density) with depth along the Bay axis and on the adjacent continental shelf. Direct measurements of water properties at a fixed point, mid-bay, were comparable to model calculations. The operational model for southwest Ireland produces a reliable 3-day physical hydrodynamic forecast of the dominant regional physical processes that result in water exchange events between Bantry Bay and its adjacent shelf. While simulated physical hydrodynamics were provided as a 3-day forecast, the upwelling and downwelling signals from the model, closely linked to toxic HAB episodes, were evident up to 10 days prior to the contamination of shellfish in the Bay.","Modelled products,Ireland,Nowcast/forecast,HAB,"

"ocean heave cancellation for a maritime infrasound sensor","2016","Infrasound is very low frequency airborne acoustic energy in the frequency band of 3.3 mHz to 20 Hz, that is inaudible to human beings. Natural sources of infrasound include earthquakes, meteors, volcanoes, tsunamis, auroras, and ocean swells. Among anthropogenic sources are atmospheric and underground nuclear explosions. Because of their low frequency, infrasound waves experience little attenuation, and can therefore propagate to, and be detectable from, very long distances. Land-based infrasound microbarometer sensors and networks have the capability of detecting these signals. In this paper, we investigate the fielding of microbarometer sensors in the maritime environment, on boats, buoys, or unmanned surface vehicles (USV). A particular problem to be overcome is the effect of ocean heave on sensor performance. Ocean heave induces interfering pressure fluctuations on the sensor which may obscure the infrasound signal of interest. In this paper, an ocean-heave cancellation method is developed and applied to infrasound data collected with a sensor deployed onboard a ship at sea.

Both satellites operate a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system to give continuity to the European SAR program. SAR is a flexible sensor able to fulfil users/applications requirements in terms of resolution and coverage thanks to different operational modes and polarizations. With the in-orbit availability of very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors, the Sentinel-1 satellites have been designed to achieve wide coverage at medium to high resolution. The interferometric wide swath (IWS) mode implemented with the terrain observation with progressive scan (TOPS) technique is the standard acquisition mode over European waters and land masses. IWS in dual-polarization (VV/VH) combination offers 250-km swath at 5 m Ã— 20 m (range Ã— azimuth) spatial resolution.

It is based on the adaptation of the coprime array beamforming concept to the case of SAR systems: two interlaced sequences of pulses are transmitted, with two sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) that are equal to the Nyquist PRF divided by two coprime integer numbers. Each sequence is separately processed via standard SAR processing, and the two final aliased images are combined in a very simple way to cancel aliasing. We call the proposed approach â€œcoprime SARâ€ (CopSAR). Three different implementations are proposed, and the effectiveness of the CopSAR concept is demonstrated by using both simulated and real SAR data. It turns out that the significant data amount reduction and the range swath increase are only paid with a reduction of the target-to-background ratio and with the presence of a (nonstringent) limit on ship azimuth size.","range swath,standard SAR processing,Antennas,coprime array beamforming concept,ship detection,CopSAR target-to-background ratio,SAR systems,Marine vehicles,coprime synthetic aperture radar,sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies,Synthetic aperture radar,ocean monitoring,SAR technique,Standards,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),geometric resolution loss,CopSAR concept,maritime applications,SAR acquisition mode,Azimuth,Sensors,ship azimuth size,Coprime sampling,remote sensing by radar,Arrays,oceanographic techniques,"
"brainstem calcification in möbius syndrome","2004","Möbius syndrome is characterized by congenital facial diplegia, and may be associated with limb or orofacial malformations. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis, including prenatal ischemia. We identified seven children with Möbius syndrome over the 10-year interval 1992-2001, all of whom manifested incomplete bilateral facial palsy. Associated limb and orofacial anomalies were observed in six cases. Computed tomographic scans were available in six children, and five of them manifested brainstem calcification which was most prominent in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The calcification was detected as early as 7 days of age and did not change with time, suggesting a static condition of prenatal onset. These observations support the hypothesis that the pathology in Möbius syndrome is secondary to prenatal brain ischemia.",""
"regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge in ireland combining medium resolution satellite imagery and geochemical tracing techniques","2012","This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM+ TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of 222Rn (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.","Radon,Landsat ETM+,Submarine groundwater discharge,Salinity,Thermal remote sensing,Geochemical tracing,"
"real-time maritime situation awareness based on deep learning with dynamic anchors","2018","Situation awareness in maritime environment entails early detection and classification of maritime targets of varying sizes, depths, shapes, textures, and contrasts. Thus, this paper describes a novel deep learning based maritime situation awareness approach using high-definition video. Maritime object detection is achieved in three main steps. At first, a key region based tracking algorithm allows to, dynamically and parsimoniously, extract high-quality region proposals mainly focalized around rigid (i.e.; potential object) video locations. The latter are, further, fed into a Fast-RCNN for carrying out objectness detection and box regression. Finally, a mere box post-regression operation enables to extract maritime objects. Furthermore, the found object detections are fed into a second classification RCNN, specifically, trained to recognize up to 40 vessel classes. Our experiments have shown that the proposed approach achieves state of the art speed and accuracy.","real-time maritime situation awareness,object detections,objectness detection,maritime situation awareness approach,high-definition video,key region based tracking algorithm,maritime objects,Streaming media,maritime object detection,regression analysis,Object recognition,neural nets,target tracking,deep learning,object tracking,marine engineering,Proposals,object detection,maritime targets,box post-regression operation,classification RCNN,video signal processing,maritime environment,Deep learning,Object detection,high-quality region proposals,Surveillance,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),dynamic anchors,"
"treat noise as domain shift: noise feature disentanglement for underwater perception and maritime surveys in side-scan sonar images","2023","In underwater perception and maritime surveys, due to the scarcity of training data and perturbation of speckle noise, the detection performance of underwater objects in side-scan sonar (SSS) images is limited. To address these problems, we proposed a noise feature disentanglement YOLO (NFD-YOLO) by combining noise-agnostic features learning and attention mechanism. Firstly, we rethink the speckle noise by treating it as the domain shift between the training dataset and real-measured SSS images and build a domain generalization-based (DG-based) underwater object detection framework. Then, we extend YOLOv5 with a feature manipulation module, a noise-agnostic subnetwork, and an auxiliary noise-biased subnetwork for noise features disentanglement, more biases toward noise-agnostic features and less reliance on noise-biased features in underwater object detection, respectively. Finally, the ACmix attention module is introduced for a more powerful learning capacity and attention to the object areas based on a small dataset. According to the experiment results, the proposed NFD-YOLO achieved 75.1% mean average precision (mAP) in the test domain, which increased by 7.5% than YOLOv5, and 75.7% Â± 0.4% mAP and 77.5% Â± 1.6% mAP for different speckle noise distributions and transfer directions, respectively, which verified its generalization ability and robustness for speckle noise. Therefore, the proposed method can mitigate the effects of speckle noise and provides a new thought to address the speckle noise in underwater object detection with a small dataset, which is of significance and benefits for underwater perception and maritime surveys.","Training,Sonar,Detectors,speckle noise,Feature extraction,Sonar detection,underwater object detection,feature disentanglement,side-scan sonar,attention mechanism,Reverberation,domain generalization,Speckle,"

"twelve years of geophysical research in the charlevoix seismic zone","1988","Various and extensive geophysical monitoring began in 1974 in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ). The historical record and a major earthquake in 1925 characterize this zone as the likely site of a future damaging earthquake (i.e. M = 5.5 or larger) and the aim of the monitoring was to develop the capability of predicting such earthquakes. The parameters studied included: microseismicity, seismic travel times, electrical impedance, vertical movement, horizontal movement, tilt, gravity change, and strain through water well level changes. Although no clear precursor was detected in the months before the largest seismic event that occurred during the observation period (M = 5.0), the multiparameter experiment provided new insights into the structure and the mechanics of this active region. Observations of several hundred well-located microearthquakes have permitted the delineation of ancient rift faults that are now being activated by high horizontal compression. The geographical extent of the zone is sharply defined by the microseismicity which occurs in an area of 35 km × 80 km straddling the St. Lawrence River. Observation of P-waves from accurately-timed explosions and S-waves from earthquakes support the hypothesis of Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy (EDA) involving saturated parallel cracks in the crust. The data have permitted an estimate of both crack density and the direction for the principal compressive stress in the region (N 30° E). Changes in electrical parameters with periods of months to years were detected at five of the six magnetotelluric stations installed in the region. Changes in the polarization angle of the earth's electrical (telluric) field correlated well (for seven years) with calculated groundwater accumulation levels at one site. Electric impedance changes showed no clear correlation from station to station, but changes at one station appear to correlate with a seismic P-wave travel time change anomaly and with the disappearance of a negative gravity anomaly at the time of an unusual number of earthquakes in the range M = 2 to 3 from mid 1976 to mid 1977. It is suggested that these correlated changes could be related to aseismic stress redistribution and fluid flow along one of the NE striking rift faults about two years before theM = 5.0 earthquake in 1979. Continuous monitoring of tilt (surface and borehole) and well-water levels was carried out at a single site (Charlevoix Geophysical Observatory). Although there were unexplained near-surface tilts of the order of the earth tide amplitude within two or three days before some earthquakes, they were either not spatially coherent or were related to small unexplained temperature changes in the tiltmeter vault. No intermediate-term (one week to one year) precursors were seen against a noise level of 1–3 μrad (RMS) for near-surface tilt observations and a noise level of 0.2–0.3 μrad (RMS) for borehole tilt measurements at a depth of 50–100 m. The threshold of detectable tidal tilt admittance changes for the borehole tiltmeters was lowered to 2% but no significant changes were seen. Four coseismic changes in the levels of water in boreholes were observed (all were drops in water level) which were much larger than expected on the basis of elastic dislocation theory. It is suggested that these could be explained either by the collapse of a dilatant zone around the respective hypocentres or by triggered aseisnuc movement on a nearby active fault. Borehole water level tides observed from 1980 to 1986 exhibit significant variations in amplitude and phase which are thought to be the result of time-varying elastic properties in a nearby structure. Some constraints can now be placed on the long-term deformation of the CSZ as a whole from tiltmeter, levelling and horizontal surveys. Data from a levelling array observed from 1976 to 1986 puts a limit of 0.54 μ rad/yr on the secular tilt rate at the observatory: a further limit of 0.1 μ rad/yr is provided by borehole tilt measurements over the period 1983–1986. A limit of 2 cm is placed on vertical movements northwest of the St. Lawrence River by levelling surveys in 1965, 1978, 1980 and 1982. No significant (90% confidence) deviatoric strain has been detected across the CSZ from horizontal control surveys carried out in 1912–1919, 1965, 1978 and 1983: the maximum allowable long-term strain rate across the CSZ from 1919 to 1983 is 0.16 μ strain/yr.",""

"a novel vectorization tracking algorithm for maritime emission monitoring assisted with e-nose enabled unmanned aerial vehicle","2020","Monitoring the gas emission of maritime vessels is very challenging as the fields are almost inaccessible and the dispersion is very susceptible to the surrounding environment. In ultra-large-scale maritime scenes, general emission detection and tracking frameworks based on infotaxis will most likely fall into local turbulence traps. In this work, a novel vectorization tracking algorithm assisted with E-nose enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed for efficient monitoring the vessel emission. Firstly, a new prediction model using AIS data is developed to estimate globally vessel emission. Then, real-time measurements by the onboard E-nose are fused with the emission prediction in the vectorization framework. Based on the proposed tracking algorithm, the UAVâ€™s flight velocity and heading can be adjusted towards the vessel emissions accurately and efficiently. Another contribution of the paper is that a series of real-world maritime experiments with a developed were carried out in order to evaluate the algorithm. The acquired results indicated that the proposed tracking algorithm and the developed E-nose enabled UAV are very efficient for such a maritime environment.","Unmanned aerial vehicles,vectorization tracking,UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle),e-nose,vessel emission,Prediction algorithms,Gas detectors,Dispersion,Robot sensing systems,Monitoring,maritime monitoring,"
"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"weather-aware object detection method for maritime surveillance systems","2023","The development of machine learning-based maritime object detection technology aims to assist ship operators in maritime surveillance. However, as maritime environments can be quite complex, developing object detection models that can handle these situations is a challenging research problem, particularly when dealing with adverse weather conditions like rain and haze. While prior research has attempted to remove weather noise and improve object detection models under various weather conditions, they are limited by computing resources and hard to adapt to the constantly changing weather conditions of maritime environments. Preventing performance degradation as weather conditions shift is a significant challenge in maritime surveillance systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a weather-aware object detection method, Weather-OD, that employs an on-board edge and on-shore cloud-based system for maritime surveillance. It employs specialized machine learning models for object detection, which can be dynamically selected based on the weather conditions to ensure highly accurate object detection with low latency at sea. Weather-OD continuously improves accuracy by periodically training the models with newly collected datasets during voyages, and efficiently manages the life cycle of multiple object detection models, taking into account the constraints of limited edge computing resources. In addition, Weather-OD uses synthetic image data with weather noise to supplement the training data under different weather conditions. We conducted an evaluation of our weather-aware object detection models using a maritime benchmark dataset, the Singapore Maritime Dataset. Our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of our mechanism with weather classification and a significant improvement in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of maritime object detection in rainy and hazy conditions. Additionally, our approach enables the continuous improvement of object detection accuracy through model retraining with small datasets.","Edge cloud,Maritime surveillance,Weather-aware,Object detection,Adaptation,Model specialization,"
"the selective extraction of pb and zn in selected mineral and soil samples, application in geochemical exploration (portugal)","1986","The study described herein concerns the application of selective chemical extractions on metal-bearing minerals and soils to geochemical exploration. Specifically, the study addresses itself to the detection of anomalous soils in the vicinity of a mineralized zone. A kinetic study of selectivity of partial chemical extractions-applied to minerals of Pb and Zn was undertaken in order to establish a systematic procedure (reagents, time of extraction, etc.) which could be recommended for the soils of the study area in Portugal. It is shown that: (1) NH4 acetate dissolves smithsonite, willemite, cerussite, anglesite, pyromorphite completely and coronadite, galena, sphalerite only partially; (2) hydroxylamine hydrochloride dissolves coronadite only partially; (3) H2O2 dissolves sphalerite and galena only partially; (4) hot mixed acids dissolve residual galena, sphalerite and coronadite. About 850 soil and gossan samples were collected from two mineralized districts in Portugal, one in a carbonate environment (Portel) and the other in an aluminosilicate zone (Sanguinheiro). For the kinetic study in soil samples from Portel and Sanguinheiro zones, the minus 80 mesh fraction (−180 μm) was submitted to an extraction procedure using the following reagents, in sequence: NH4 acetate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, NH4 oxalate in darkness, NH4 oxalate under U.V. irradiation and finally strong acids. The mineralogy of the soils from the two areas is different. In the aluminosilicate zone, the products of weathering of sulphide mineralization are mainly anglesite, plumbogummite, amorphous iron oxides, goethite and hematite rich in Pb and Zn. In the carbonate area, the Pb- and Zn-bearing phases generally found in the soil and gossan are Mn oxides, lepidocrocite and hematite. The gossan, in this case, also contains smithsonite and cerussite. In soils from the aluminosilicate zone the use of NH4 oxalate (dark) given a better geochemical response for Pb than NH4 acetate, NH4 oxalate (U.V.) and conventional acid digestion. On the other hand, NH4 oxalate (U.V.) gives better results for Pb and Zn than conventional acid digestion in samples from carbonate area.

"comparison of detectability of ship wake components between c-band and x-band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","2023","The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","Ship wake detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Maritime object detection,Detectability modelling,Machine learning,"
"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"

"galernas: a history of coastally trapped disturbances (2003−2020) with hidden frontogenesis in the bay of biscay","2023","Galerna is the term accepted for an abrupt westerly change that affects the north coast of Spain. The wind surge travels from the mid-north coast of Spain to France, generally reaching their maximum intensity at the Basque Coast, and cuts off a period of hot weather, clear skies, and calm conditions at sea. The galernas have a large history of shipwrecks and fishermen deaths. They have been characterized as coastally trapped disturbances (CTD) and their propagation, enhanced with the local formation of a micro-front, was documented to behave like a density current. Alternatively, synoptic fronts have also been reported to cause galernas, considered to be more intense than those generated by a local micro-front. In this article we have generated the first climatology (2003–2020) of these events based on an objective identification methodology. The developed Event Identification Software (EIS), based on both 10-min surface station data and hourly ERA5 reanalysis fields, together with a new Front Identification Scheme (FIS) have enabled a deeper study into the origin and development of these micro-fronts, and a more comprehensive exploration of the interaction of the oceanic fronts entering the Bay of Biscay. Our results show that the area receives an average of four to five relatively intense galernas (Vmax > 50 km h−1) per year. Their number shows a great interannual variability (from one to seven) and a marked seasonality: May and June concentrate the largest fraction (almost one episode each year) and practically no episodes in winter. They occur more frequently between noon and the late afternoon, where the most intense wind records concentrate. Very strong galernas (Vmax > 72 km h−1) have occurred in all 18 years, can happen in any month from February to November, and their monthly distribution does not show the mentioned seasonality. On the contrary, the highest rates of temperature decrease across the galerna front in the coastal stations (−∆T/0.5 h > 4 °C) do have a stronger seasonality, with May and June concentrating a relatively large number of cases with a more abrupt temperature drop. The FIS shows that most of the galernas (83.5%) have a local origin inside the Bay of Biscay, and only a few ones (16.5%) are caused by oceanic fronts initiated out of the region. The local frontogenesis is more frequently initiated by the relatively cold marine southwesterly pre-frontals preceding a parent oceanic front and blowing against the warm continentals inside the Bay of Biscay, after being ducted along the north and northwestern coast of Spain. This hidden local frontogenesis, first revealed by the FIS, seems to be enhanced by the observed lee troughing, which could have both a thermal and dynamic origin, acting simultaneously after the intense Foehn at the coastal strip, preceding the formation of the galerna front. The local front enhancement appears to be the reason for the apparent jump of the primary front, which may eventually weaken, and even disappear, as the galerna front sharpens. Even during the more occasional frontal galernas, directly caused by the westerlies or north-westerlies behind the oceanic front, their eastward propagation is more rapid over the coastal area. The front deforms in shape and may cause its characteristic unexpected/abrupt irruption. All the EIS detected galernas, even the frontal ones, are wind reversals caused by a coastally trapped marine boundary layer. The upper-level ridge over Europe, observed in all of them, seems to be a synoptic ingredient for their development, preventing the eastward propagation of Atlantic depressions and enhancing at the same time the temperature and pressure gradients between the marine and continental air masses.","Bay of Biscay,Galerna,Frontogenesis,Mesofront,Coastally trapped disturbances,"
"data mining approach to shipping route characterization and anomaly detection based on ais data","2020","A data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection. The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines. Finally, an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided.","Traffic characterization,Maritime traffic,Anomaly detection,Data mining,AIS data,"
"accelerated change in the glaciated environments of western canada revealed through trend analysis of optical satellite imagery","2022","The retreat of mountain glaciers affects mountain hazards and hydrology, and new methods are needed to rapidly map glacier retreat at planetary scales. We automatically map 14,329 glaciers (30,063 km2) in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, from 1984 to 2020 using satellite image archives from the Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 missions and reveal an acceleration in area loss that commenced in 2011. Glacier fragmentation, disappearance, and proglacial lake development also accelerated, as did the retreat of glaciers to higher elevations. Our annually-resolved method relies on the existence of previously published and manually validated glacier inventories from the mid-1980s and mid-2000's. Our methods performed well for clean ice glaciers, had occasional errors when proglacial lakes were present, and consistently underestimated the area of debris-covered glaciers. Clean ice glacier area loss accelerated sevenfold between the early [1984–2010] and late [2011−2020] epochs. This acceleration yielded rates of area shrinkage of −49 ± 7 km2 a−1 [early] and − 340 ± 40 km2 a−1 [late] with accelerated losses (32-fold increase) for small glaciers on Vancouver Island over the last decade. Glacier fragmentation accelerated from 26 ± 5.6 fragments a−1 to 88 ± 39 fragments a−1. About 1141 glaciers fell below our 0.05 km2 detection limit and so disappeared from our database, representing a loss of 8%. Proglacial lake area growth accelerated from 9.2 ± 1.1 km2 a−1 to 49 ± 4.5 km2 a−1.

"propulsion monitoring system for digitized ship management: preliminary results from a case study","2020","The paradigm of Industry 4.0 a fundamental driver of innovation in marine industry, where the new digital era will see the development of smart cyber-ships equipped with advanced automation systems that will progressively evolve towards fully autonomous vessels. Although the journey towards such technological frontier has started, most companies operating in the maritime sector still appear un-prepared to face the future scenario. In the maritime sector, in fact, empirical models and oversimplified approaches are still largely employed for the management of fleet operations. There is thus the necessity of developing and providing operative models for digitized ship management, which, based on structured information gathering and processing, can provide maritime companies with effective decision support systems in order to strengthen their value chain. This paper focuses on the context of the monitoring of the propulsion system, which is one of the most important systems of a ship and a main source of operation and support costs. A decision support system is presented involving automated data gathering and analysis procedures, to assess the correct functioning of the system and for early-detection of incipient failures. The methodology has been validated through a real case study, and the related results are discussed.","Continuous engine monitoring system,smart ship,industry 4.0,"
"red tide detection based on high spatial resolution broad band optical satellite data","2022","Red tide, one of the major ecological disasters in the world, exerts great impact on the marine environment. The ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution is often used for red tide detection, but is insufficient for the fine-scale red tide detection due to its coarse spatial resolution. To address this problem, a new red tide detection method based on pseudo hue angle (PHA-RI) for high spatial resolution broad band satellite data is proposed in this paper. Different from the standard International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system, the false-color bands of near infrared (NIR), red and green are used to calculate the CIE tristimulus X, Y, Z, instead of the true-color bands of red, green and blue. With this method, the red tide can be easily differentiated from non-red tide water, and the distinction between red tide and non-red tide water is doubled compared to that of true-color bands composite. Experiment results show that the PHA-RI method can effectively detect red tide, with an averaged overall accuracy, F1-score and precision of 92%, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively. Compared with the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM) and spectral index algorithm Gaofen-1 (GF-1) red tide detection index (GF-RI), the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages in red tide detection, especially for the strip distributed red tide. Besides, the proposed algorithm has good applicability, and it is proved to be suitable for the detection of red tides with different dominant species including Noctiluca scintillans, Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiide. Also, it is applicable to different broad band sensors, such as Chinese satellites GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV), Haiyang 1D (HY-1D) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The application experiment indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in red tide detection, and it can successfully detect fine-scale red tide events, which have not been detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua due to its coarse spatial resolution. The results also shows the advantages of high spatial resolution satellites in fine-scale red tide detection. This work provides a method for red tide detection using high spatial resolution broad band satellite data.","Pseudo hue angle,Detection method,Red tide,Remote sensing,Broad band sensor,"

"a detailed study of the distribution of heat flow and radioactivity in new hampshire (u.s.a.)","1982","We present a set of 39 new determinations of heat flow and radiogenic heat production for several different geological environments in the State of New Hampshire (U.S.A.). With the extensive data set now available for the state, the linear relation of heat flow and heat production appears as a very useful generalization for the study of the heat flow field of a geological province. Our measurements indicate that the vertical distribution of radiogenic heat production is similar in plutonic and metasedimentary rocks. Our data are compatible with the linear relationship established earlier by F. Birch and his co-workers in 1968. Young granites are markedly enriched in radioactive elements and those which do not outcrop are revealed by anomalies in the general relation of heat flow versus radioactivity. Heat flow is high for plutons by low elsewhere. The mean heat flow through metasedimentary formations is 1.15 μcal/cm2 s (48 mW/m2), a value near the mean heat flow for old cratons. The lowest heat flow measured is 0.76 μcal/cm2 s (32 mW/m2) for a unit poor in radioactivity. The heat flow field grades smoothly into the low heat flow regions of the Canadian Shield. The New Hampshire region is in thermal equilibrium: its heat flow is in secular equilibrium with the heat generated by crustal sources and that supplied from the mantle. In this area, the thermal perturbations due to orogenic events decrease below the detection level in less than 200–275 Ma. The thickness of the layer which is thermally affected during continent-continent collision-type orogenies cannot be greater than about 190 km.",""
"maritime moving target detection with space-based passive radar based on multi-frame modified wigner-ville distribution","2018","This study focuses on maritime moving target detection with space-based passive radar. It is hard to detect maritime moving target due to the low radar cross section (RCS) and low target's energy. Particularly, when target moves far away from the receiver, it is normally submerged by strong noise. To solve the problem, a maritime moving target detection method based on multi-frame modified wigner-ville distribution (M-WVD) is proposed. Keystone transform is first applied to concentrate the energy of moving target into one range cell. For further energy accumulation, M- WVD based multiple frames method and non-coherent integration technique is used.

"ldsn: localization scheme for double-head maritime sensor networks","2014","Ocean covers nearly 71% of our planet's surface, yet 95% of the ocean remains unexplored by human being, and wireless sensor networks are envisioned to perform monitoring tasks over the large portion of our world. However, deploying wireless sensor networks on the sea poses many challenges and for maritime surveillance security applications we may need to deploy sensors both on the sea surface and underwater for three-dimensional detection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid ocean sensor networks called Double-head maritime Sensor Networks (DSNs), which combine the advantages of wireless sensor networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. By leveraging the unique characteristics of DSNs, we design a localization scheme LDSN which is consisted of two algorithms SML and FLA. We first use SML to localize moored anchor nodes as seed nodes.

Among them, acoustical measurement methods are the most widely used in practical applications. Hence, some typical acoustical measurement methods are introduced with more details, from their principles to application examples. Electrical and electromagnetic methods are also widely adopted and more traditional methods in geological exploration and subsurface structure detection are described. Several routine approaches and their applications are exhibited, too. While, in practical applications, how to sense the “waves” in rugged measurement environment is another important issue. Due to the presence of many extra benefits in “waves” sensing compared to traditional methods, optical sensing techniques are summarized and introduced with their application examples. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technology for detecting, locating, and inspecting objects or structures buried underneath ground surface. It is also applicable to detect objects behind walls or other dielectric barriers. In this chapter, the operating mechanism of GPR is explained.

"a stacking ensemble of deep learning models for iot intrusion detection","2023","The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has increased considerably in the past few years, which resulted in an exponential growth of cyber attacks on IoT infrastructure. As a consequence, the prompt detection of attacks in IoT environments through the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has become essential.

This approach is named Deep Integrated Stacking for the IoT (DIS-IoT) and it combines four different DL models into a fully connected DL layer, creating a standalone ensemble model. DIS-IoT is evaluated on three open-source datasets, namely ToN_IoT, CICIDS2017 and SWaT, in binary and multi-class classification and compared results with other standard DL methods. Experiments demonstrate that DIS-IoT is capable of a high-level accuracy with a very low False Positive rate (FPR) in all datasets. Results were also compared against other state-of-the-art works available in the literature, which used similar methods on the same ToN_IoT dataset.

"diamond exploration from the bottom up: regional geophysical signatures of lithosphere conditions favorable for diamond exploration","1995","On a local scale, regional geophysical trends may be used to locate the sites of volcanism which transports diamonds to the surface. By studying the conditions under which carbon is stable as diamond, a new regional geophysical exploration philosophy is espoused based upon the search for lithospheric conditions favorable to diamond genesis and preservation. Surface heat flow values of less than 40–45 mW m−2 and lithospheric thicknesses of greater than 150 km meet these target conditions. An analysis of two-dimensional thermal heterogeneities in the lithosphere indicates that target areas should have low surface heat flow over an areas of at least 300 to 400 km diameter. In addition to having low surface heat flow, such target regions are likely to be characterized by a large depth to the Curie Point isotherm, relatively great depths to lithospheric electrical conductors, slow seismic velocities, and great depths to the seismic low velocity zone. The region is likely to be characterized by a paucity of seismicity with high maximum hypocentral depths. The primary problem with these techniques in regional diamond exploration is that they provide information about modern lithospheric structure. Changes in lithospheric structure through time may be detected as elevation changes. These conditions are most commonly found in regions of Archean and Early Proterozoic lithosphere, and are consistent with Clifford's Rule, an empirical diamond exploration strategy. The restriction of these conditions to these ancient terrains may be associated with special conditions required to form these terrains which only existed early in Earth history, or with an increase in the thermal heterogeneity of the lithosphere through time which results in, on average, thinner lithosphere in younger terrains.",""

"chapter 55 - arginine and citrulline as nutraceuticals: efficacy and safety in diseases","2021","L-citrulline and L-arginine are naturally occurring amino acids that are conditionally essential in periods of stress (sepsis, intestinal pathology). Previously considered to be only intermediates in the urea acid cycle, they are now found to be effective precursors of nitric oxide that are exploited in therapeutics. Its their supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like such as erectile dysfunction, male infertility, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hyperoxic lung damage, uric acid cycle disorders, and intrauterine growth restriction. Other emerging uses are include immunonutrition, immunomodulation, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer’s disease, multiinfarct dementia, T-cell dysfunction, as an antioxidant in conditions like sepsis, and for athletic training. Overall, citrulline (Cit) is a more effective precursor of arginine than arginine itself. Its role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis is of considerable interest. These nutraceuticals should be further explored in large-scale clinical trials in these areas. Another area of interest regarding Cit is the detection of an antibody to citrullinated peptides that serve as predictors for diseases, thus serving as biomarkers in various diseases. Cit has been used as a biomarker for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, intestinal pathology, and short bowel syndrome short bowel syndrome as biomarkers. It will either be proved or disproved as a biomarker in the future for other conditions such as parenteral nutrition in HIV patients, congenital anomalies, acute rejections in transplantations, intrauterine growth restriction, critically ill patients, acute kidney failure, and nitrosative stress (NO/NOS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in conditions such as anticholinesterase poisoning and, kainic acid-induced neurotoxicity because oxidative stress increases RNS and reactive oxygen species reactive oxygen species (when the rate of adenosine triphosphate demand exceeds production), causing lipid peroxidation and DNA damage.

"induction machine bearing faults detection based on a multi-dimensional music algorithm and maximum likelihood estimation","2016","Condition monitoring of electric drives is of paramount importance since it contributes to enhance the system reliability and availability. Moreover, the knowledge about the fault mode behavior is extremely important in order to improve system protection and fault-tolerant control. Fault detection and diagnosis in squirrel cage induction machines based on motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has been widely investigated. Several high resolution spectral estimation techniques have been developed and used to detect induction machine abnormal operating conditions. This paper focuses on the application of MCSA for the detection of abnormal mechanical conditions that may lead to induction machines failure. In fact, this paper is devoted to the detection of single-point defects in bearings based on parametric spectral estimation. A multi-dimensional MUSIC (MD MUSIC) algorithm has been developed for bearing faults detection based on bearing faults characteristic frequencies. This method has been used to estimate the fundamental frequency and the fault related frequency. Then, an amplitude estimator of the fault characteristic frequencies has been proposed and fault indicator has been derived for fault severity measurement. The proposed bearing faults detection approach is assessed using simulated stator currents data, issued from a coupled electromagnetic circuits approach for air-gap eccentricity emulating bearing faults.

"spectral anomaly methods for aerial detection using kut nuisance rejection","2015","This work discusses the application and optimization of a spectral anomaly method for the real-time detection of gamma radiation sources from an aerial helicopter platform. Aerial detection presents several key challenges over ground-based detection. For one, larger and more rapid background fluctuations are typical due to higher speeds, larger field of view, and geographically induced background changes. As well, the possible large altitude or stand-off distance variations cause significant steps in background count rate as well as spectral changes due to increased gamma-ray scatter with detection at higher altitudes. The work here details the adaptation and optimization of the PNNL-developed algorithm Nuisance-Rejecting Spectral Comparison Ratios for Anomaly Detection (NSCRAD), a spectral anomaly method previously developed for ground-based applications, for an aerial platform. The algorithm has been optimized for two multi-detector systems; a NaI(Tl)-detector-based system and a CsI detector array. The optimization here details the adaptation of the spectral windows for a particular set of target sources to aerial detection and the tailoring for the specific detectors. As well, the methodology and results for background rejection methods optimized for the aerial gamma-ray detection using Potassium, Uranium and Thorium (KUT) nuisance rejection are shown. Results indicate that use of a realistic KUT nuisance rejection may eliminate metric rises due to background magnitude and spectral steps encountered in aerial detection due to altitude changes and geographically induced steps such as at land–water interfaces.","Aerial detection,Radiation detection,KUT nuisance rejection,Spectral anomaly detection,Aerial search,"

Females with imposex were present at all sampling sites with highest levels inside main harbors. Imposex parameters across sampling stations varied between 6.3% and 100% for %I, 0.2–4.4 for VDSI, 0.1–7.8mm for FPL, 0.3–88.9% for RPLI and 0.0–1.1 for AOS. TBT levels varied between 3.5 and 380ngSng−1 dw, representing an average proportion of 50.4% of total butyltins (∑BTs=MBT+DBT+TBT). Sterile females were detected at two locations. Highly significant correlations between imposex and TBT levels were found. The efficacy of the EU legislation banning the use of TBT-based antifouling paints since 2003 (EC Regulation 782/2003) was evaluated by comparing the levels of imposex observed in 2008 with those reported for 2003. OTs tissue concentrations were also determined in preserved samples collected in 2003. There was a decrease in imposex and TBT tissue contamination between 2003 and 2008 indicating that a decline in TBT pollution has occurred in the Portuguese coast since the implementation of the legislation. Considering that the EC Regulation 782/2003 is an anticipation of the IMO AFS Convention, a global scale decrease in TBT pollution can be expected in the near future. Despite the rapid amelioration in the Portuguese coast, TBT pollution is still a problem as the Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) proposed by OSPAR Commission was not achieved in 91% of the surveyed sites.","Portuguese coast,EC Regulation 782/2003,Sterility,Tributyltin,"

"coral reef applications of sentinel-2: coverage, characteristics, bathymetry and benthic mapping with comparison to landsat 8","2018","The Sentinel-2A and 2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers a specification of potential value toward a number of objectives in remote sensing of coral reefs. Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10 m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available. First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored. Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales. Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2's greatest strengths.","Bathymetry,Landsat,Sentinel-2,Coral reefs,Habitat mapping,Sun glint,"

"butyltin in ballast water of merchant ships","2007","The time series of analyzed values indicated that concentration of butyltin (BT) compounds in ballast water varied widely depending on the tanks, depths, and dates of sampling, ranging 4–93ngl−1 during 7-day voyage. Variations in concentrations of BT in the two ballast tanks corresponded well with the level of BT contamination in different pumping sites of ballast waters. Concentrations of BT species detected in ballast water were rather consistent with those found in port waters and sediment of Taiwan and Japan. This study suggested that the problems concerning BT contamination were neither static nor localized.","Butyltin compounds,Ballast water,Tributyltin,Ships,Marine coating,TBT,"

"botnet detection based on traffic behavior analysis and flow intervals","2013","Botnets represent one of the most serious cybersecurity threats faced by organizations today. Botnets have been used as the main vector in carrying many cyber crimes reported in the recent news. While a significant amount of research has been accomplished on botnet analysis and detection, several challenges remain unaddressed, such as the ability to design detectors which can cope with new forms of botnets. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect botnet activity based on traffic behavior analysis by classifying network traffic behavior using machine learning. Traffic behavior analysis methods do not depend on the packets payload, which means that they can work with encrypted network communication protocols. Network traffic information can usually be easily retrieved from various network devices without affecting significantly network performance or service availability. We study the feasibility of detecting botnet activity without having seen a complete network flow by classifying behavior based on time intervals. Using existing datasets, we show experimentally that it is possible to identify the presence of existing and unknown botnets activity with high accuracy even with very small time windows.","Intrusion detection,Botnet,Network flows,Traffic behavior analysis,Machine learning,"

"detection of rain-on-snow (ros) events and ice layer formation using passive microwave radiometry: a context for peary caribou habitat in the canadian arctic","2017","Over the past four decades, amplified warming in the Arctic has led to numerous consequences. Of particular relevance, negative anomalies of snow and sea ice cover, glacier retreat, and the extended melt of Greenland combined with increasing temperature at double the rate of the rest of the planet have been observed in the Arctic. Several studies have suggested that another response to the current arctic warming could be an increase in rain-on-snow (ROS) events followed by subsequent freezing and the creation of ice layers. We use recently developed detection algorithms of ROS and ice events using passive microwave retrieval approaches to examine the spatial and temporal trends in rain-on-snow and ice layer creation for 18 islands across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) over the last two decades. Results show that both icing and ROS event occurrence tripled between the periods of 1979–1995 and 1996–2011, with very active years in winters 1993–1994, 1998–1999 and 2002–2003. The areas with the most combined occurrences are the Boothia Peninsula and Axel Heiberg, Cornwallis, Banks and Victoria Islands. We then compare the rain-on-snow and icing events to Peary caribou estimates to test whether the algorithms can detect weather events associated with population declines. There has been an important reduction in population numbers of Peary caribou, the northernmost caribou population in Canada, over the last three generations. The major hypothesis for the decline is that severe weather events lead to more difficult winter grazing conditions. The comparison with the Peary caribou population estimates suggest that caribou numbers decrease with increased occurrence of ROS and icing events, where 3–4 ROS events and 1–2 icing events in one winter season are sufficient to have a negative impact on Peary caribou.","Ice layers,Snow,Peary caribou,Rain-on-snow,Passive microwave,Arctic,"

"infrared small target detection using reinforced mser-induced saliency measure","2023","This paper presents a robust scheme to extract weak small target under intricate backgrounds. Firstly, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) algorithm is employed to seek extremal regions whose size and shape are consistent with the definition of small target and whose gray level is relatively stable. Then, in view of the fact that small targets are relatively sparse defect areas in the whole image, the MSER-induced global saliency measure (MGSM) is developed to reduce regular backgrounds and enhance target signal. Meanwhile, based on the characteristics of small targets with compact gray levels and a certain contrast with its surrounding background, the MSER-induced local saliency measure (MLSM) is designed to reliably enlarge the target signal and remove strong clutter interferences. Finally, the reinforced MSER-induced saliency measure (RMSM) defined by fusing MGSM and MLSM can successfully eliminate complex backgrounds and highlight real targets. Results demonstrate that this method has superiority in enhancing dim target against various backgrounds and has strong robustness to different target shapes and sizes.","Global and local saliency measurements,Infrared imaging,Small target detection,maximally stable extremal regions (MSER),"
"use of the automatic identification system (ais) on autonomous weather buoys for maritime domain awareness applications","2006","The United States Coast Guard (USCG), as part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for a wide variety of missions in the maritime domain. In order to support the accomplishment of these missions, the USCG needs to collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of maritime activity relates to the movement of vessels. Therefore, detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels are a key component of what is known as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a technology that is used primarily as a tool for maritime safety, including vessel collision avoidance and as a means for coastal nations' Vessel Traffic Services (VTSs) to get information on vessels operating near their coasts. AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course, and speed to enhance safety. These transmissions can be received by other vessels or by land-based stations equipped with AIS receivers. The USCG sees the capability AIS provides, particularly for vessel tracking, as a major contributor to MDA and VTS. To extend the capability of USCG land-based AIS monitoring stations further offshore, the USCG Maritime Domain Awareness Program Integration Office sponsored the development of a near real-time, autonomous automatic identification and telemetry system based on AIS technology for installation on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather buoys through the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and its technical support contractor, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).","Satellites,prototype system,satellite telemetry,Monitoring,geosynchronous satellite transmission system,Transmitters,satellite transmitter,AD 2005 03 to 2005 06,autonomous weather buoys,Assembly systems,oceanographic equipment,Relays,AIS-equipped vessel detection,Automatic Identification System,Cape Cod,Maritime Domain Awareness applications,MDA,Prototypes,Charleston,Strait of Juan de Fuca,offshore installations,Telemetry,real-time relay,Real time systems,USCG,South Carolina,national security,meteorology,AIS receiver,NDBC Data Assembly Center,NDAC,Massachusetts,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,System testing,Embedded system,San Francisco Harbor,"
"research into vessel behaviour pattern recognition in the maritime domain: past, present and future","2021","A comprehensive literature review on vessel behaviour pattern recognition in maritime and littoral environments, spanning a period of three decades, is presented. A vast majority of research focuses on anomalous vessel behaviour detection from Automated Identification System (AIS) data, using artificial intelligence (AI), Bayesian networks and machine learning based methods. AIS is a cooperative system that employs VHF transceivers to share vessel information through terrestrial and satellite communication networks. To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations. The paper concludes with a discussion of future outlook in vessel behaviour pattern recognition research.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Target tracking,Pattern of life,Anomaly detection,Plan recognition,Bayesian networks,Target classification,"

Existing event-based clustering and feature tracking approaches for surveillance and object detection work well in the majority of cases, but fall short in a maritime environment. Our application of maritime vessel detection and tracking requires a process that can identify features and output a confidence score representing the likelihood that the feature was produced by a vessel, which may trigger a subsequent alert or activate a classification system. However, the maritime environment presents unique challenges such as the tendency of waves to produce the majority of events, demanding the majority of computational processing and producing false positive detections.

"dynamic effective connectivity network based on change points detection","2022","Human brain networks can be modeled as a system of interconnected brain regions which are recorded by time-dependent observations with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the temporal dynamics, it is essential to understand the connections among distinct brain regions, and how these connections evolve over time. However, the change points of dynamic reorganization in brain connectivity are unknown, which may occur frequently during the scanning session. In this paper, we introduce a fused lasso regression approach to detect the number and position of rapid connectivity changes of subject and subsequently estimate the brain effective connectivity networks within each state phase lying between consecutive change points by conditional Granger causality method from fMRI time series data. The performance of the method is verified via numerical simulations and the obtained classification accuracy with support vector machine (SVM) was 86.24% in 140 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Compared with static EC model and conventional dynamic EC model based on sliding window technique, the experimental results show that the fused lasso achieved better classification effect, which probably due to better dynamic description. The result shows that the dynamic effective connectivity based on change points detected by fused lasso method is a better feature for classification.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD),Dynamic brain connectivity,Granger causality analysis,Change points detection,Fused lasso regression,"

"enhanced surveillance of shellfish mortality to improve early detection and investigation of outbreaks of exotic or emerging infectious diseases: an example of a mass mortality outbreak of mussels, france 2014","2016","This paper explores the relevance and feasibility of enhanced surveillance of mussel-related mortality based on regular telephone interviews of a key informant in a farming community. Based on qualitative analyses of data collected through semi-structured interviews, this method of participatory disease surveillance enabled the retrieval of high quality data during an outbreak of mussel mortality which occurred in Pertuis Charentais, France, in 2014. The findings illustrated that such an enhanced surveillance approach compared with the institutional shellfish health surveillance system could improve the early detection of outbreaks of mussel mortality by one week. This approach enabled a detailed description of the outbreak, showing higher incidence proportion in the Northern water bodies. It also captured relevant data for hypothesis generation for further outbreak investigations, integrating a global view of the health and disturbance of the coastal marine ecosystem. However, to be effective and sustainable, this flexible approach requires a pre-existing knowledge of the structure of the information network of the farmers’ community. Such a community-based enhanced surveillance could increase the reactivity of the entire system to enable the earliest possible and most appropriate interventions to protect shellfish populations against exotic or emerging infectious diseases. This would also help to improve the vigilance of mussel farmers and foster their commitment, which is an essential element for sustainable shellfish health surveillance.","Enhanced clinical surveillance,Participative disease surveillance,Early warning,Shellfish diseases,Perception,Qualitative methods,"

"understanding global spatio-temporal trends and the relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors by land cover during 1982–2014","2020","Analysis of the correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variable trends is important in the study of vegetation greenness.

First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas. However, temperatures decreased in the western part of South America, Angola, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Precipitation decreased the most from March to May over most parts of the world with high correlation (r = 0.88) in Russia Canada, northeast Asia, and central Africa.

Using a vector map, 10 points of renewed expansion and nine contact zones, were detected. The whole does not correspond to a process of homogeneous diffusion, approximately steady, but a process marked by phases of geographical expansion and stasis.","Early Neolithic Europe,14C dates,Arrhythmic model,Expansion of early farming,Renewed expansion,Contact zones,Vector map,"
"maritime radar target detection using convolutional neural networks","2022","Maritime airborne surveillance radars operating at medium to high grazing angles experience significant sea clutter returns with a time and range-varying Doppler spectra, thus making the detection of small targets extremely difficult. This has led to the development of new techniques to better isolate targets from the background sea clutter. In this paper, two convolutional neural network approaches are proposed. They include a method of reconstructing maritime point target signals, while rejecting non-homogeneous clutter and a novel approach that is able to directly locate the target signal peak from sea clutter using a convolutional autoencoder trained in a supervised manner. These two approaches may be considered pre-processing stages in a detection scheme, with a simple threshold detection scheme used to detect targets with a desired false alarm rate.","airborne radar,isolate targets,marine radar,radar detection,target detection,radar clutter,simple threshold detection scheme,neural nets,target tracking,background sea clutter,convolutional autoencoder,nonhomogeneous clutter,Training data,maritime airborne surveillance radars,object detection,target signal peak,search radar,maritime point target signals,convolutional neural network,Radar clutter,radar signal processing,Radar sea clutter,Convolution,convolutional neural networks,clutter,Azimuth,Doppler radar,maritime radar target detection,Object detection,learning (artificial intelligence),high grazing angles,significant sea clutter returns,convolutional neural network approaches,Radar detection,"

"robust detection of infrared maritime targets for autonomous navigation","2020","This paper addresses a problem on infrared maritime target detection robustly in various situations. Its main contribution is to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in different backgrounds, for various targets, using multiple infrared wave bands. The accuracy and the computational time of traditional infrared maritime searching systems are improved by our proposed Local Peak Singularity Measurement (LPSM)-Based Image Enhancement and Grayscale Distribution Curve Shift Binarization (GDCSB)-Based Target Segmentation. The first part uses LPSM to quantize the local singularity of each peak. Additionally, an enhancement map (EM) is generated based on the quantitative local singularity. After multiplying the original image by the EM, targets can be enhanced and the background will be suppressed. The second part of GDCSB-Based Target Segmentation calculates the desired threshold by cyclic shift of the grayscale distribution curve (GDC) of the enhanced image. After binarizing the enhanced image, real targets can be segmented from the image background. To verify the proposed algorithm, experiments based on 13,625 infrared maritime images and five comparison algorithms were conducted. Results show that the proposed algorithm has solid performance in strong and weak background clutters, different wave bands, different maritime targets, etc.","image denoising,LPSM,enhancement map,target detection,image background,Feature extraction,multiple infrared wave bands,image enhancement,traditional infrared maritime searching systems,image colour analysis,infrared maritime targets,grayscale distribution curve shift binarization-based target segmentation,marine engineering,quantitative local singularity,robust detection,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,object detection,infrared maritime target detection accuracy,maritime targets,Infrared imaging,maritime images,Image segmentation,correlation methods,clutter,infrared imaging,GDCSB-based target segmentation,Object detection,Surveillance,wave bands,image segmentation,autonomous navigation,local peak singularity measurement-based image enhancement,"

"shell disease in eastern oysters, crassostrea virginica, reared in france","2002","Progeny of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, introduced into France in 1992, were reared in IFREMER facilities to test their growth performances. During the summer of 1993, sporadic mass mortalities (80–90%) occurred among C. virginica spat reared in the IFREMER laboratories in La Tremblade (Charente Maritime, France) and Bouin (Vendée, France). Affected oysters presented mantle retraction and deposition of an anomalous conchiolin layer on the inner surface of the shell. The incidence of oysters with gross signs exceeded 80%. No obvious pathogen was identified in soft tissues by histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, histological examination showed the presence of anomalous basophilic round structures, 0.5–1 μm in diameter, in gill and mantle connective tissues. These extracellular Feulgen-negative structures reacted positively with the von Kossa stain. TEM examination on mantle and gill samples in diseased spat showed that the basophilic bodies consisted of concentric deposits of an amorphous substance interpreted as containing calcium. These observations may indicate that the mineralization process in spat shells was disturbed without exact determination of the cause. Based on the similarities of the gross signs to those reported in juvenile eastern oysters in the United States, we believe that the cause of the mortalities observed in France was probably the Juvenile Oyster Disease. Moreover, we report for the first time the detection of anomalous amorphous structures in gill and mantle connective tissues associated with mortalities and deposition of an anomalous conchioloin layer on the inner shell surface in C. virginica spat.",""
"gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance: long integration time mti technique","2017","The exploitation of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as transmitters of opportunity in passive radar systems for maritime surveillance is particularly attractive because of the main advantages consisting in a global coverage (even in open sea) and in the availability of multiple sources (different satellites and constellations). The main drawback stays in the restricted power budget provided by navigation satellites. This makes necessary to conceive, define and develop innovative moving target detection techniques specifically tailored for the system under consideration, in order to make this technology a powerful tool for persistent surveillance of sea areas of interest. To this aim, a long integration time Maritime Moving Target Indication technique is proposed in this work, and its effectiveness is proved against experimental data involving a small maritime target, not detectable by conventional MTI techniques.

"sar and ais fusion for maritime surveillance","2018","This paper presents a novel approach to fuse Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for maritime surveillance. The procedure consists of four steps. First, ship detection is performed in the SAR image using a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm; then feature extraction (ship position, heading and size) is performed on ships detected in the SAR image, the third step consists in identifying the detected ships and extracting the same features from the AIS data. The final step is to feed the fusion block with both features vectors extracted separately from the SAR and AIS. Here the arithmetic mean function is established. The algorithm is tested using simulated SAR images and AIS data.

"lda-mig detectors for maritime targets in nonhomogeneous sea clutter","2023","This article deals with the problem of detecting maritime targets embedded in nonhomogeneous sea clutter, where the limited number of secondary data is available due to the heterogeneity of sea clutter. A class of linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors is proposed in the supervised scenario. As customary, Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices are used to model the observational sample data, and the clutter covariance matrix of the received dataset is estimated as the geometric mean of the secondary HPD matrices. Given a set of training HPD matrices with class labels, which are elements of a higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold, the LDA manifold projection learns a mapping from the higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold to a lower dimensional one subject to maximum discrimination. In this study, the LDA manifold projection, with the cost function maximizing between-class distance while minimizing within-class distance, is formulated as an optimization problem in the Stiefel manifold. Four robust LDA-MIG detectors corresponding to different geometric measures are proposed. Numerical results based on both simulated radar clutter with interferences and real IPIX radar data show the advantage of the proposed LDA-MIG detectors against their counterparts without using LDA and the state-of-the-art maritime target detection methods in nonhomogeneous sea clutter.","linear discriminant analysis,covariance matrices,geometry,marine radar,secondary HPD matrices,Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) manifold,matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors,radar detection,target detection,radar clutter,Sea measurements,Covariance matrices,simulated radar clutter,Manifolds,Data models,object detection,optimisation,LDA manifold projection,maritime targets,within-class distance,between-class distance,Hermitian positive-definite matrices,matrix information geometry detectors,robust LDA-MIG detectors,clutter,class labels,nonhomogeneous sea clutter,linear discriminant analysis (LDA),Training,higher dimensional HPD matrix manifold,Clutter,observational sample data,clutter covariance matrix,geophysical signal processing,training HPD matrices,learning (artificial intelligence),remote sensing by radar,Detectors,secondary data,oceanographic techniques,"
"data-driven detection and context-based classification of maritime anomalies","2015","Discovering anomalies at sea is one of the critical tasks of Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) activities and an important enabler for maritime security operations. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to anomaly detection, highlighting challenges specific to the maritime domain. This work builds on unsupervised learning techniques which provide models for normal traffic behaviour. A methodology to associate tracks to the derived traffic model is then presented. This is done by the pre-extraction of contextual information as the baseline patterns of life (i.e., routes) in the area under investigation. In addition to a brief description of the approach to derive the routes, their characterization and representation is presented in support of exploitable knowledge to classify anomalies. A hierarchical reasoning is proposed where new tracks are first associated to existing routes based on their positional information only and â€œoff-routeâ€ vesselsâ€ are detected. Then, for on-route vessels further anomalies are detected such as â€œspeed anomalyâ€ or â€œheading anomalyâ€.

"sources of the seasonal-trend behaviour and periodicity modulation of 7be air concentration in the atmospheric surface layer observed in southeastern spain","2019","The components and the periodicity characterising airborne 7Be monthly concentration collected in Granada (SE Spain) between 2000 and 2018 are studied. These 19 years of measurements are particularly significant for the 7Be analysis as they cover the complete 24th solar cycle, 2008–2018. A Time Series Decomposition (TSD) technique has been applied to determine the different components present in the dataset: the trend, seasonal and irregular components. Then, the atmospheric parameters (Precipitation (Pp), Relative Humidity (RH), Temperature (Temp), Wind speed (WS), Total Cloudiness (TC), Low Cloudiness (LC)), teleconnection indices and the solar activity (Sun Spot Number, SSN) were used to justify the variability of each component. SSN and the teleconnection indices (Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO)) are found to have a major impact on the trend component of 7Be. In turn, all the atmospheric parameters were found to have strong impact on the seasonal component. In order to observe the change in the impact of the parameters from the 24th solar cycle (from 2008 to 2018) to the complete time series (starting in 2000), the comparison between the two periods has been carried out. The results show that, over the 24th solar cycle, the SSN impacted predominantly on the trend component, whereas atmospheric parameters showed a slightly higher impact on the seasonal component. In addition, some atmospheric factors (Temp, RH, Pp, TC, LC) appeared to partially affect the irregular component. The analysis of the two phases of the 24th solar cycle shows that the influence of SSN is higher during the descending phase than during the ascending one. This behaviour is opposed to the one found for the 23rd solar cycle, which clarifies the special characteristics of the 24th cycle. Besides that, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis was applied in order to extract the possible periodicities characterising 7Be data. The analysis revealed three sets of periodicities. Then, the Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) method was particularly useful to study coherences between 7Be data and teleconnection indices. The 7Be concentrations in the large period (11–14 years) detected by CWT was found to be mainly modulated by WeMO, AMO and QBO, while the NAO modulates the smaller periods.","Wavelet analysis,Teleconnections indices,Time series decomposition,Atmospheric aerosols,Be,"

"advances in ne-atlantic coastal sea level change monitoring by delay doppler altimetry","2021","A significant part of the World population lives in the coastal zone, which is affected by sea level rise and extreme events. Consistent and precise new measurements are needed to assess and predict these changes. New altimeter missions equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode provide more accurate sea level heights. In this work we analyse their impacts on the estimation of the coastal sea level variability in the last 10 km. First, by analysing various standard and improved SAR altimetric products it is found that SAR altimetry will reduce the minimum usable distance from five to three kilometres. The best performance is achieved with the SAR coastal retrackers SAMOSA+ and SAMOSA++. A comparable performance is obtained in low resolution Reduced SAR (RDSAR) mode with the Spatio-Temporal Altimeter sub-waveform Retracker (STAR). In both cases, sea level heights are recovered with 4 cm accuracy up to 3 km from the coast at the Helgoland station, and the accuracy does not decrease with the distance to coast. In estuaries and coastal zones with hight tidal regimes, the discrepancy between altimetry and in-situ observations remains large (40 cm standard deviation difference (stdd) with SAR-SAM+). CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A have similar accuracy, despite their different repeat cycle and sampling, which require a different post-processing. The monthly coastal variability from the SAR-SAM+ product agrees most favourably with the NEMO-WAM model, with stdd 3.9 and correlation 0.90 for Sentinel-3A. Instead, the maximum departure between altimeter data products is between SAR-SAM+ and RDSAR-TALES CryoSat-2 data (stdd 2.3 and correlation 0.96). An average trend of about 3 ± 1.3 mm/yr has been detected using low resolution altimetry at ninetheen in-situ stations along the German coast over time intervals longer than 15 years. The difference of the trends of altimetry and tide gauge co-located time-series (al-tg) agrees with the GNSS rates within 1.5 mm/yr at half of the co-located locations, with error of al-tg larger than the error of the GPS rate by a factor bigger than two. The larger departure between monthly tide gauge and LRM altimetric time-series as between tide gauge and SAR altimetric time-series confirms the higher accuracy of SAR data compared to LRM. Finally, the sea level trends of the merged LRM and SAR altimetry time-series are consistent with the LRM trends.","Sea level change,Tide gauge,Delay-Doppler Altimetry,"

"life history of an anticyclonic eddy in the algerian basin from altimetry data, tracking algorithm and in situ observations.","2020","Frequently-forming long-life mesoscale eddies are observed in the Algerian Basin that influence the circulation of the wider Western Mediterranean Sea. Most of these structures store and transport water masses including associated physical and biological properties throughout the entire basin. In order to study the evolution of a long-life anticyclonic eddy, we use a multiplatform approach based on remote sensing data analysis and in situ measurements. We present a case study of an anticyclonic eddy that persisted for 17 months within the basin. The feature was identified through a hybrid method of eddy detection and tracking applied to altimetry data, and sampled twice during two different oceanographic cruises in autumn 2004 and late spring 2005. Transect observations of potential temperature, salinity, density and the dissolved oxygen concentration were utilised to infer water mass properties and eddy characteristics. In situ data show that water of Atlantic origin, initially trapped by the eddy during its formation, was modified during the eddy lifetime. The time evolution of radius, kinetic energy and vorticity suggests dividing the eddy lifetime into three phases: the eddy formation, an intermediate period of high variability and a final, lower energy phase. The track followed by the eddy confirms the hypothesis of an interaction with the North Balearic Front and a consequent change of the eddy's physical properties. Decomposing the eddy's kinetic energy into mean and fluctuating terms allows us to describe its interaction with the mean circulation of the basin. In particular during formation, the southern part of the eddy absorbs energy from the mean circulation, while it provides energy to the mean flow in its northern part. In the second phase, when the eddy is far from the coast, it receives energy from the mean flow. Combining in situ data analysis with the results of the satellite-imagery-based detection and tracking method has proven to be a very useful method in assessing the evolution of a mesoscale structure in the Algerian Basin and its interaction with the large scale ocean dynamics of the Western Mediterranean Sea.",""
"use of the automatic identification system (ais) for maritime domain awareness (mda)","2005","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) was developed primarily as a tool for maritime safety - vessel collision avoidance, use by Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) and as a means for littoral states to get information on vessels operating near their coasts. AIS equipment aboard vessels continuously and autonomously transmits information about the vessel including its identity, position, course and speed to enhance safety. This information has also come to be seen by the U. S. Coast Guard as a critical tool in enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in support of all Coast Guard missions. MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States. To achieve MDA, the Coast Guard must collect as much information as possible on activities occurring in the maritime domain. A large part of this activity relates to the movement of vessels, therefore detection, classification, identification and monitoring of vessels is a key component of MDA.

"building defect detection: external versus internal thermography","2016","Many buildings suffer from defects in the building envelope, such as missing insulation, thermal bridging, cracks and moisture problems. Thermography is one technology that can help to identify such defects. However, there are different approaches towards assessing the building envelope. Pass-by thermography is an emerging method, which is used to capture single thermal images of external building elevations. Compared with traditional walk-through thermography, it is much quicker and cheaper to perform. Yet it is currently unclear how successful this methodology is at detecting building defects. This paper qualitatively compares pass-by thermography and walk-through thermography. A set of 122 residential dwellings in South West England was inspected using the both methodologies. Results show that substantially more defects were detected using walk-through thermography, with internal inspections yielding the greatest number of detected defects. Significant constraints with walk-past thermography were identified, such as unknown occupancy behaviour, transient climatic conditions, fixed viewing angles and spatial resolution limitations, which were all found to have a greater impact on image results than during walk-through thermography. Although trends in conductivity defects were found from target comparison analysis between similar dwellings, viewing single external elevations under walk-past thermography was found to miss many different defect types, which would have normally been discovered during traditional walk-through thermography.","Defect detection,Walk-past,Thermography,Walk-through,"

"belief modeling for maritime surveillance","2009","In maritime surveillance, the volume of information to be processed is very large and there is a great deal of uncertainty about the data. There are many vessels at sea at every point in time, and the vast majority of them pose no threat to security. Sifting through all of the benign activity to find unusual activities is a difficult problem. The problem is made even more difficult by the fact that the available data about vessel activities is both incomplete and inconsistent. In order to manage this uncertainty, automated anomaly detection software can be very useful in the early detection of threats to security. This paper introduces a high-level architecture for an anomaly detection system based on a formal model of beliefs with respect to each entity in some domain of interest. In this framework, the system has beliefs about the intentions of each vessel in the maritime domain. If the vessel behaves in an unexpected manner, these intentions are revised and a human operations centre worker is notified. This approach is flexible, scalable, and easily manages inconsistent information. Moreover, the approach has the pragmatic advantage that it uses expert information to inform decision making, but the required information is easily obtained through simple ranking exercises.","surveillance,Anomaly detection,automated anomaly detection software,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,security of data,Decision making,Information security,data uncertainty,belief modeling,Application software,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,Humans,Radar tracking,decision making,high-level architecture,belief revision,Uncertainty,Surveillance,Data security,"

Process Mining (PM), a set of business-process-related diagnostic and improvement techniques, can tackle these weaknesses, but literature lacks contributions that address this possibility concretely. Thus, by framing PM as an Expert System (ES) engine, this paper presents a five-step PM-based methodology for IS audits and validates it through a case in a freight export port process managed by a Port Community System (PCS), an open electronic platform enabling information exchange among port stakeholders. The validation pointed out some advantages (e.g. depth of analysis, easier automation, less invasiveness) of our PM-enabled methodology over extant ESs and tools for IS audit.

It can also classify and recognize sea surface targets through high-resolution ship target information provided by inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), grasp the situation of sea surface targets and deal with dangers when necessary, and response to dangerous sea targets. Therefore, the research of airborne ISAR ship target imaging is very important. Firstly, the working principle of airborne ISAR system is summarized, and the key problems faced by airborne ISAR system are analyzed.

"the use of nucella lapillus (l.) transplanted in cages to monitor tributyltin (tbt) pollution","2000","Specimens of the gastropod Nucella lapillus were transplanted from their natural habitat to sites affected by tributyltin (TBT) pollution to diverse degrees; individuals were held in cages that also included mussels as food. Subsamples were taken from the cages and the natural site at different time intervals (1, 2 and 5 months) to compare growth, imposex (a set of sexual anomalies caused by TBT) and butyltin concentrations accumulated in female tissues. Individuals in cages experienced negligible mortality and considerable growth. In addition, while the Relative Penis Size Index (RPSI, an index of imposex) remained consistent in the natural site through the experiment, it increased markedly at the implant sites; the same applies to the butyltin residues. These results are discussed to conclude that cage transplanting of N. lapillus is a suitable technique that can quickly (i.e. 1 month) detect differences in the level of TBT contamination among sites; however, extrapolation of experimental results to the field seems to require a longer exposure time (at least 5 months). Finally, the use of such an approach is deemed helpful to interpret the relationship between N. lapillus population dynamics and TBT pollution.","TBT pollution,Butyltin residues,Imposex,Transplants,"

"fractal detector design and application in maritime target detection","2017","The fractal properties of sea clutter are proposed and applied to the maritime target detection. Calculation of the measured data shows that, the Hurst exponent of the sea clutter with targets and the sea clutter without targets are different, which enables us to detect low-observable targets within the sea clutter. This paper explains the reason why the Hurst exponent can distinguish the presence or absence of targets in theory and proposes a fractal detector based on the Hurst exponent. Comparing the fractal detector proposed in this paper to the energy detector by the detection results of 140 frames data of the real sea clutter, it is demonstrated that the fractal detection method has a better detection performance. In order to get systemic conclusions, the new sea clutter data with different signal-to-clutter ratios (SCRs) are constructed in the way that add the sea clutter data with targets to the pure sea clutter data.

Then, dechirp-FFT is applied to integrate each echo in fast-time and DFR domain. Finally, each DFR integration result is back projected to local-coordinates according to its bistatic range.

"evidence for intensification of meteorological droughts in oman over the past four decades","2020","Spatial and temporal variability of drought in Oman was assessed for the period 1979–2014 using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at both seasonal (3-month) and annual (12-month) timescales. Changes in drought characteristics (e.g. frequency, duration, intensity, severity, and spatial extent) were detected for six distinct climatic regions delineated using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results suggest a statistically significant increase in the frequency and severity of drought during the past four decades. Nonetheless, drought exhibited pronounced decadal variability, with more frequent and severe droughts occurring after 1997/1998. Also, results demonstrate that the areas influenced by extreme and very extreme droughts witnessed a statistically significant increase on the order of 0.13% and 0.18%/decade, respectively, compared to −0.06%/decade for the areas impacted by mild droughts. Spatially, there has been a prevalent drying trend in central and eastern regions of Oman, while a tendency towards wetter conditions was observed in northern Oman (especially in the Batinah plain). This study also investigates the time-varying dependency between climatic drivers of drought and large-scale circulation patterns using the cumulative annual mean (CAM) method. Results indicate an acceleration of drying after 1997/1998, mainly due to the warming sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Atlantic Ocean in recent decades and also the shift of the Pacific Ocean circulation patterns (e.g. PDO and El Nino) from the positive to the negative mode at the end of the 1990s. These configurations are favorable for significant changes in the thermodynamic drivers of drought (i.e. air temperature and relative humidity), but have less influence on aerodynamic drivers (i.e. wind speed). The significant temperature rise in recent decades, combined with a significant decline of rainfall and relative humidity, can explain the prolonged drought episode lasting from 1998 to 2014. A comprehensive assessment of drought variability in a poorly-studied water-stressed region like Oman is of particular concern for stakeholders and policy-makers. This study provides meaningful conclusions and a basis for water resources management, agricultural and energy production, ecological protection, and contribute to more reliable drought mitigation strategies at the regional and national scales.","Rainfall,SPEI,Principal Components Analysis,Circulation patterns,Drought,Oman,"
"global climate change in the instrumental period","1994","The instrumental period of climate history began in the 18th century with the commencement of routine weather observations at fixed sites. Estimates of global-mean climate (e.g. temperature and precipitation) were not possible, however, until the establishment of extensive observing networks midway through the 19th century. This paper reviews our knowledge of global climate change in the instrumental period. Time series of global-mean temperature and precipitation are examined and a comparison is made between two independent 30-year climatologies: 1931–1960 and 1961–1990. Examples are also provided of regional-scale climate changes. Such assessments are important for two reasons. First, they establish the variability of climate on the time-scale of decades, time-scales upon which it is reasonable to plan economic and socio-political activities. Second, and more specifically, they enable us to quantify the magnitude of global-mean climate change which has occurred over this period. Such detailed diagnostic climate information is a necessary, although not sufficient, prerequisite for the detection of global-scale warming which may have occurred due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Some attention is given to explanations of the observed changes in global-mean climate.","global temperature,global warming,instrumental data,climate change,global precipitation,"
"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"

"tracing illegal oil discharges from vessels using sar and ais in bohai sea of china","2021","In China's 14th Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to coordinate the promotion of marine ecological protection and prevent environmental risks such as marine oil spills. The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.","Synthetic aperture radar,Illegal discharge,Automatic identification system,Oil spill,"
"detecting maneuvers in maritime observation data with cusum","2017","Understanding and building suitable marine traffic and prediction models is a difficult undertaking. To build such a model, it is necessary to understand vessels behavior and have knowledge about the driving patterns. In general, a complex dynamic model for several ship types is used.

That is why a simpler solution for detecting maneuvers in maritime observation data is needed. We present a light approach to detect maneuver in maritime observation data without information about the vessel dynamic.

"spatial relationship between phytophthora ramorum and roads or streams in oregon tanoak forests","2014","The pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of sudden oak death (SOD) of oaks and tanoaks, continues to expand its range within Oregon despite an effort to eradicate it from native forests. With its early detection and prompt removal of infected hosts, the Oregon SOD eradication program has produced a landscape distribution of disease resulting predominantly from the long distance (100m to 4km) dispersal of inoculum between sites. Using a regionally restricted randomization test reflecting the south to north intensification of the SOD epidemic in Oregon, we assessed if the movement of P. ramorum between sites was spatially dependant upon roads and streams, topographic features associated with the landscape-scale movement of soil and water borne inoculum of related Phytophthora spp. Dissimilar to other forest Phytophthora spp. we found no association between SOD sites and the road network. We did, however, determine that SOD sites are occurring closer to streams than would be expected by chance, especially in regions with microclimates less conducive to establishment. Environmental conditions and/or dispersal mechanisms associated with streams may contribute to the distribution of SOD in Oregon tanoak forests. Monitoring and management should therefore concentrate on susceptible forests in close proximity to streams, especially in stands further inland from a coastal climate.","Sudden oak death,Spatial spread,Invasive pathogen,Forest pathology,Restricted randomization,"
"eeg-based maritime object detection for iot-driven surveillance systems in smart ocean","2020","Automated maritime object detection is a significant research challenge in intelligent marine surveillance systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ocean applications. In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","medical signal processing,surveillance,Electroencephalography,Electroencephalography (EEG),Internet of Things (IoT),ship detection,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,maritime image scenes,Feature extraction,smart ocean applications,IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems,maritime object detection,automated maritime object detection,ships,electroencephalography-based maritime object detection algorithm,Oceans,object detection,feature extraction,intelligent surveillance systems,IoT-driven marine surveillance systems,IoT devices,image sensors,smart ocean,Object detection,Surveillance,learning (artificial intelligence),electroencephalography,"

"temperature and precipitation trends and dryness/wetness pattern in the zhujiang river basin, south china, 1961–2007","2011","Spatial and temporal characteristics of temperature and precipitation in the Zhujiang River Basin, South China, are analysed in order to identify tendencies in dryness and wetness. Trend tests are applied to daily temperature and precipitation data from 1961 to 2007 of 192 weather stations. Nine indicators are applied in order to detect cycles of dryness and wetness and are compared with the drought indices Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Tendencies in temperature and precipitation characteristics can be observed. Significant positive trends (>90% confidence level) can be found for annual temperature, number of warm days, longest warm period, no rain days, and longest dry period. A significant increase in temperature by more than 0.7K from 1961 to 2007 can be observed in the entire basin and the coastal and far western areas in particular. Negative trends are observed for annual cool days, cool period, wet days, and wet period. Almost no significant trends in annual mean and extreme precipitation are detected. Rain days decreased, and a tendency to longer dry periods and shorter wet periods can be observed. The magnitude of indices describing dryness has increased in the Zhujiang River Basin, and dry periods have become longer while wet periods have shortened in time. Rainfall intensity has increased along the coastline and in the far west of the catchment. This tendency can be partially explained by the weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon. Regarding the high temperature increases, the influences of the urban heat island effect due to urbanization and industrialization, especially along the coast and at the delta, should be considered. The high station density and data quality are very useful for describing detailed changes in wetness and dryness in the Zhujiang River basin.",""
"potential of stochastic methods for improving convection-permitting ensemble forecasts of extreme events over the western mediterranean","2021","The design of convection-permitting ensemble prediction systems capable of producing accurate forecasts of disruptive events is an extraordinarily challenging effort. The difficulties associated with the detection of extreme events found at these scales motivates the research of methodologies that efficiently sample relevant uncertainties. This study investigates the potential of multiple techniques to account for model uncertainty. The performance of various stochastic schemes is assessed for an exceptional heavy precipitation episode which occurred in eastern Spain. In particular, the stochastic strategies are compared to a multiphysics approach in terms of both spread and skill. The analyzed techniques include stochastic parameterization perturbation tendency and perturbations to influential parameters within the microphysics scheme. The introduction of stochastic perturbations to the microphysics processes results in a larger ensemble spread throughout the entire simulation. Conversely, modifications to microphysics parameters generate small-scale perturbations that rapidly grow over areas with high convective instability, in contrast to the other methods, which produce more widespread perturbations. A conclusion of specific interest for the western Mediterranean, where deep moist convection and local orography play an important role, is that stochastic methods are shown to outperform a multiphysics-based ensemble for this case, indicating the potential positive impact of stochastic parameterizations for the forecast of extreme events in the region.","Microphysics,Ensemble prediction systems,Stochastic parameterization,Western Mediterranean,Heavy precipitation episodes,"
"high spatial resolution mapping of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide using airborne imaging spectroscopy: radiative transfer modeling and power plant plume detection","2013","Carbon dioxide is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels and is an important contributor to anthropogenic climate change. Multiple current and planned satellite missions are designed to quantify atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on a global scale, but most of these sensors do not have the spatial resolution necessary to resolve point sources such as fossil fuel power plants. Airborne imaging spectrometer data, such as those from the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), can have multiple, contiguous bands covering shortwave infrared (SWIR) absorption features produced by carbon dioxide. Therefore, high spatial resolution data from AVIRIS-like sensors may offer a means for detecting plumes and retrieving carbon dioxide concentrations for point source emissions. The objectives of this study include modeling minimum carbon dioxide anomalies detectable in AVIRIS data under different conditions and applying a Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter for detection of carbon dioxide plumes in simulated data and in AVIRIS images acquired over power plants. Radiative transfer simulations were used to model the residual radiance produced by increased absorption by carbon dioxide as concentration was elevated above background levels within a 0–500m layer. Carbon dioxide anomalies, surface reflectance, water vapor concentration, solar zenith angle, sensor height, and aerosol scattering were varied in simulation sets and the resulting residual radiance spectra were compared against noise equivalent delta radiance (NEdL) for the “classic” and “next generation” AVIRIS instruments. Sensitivity to carbon dioxide anomalies improved with increased surface reflectance and declined with increased water vapor concentration, solar zenith angle, sensor height, and aerosol scattering. Zero to 500m concentration anomalies as low as 100 parts per milion by volume (ppm) for AVIRIS C and 25ppm for AVIRIS NG produced residual radiance values that exceeded SWIR NEdL. Carbon dioxide concentrations modeled for a generic power plant emissions scenario using a plume dispersion model were combined with randomly-generated reflectance spectra to create simulated images with varying surface reflectance and NEdL. For these simulated images, true positive and false positive detection rates improved as background reflectance increased and as NEdL decreased. Apparent plumes were detected in all four AVIRIS C images acquired over power plants, although the characteristics of the plumes varied according to solar-plume-sensor geometry. Improvements in modeling may allow retrieval of plume concentration, providing a valuable means for quantifying point source emissions and a basis for comparison with column concentrations retrieved from in situ measurements and coarse resolution satellite data.","Fossil fuel power plant,MODTRAN,Imaging spectroscopy,Noise equivalent delta radiance,CO emissions,AVIRIS NG,Hyperspectral data,AVIRIS C,"

"data gap analysis of ship and maritime data using meta learning","2021","With the developments in new Internet of Things (IoT) technology, ship owners and managers can access and analyze vast amounts of real-time onboard data. However, data collected from the ship’s engine and navigation information include various types of errors owing to imprecision, bias, sensor failure, or human error caused by manual recording by the ship operator’s hands. Such abnormal data make accurate ship performance prediction and monitoring difficult; thus, the original data need to be carefully refined through data preprocessing. Machine learning models have been used to detect and remove abnormal data; however, this yields inconsistent predictions in results depending on the types of machine learning models used. In this study, a robust data gap analysis method is proposed to detect abnormal data among ship and marine data collected in real time. Data preprocessing, including rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension reduction, is systematically performed; subsequently, a meta-learning model, which is a combination of various machine learning models, is used to predict ship performance and detect its abnormal data. This study compared the performance of single-machine learning models and meta models through various error analysis methods that utilize actual ship operation data. The single machine leading models have various error values depending on types of data and models, while the meta model consistently has values of less than 5% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), showing a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient(NSE) value of 0.7 or higher. Our proposed data gap analysis framework, including the meta-learning model, can be useful for monitoring the condition of ships, as it can more accurately and robustly classify them as normal or abnormal.","Data preprocessing,Machine learning error measures,Meta learning,Data gap analysis,"
"the use of sar-ati for maritime surveillance and difficult target detection","2009","This paper discusses the detection of low scatter cross-section maritime targets in a high clutter background using SAR multi-channel along track interferometry. Statistical arguments are presented based on the covariance matrix which enable the determination of the channel weights required to achieve maximum attenuation of false alarms produced by breaking waves. An example is shown of a target (a buoy) with scatter cross-section comparable with the false alarms. A false alarm attenuation of up to 16.1 dB relative to the target is demonstrated for a three-beam interferometer with no a priori knowledge of the target or false alarms. Applications include detection of small stealthy boats and other difficult maritime targets.","high clutter background,SAR-ATI,breaking waves,covariance matrices,electromagnetic wave interferometers,maritime target detection,marine radar,low scatter cross-section maritime target detection,Radar antennas,Horn antennas,MATI,radar clutter,Spatial resolution,STAP,SAR multichannel,maximum attenuation,false alarm attenuation,Radar scattering,target tracking,covariance matrix,maritime surveillance,Target tracking,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,search radar,Radar tracking,radar imaging,three-beam interferometer,Multichannel SAR,radar tracking,Radar imaging,Clutter,Object detection,Surveillance,Ocean imaging,component,electromagnetic wave scattering,radar cross-sections,track interferometry,channel weights,"
"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.","Kinematics,surveillance,hidden Markov models,interactive situation analysis,Hidden Markov models,Geospatial analysis,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,maritime domain awareness,marine traffic data analysis,data fusion,information fusion,data analysis,Maritime Domain Awareness,vessel engagement,routine surveillance operations,marine engineering,support vector machines,kinematic features,probabilistic processes,geospatial features,machine learning,left-to-right hidden Markov models,vessel interaction classification,innovative intelligent systems,pattern classification,contextual information,Time series analysis,maritime situation analysis framework,Critical Infrastructure Protection,Big Data,vessel tracking data,Trajectory,Machine Learning,probability,complex vessel trajectory analysis,pattern representation,traffic engineering computing,Surveillance,maritime domain knowledge,marine vehicles,Intelligent Systems,learning (artificial intelligence),Security,security,"

"an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components","2019","In recent years, the reliability and safety requirements of ship systems have increased drastically. This has prompted a paradigm shift toward the development of prognostics and health management (PHM) approaches for these systems' critical maritime components. In light of harsh environmental conditions with varying operational loads, and a lack of fault labels in the maritime industry generally, any PHM solution for maritime components should include independent and intelligent fault detection algorithms that can report faults automatically. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm for maritime components. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are verified on five different data sets of real operational run-to-failure data provided by a highly regarded industrial company. Each data set is subject to a fault at an unknown time step. In addition, different magnitudes of random white Gaussian noise are applied to each data set in order to create several real-life situations. The results suggest that the algorithm is highly suitable to be included as part of a pure data-driven diagnostics approach in future end-to-end PHM system solutions.","maritime components,ship systems,Prediction algorithms,unsupervised learning,reliability,Maintenance engineering,deep learning,ships,Prognostics and health management,random white Gaussian noise,Gaussian noise,Fault detection,Machine learning algorithms,Degradation,condition monitoring,maritime industry,Automatic fault detection,Signal processing algorithms,remaining life assessment,intelligent fault detection algorithm,unsupervised reconstruction-based fault detection algorithm,prognostics and health management,fault diagnosis,"
"a-contrario structural inference for space object detection and tracking","2022","Monitoring space assets for safety and sustainability compliance requires active measurement of positional information, commonly done via optical remote sensing in which image-frame coordinates are extracted from a high-noise environment of stellar, atmospheric, and hardware features. This task has been traditionally approached by using a-priori models to differentiate potential Anthropogenic Space Objects from the background noise. Source extraction and track-before-detect methods rely on absolute pixel intensity thresholding and require substantial processing to remove noise (stars, hot pixels, etc.), while machine learning shows promise in reducing processing and improving low-visibility performance but requires context-specific labeled training data. We introduce a new approach based on a-contrario detection, arguing that any space object must be unattributable to noise using a sequence of low-fidelity hypotheses. Through this approach, we aim to relax the dependency on a-priori assumptions of data content and improve performance where high-quality data is sparse, poorly labeled, or challenging to characterize, e.g., in satellite-based applications, and provide detection confidence measures from individual data content to enhance risk evaluation for orbital populations. We present an initial qualitative proof-of-concept for our a-contrario approach using data collected by the ASTRIANet telescope network, showing potentially strong performance on Medium Earth Orbit observations for both rate and sidereal-tracking telescope modes. We also discuss how our approach handles epistemic uncertainties, i.e., a lack of a-priori model information, with implications to Type I and Type II error sources and potential mitigation steps when considering Low Earth Orbit observations with higher tracking noise.","Object tracking,A-contrario detection,Space domain awareness,Image processing,"

"are meteorological conditions favoring hail precipitation change in southern europe? analysis of the period 1948–2015","2017","In the context of a warming climate, one of the variables currently under investigation is related to the detection of possible changes in hail precipitation. In this work, we analyze hail frequencies in one of the most affected areas by this phenomenon in Europe, southern France. Here, an extensive hail detection network has been in operation since 1988. In general, the detection of hailfall is very uncertain. To overcome the constraints of scarcity and poor standardization of hail detection and monitoring systems, some relationships between hailstorm occurrence and synoptic, mesoscale or thermodynamic atmospheric characteristics have been proposed in different areas. Therefore, we analyzed meteorological fields at synoptic scale that are related to the formation of hailstorms in the study area, i.e., geopotential height at 500hPa, sea level pressure, and lapse-rate between 850 and 500hPa. These fields describe the state of the atmosphere at low and mid levels, and facilitate the evaluation of thermal and dynamic instability. Using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen estimator, we examined trends in the three fields during the period 1948–2015 and their spatial patterns, revealing an evolution toward synoptic environments that favor hail precipitation in the Mediterranean region.","Southern Europe,Trends,Synoptic environments,Hailfalls,"
"maritime small target detection based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency in infrared video with dense sunglints","2023","Maritime infrared (IR) small target detection in dense sunglint environments has always been challenging. It is difficult for existing methods to distinguish the small target from dense and strong sea clutter because the sea clutter caused by the sunglints has similar spatialâ€“temporal characteristics to small targets. This article proposes a method based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS) for small target detection in IR videos or sequences. First, on each frame of the IR video, the isotropic salience measure (ISM) based on principal curvature filtering is proposed for target enhancement, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract a stable number of candidate targets. Then, we use improved pipeline filtering to form trajectory chains of the candidate targets extracted from the consecutive frames. To improve the matching accuracy of pipeline filtering, we propose an inverse optical flow method to predict the local images of the candidate targets. Third, the motion vectors of the candidate targets are extracted and depth-normalized. According to the principle of projection perspective, a depth normalization model based on the position of the sea-sky line is established, providing a simple and low-cost solution for acquiring depth information of maritime targets under sea-sky backgrounds. Finally, the appearance stability measure (ASM) and the depth-normalized motion saliency measure (DNMSM) are calculated to construct the AS-DNMS joint feature. A double asymptote decision function is employed to determine the real target. The experimental results show that our method has better detection performance in dense sunglint environments than the baseline methods.","Appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS),Pipelines,target detection,radar clutter,target enhancement,Sea measurements,IR video,dense sunglint environment,strong sea clutter,isotropic salience measure (ISM),object detection,dense sunglints,feature extraction,maritime targets,Sea surface,improved pipeline filtering,infrared (IR) small target detection,depth-normalized motion saliency measure,dense sunglint environments,depth normalization model,Trajectory,image sequences,Tensors,Clutter,Object detection,appearance stability measure,infrared video,sequences,candidate targets,sea-sky line,isotropic salience measure,pipeline filtering,dense sea clutter,"
"sa-hpmht for maritime dim targets tracking with sensor location uncertainty","2023","To address the problem of tracking low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) maritime targets with sensor location uncertainty, an effective track-before-detect (TBD) method, called the state augmentation histogram probabilistic multihypothesis tracking (SA-HPMHT) algorithm, is proposed in this article. In this algorithm, the initialization of new tracks is realized based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector with a low threshold and the  ${K}$ -means clustering algorithm. The target and sensor states are then simultaneously estimated in an iterative manner via a synthetic histogram and state augmentation (SA) method. In each iteration, we update the estimated sensor state and yield more accurate measured images, allowing for improved performance of detection and tracking targets. Finally, an  ${M}/{N}$  logic technology is invoked to confirm or terminate the tracks.

"effects of climate variability and change on snowpack hydrological processes in finland","2015","This study evaluated the effects of climate variability and change on snowpack hydrological processes (SHPs) in terms of liquid water refreezing, water storage as snow water equivalent (SWE) and outflow as total liquid water leaving the snowpack induced by snowmelt flux (melt water releasing from the snowpack after its maximum liquid water retention capacity is reached) and/or rainfall in Finland during the past 100years. Long-term (>100years) daily precipitation and temperature records from three meteorological stations (Sodankylä in northern, Kajaani in central and Kaisaniemi in southern Finland) were used in an empirical snowmelt temperature-index model to simulate different SHPs. The Mann–Kendall non-parametric test was used to detect statistically significant (p<0.05) trends, the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts (STARS) to determine cold–mild and wet–dry climate modes, Pearson's coefficient (r) to measure temperature-precipitation and SWE correlations, and Spearman's rank correlation (rho) to identify linkages of these variables to well-known atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs) over the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. the Arctic Oscillation). Observed mean annual temperature significantly warmed, by a rate of 0.01°Cyear−1, at both Kaisaniemi during 1845–2011 and Sodankylä during 1908–2011, which was also associated with a shift from cold to mild climate in 1930 at Kaisaniemi and in 1988 at Sodankylä. However, mean annual temperature showed no clear trend at Kajaani, which was confirmed by the existence of periodicities in cold–mild climatic modes. Conversely, observed total annual precipitation decreased by 0.8mmyear−1 (p<0.05) only at Kajaani during 1903–2008, which was in accordance with the climate shift from wet to dry mode in 1939. The simulated peak annual SWE significantly decreased in the range 0.57–1.47mmyear−1 at all three stations studied during the 20th century, with the highest rate at Sodankylä. Comparisons of simulated 1-day to 10-day peak outflow indicated that snowmelt flux influenced simulated peak snowpack outflow much more than rainfall. Hence, the magnitude of simulated annual 1- and 10-day peak outflows decreased by 0.055±0.01 and 0.45±0.25mmyear−1 (p<0.05), respectively, in Finland during the last century. Moreover, simulated annual 1-day peak outflow timing significantly shifted to 12–28days earlier, while simulated annual 10-day peak outflow timing shifted to 8–40 days earlier (p<0.05). These results indicate that the snow resource in Finland has significantly declined during the past 100years under climate variability and change, partly controlled by the Arctic Oscillation, East Atlantic/West Russia, and East Atlantic patterns across the country.","Atmospheric circulation,Regime shifts,Snowpack hydrological processes,Finland,Climate change,Trend analysis,"
"narrowband interference suppression algorithm applied to integrated communication and sensing systems in maritime environments","2022","We will build an integrated communication and perception system that has the ability to detect targets and communicate with downstream users.

Aiming at this problem, a set of narrow-band interference cancellation algorithm combined with the integrated communication perception system is designed. This algorithm improves the classic threshold algorithm to achieve threshold adaptation. Finally, simulation shows the harm caused by narrow-band interference and the necessity of removing narrow-band interference.

"a taxonomy and survey of cyber-physical intrusion detection approaches for vehicles","2019","With the growing threat of cyber and cyber-physical attacks against automobiles, drones, ships, driverless pods and other vehicles, there is also a growing need for intrusion detection approaches that can facilitate defence against such threats. Vehicles tend to have limited processing resources and are energy-constrained. So, any security provision needs to abide by these limitations. At the same time, attacks against vehicles are very rare, often making knowledge-based intrusion detection systems less practical than behaviour-based ones, which is the reverse of what is seen in conventional computing systems. Furthermore, vehicle design and implementation can differ wildly between different types or different manufacturers, which can lead to intrusion detection designs that are vehicle-specific. Equally importantly, vehicles are practically defined by their ability to move, autonomously or not. Movement, as well as other physical manifestations of their operation may allow cyber security breaches to lead to physical damage, but can also be an opportunity for detection. For example, physical sensing can contribute to more accurate or more rapid intrusion detection through observation and analysis of physical manifestations of a security breach. This paper presents a classification and survey of intrusion detection systems designed and evaluated specifically on vehicles and networks of vehicles. Its aim is to help identify existing techniques that can be adopted in the industry, along with their advantages and disadvantages, as well as to identify gaps in the literature, which are attractive and highly meaningful areas of future research.","Intrusion detection,VANET,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Robotic land vehicles,Cyber-physical systems,Vehicular networks,Aircraft,Vehicles,Cyber security,Driverless pods,Automobiles,"
"spatio-temporal detection for dengue outbreaks in the central region of malaysia using climatic drivers at mesoscale and synoptic scale","2022","The disease dengue is associated with both mesoscale and synoptic scale meteorology. However, previous studies for south-east Asia have found a very limited association between synoptic variables and the reported number of dengue cases. Hence there is an urgent need to establish a more clear association with dengue incidence rates and the most relevant meteorological variables in order to institute an early warning system. This article develops a rigorous Bayesian modelling framework to identify the most important covariates and their lagged effects for constructing an early warning system for the Central Region of Malaysia where the case rates have increased substantially in the recent past. Our modelling includes multiple synoptic scale Niño indices, which are related to the phenomenon of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), along with other relevant mesoscale environmental measurements and an unobserved variable derived from reanalysis data. An empirically well validated hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal is used to build a probabilistic early warning system for detecting an upcoming dengue epidemic. Our study finds a 46.87% increase in dengue cases due to one degree increase in the central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature with a lag time of six weeks. We discover the existence of a mild association with relative risk 0.9774 (CI: 0.9602, 0.9947) between the rate of cases and a distant lagged cooling effect in the region of coastal South America related to a phenomenon called El Niño Modoki. The Bayesian model also establishes that the synoptic meteorological drivers can enhance short-term early detection of dengue outbreaks and these can also potentially be used to provide longer-term forecasts.","early warning system,ENSO,dengue,Bayesian spatio-temporal model,El Niño Modoki,BYM2,"
"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions.

It is suited for airborne platforms and future high-altitude platforms (HAP). The concept uses range-compressed single- and multichannel radar data as input and doesnâ€™t require time consuming synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing as conventionally needed when it comes to ship detection with spaceborne SAR systems. Small coherent processing intervals (CPIs) are used for detecting and tracking the ships in range-Doppler domain. In addition to the reduced processing requirements, the range-Doppler domain has the advantage that even ships with small radar cross section (RCS) can be detected when they move with a certain line-of-sight velocity so that their signals are shifted in Doppler to the exo-clutter region. In the paper the overall processing concept is briefly discussed and the effectiveness is demonstrated by using real radar data acquired with DLRâ€™s airborne radar sensors F-SAR [1] and DBFSAR [2].",""

"analysis of effectiveness of fire safety in machinery spaces","2019","The primary cause of machinery space fires is cited as the release of flammable oil mist contacting unprotected hot surfaces. With this being common knowledge why do we continue to see this type of incident reoccurring on ships carrying thousands of passengers to precarious destinations? We review regulatory and Class requirements with respect to fire safety, Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) as a rule-making instrument of the IMO, accident investigation recommendations involving fire, fire safety technology, and research literature. For each constituent of fire safety control, the paper aims to determine the preferred strategies for accident prevention and their relative cost effectiveness. Subsequently, the cost effectiveness of the current safety approach is established. This review found that fire prevention could be made more cost effective if its scope was broadened beyond the detection of proximate events occurring immediately before ignition. The findings suggest that more cost-effective safety measures can be developed by addressing systemic causes of fire. Removal of the systemic causal factors of fire from the equation, means we can address fire safety prior to the moments before ignition when the point of no return can unwittingly be passed. The paper suggests directions of how this can be achieved.","Safety barriers,Marine safety,Fire prevention,Fire safety,Machinery space,"
"siamfpn: a deep learning method for accurate and real-time maritime ship tracking","2021","Visual object tracking plays an essential role in various maritime applications. However, most of the existing tracking methods belong to generative models, which only focus on the features of the object and require the target has significant visual saliency for accurate tracking. While the visual saliency is available in most of the common tracking conditions, these methods may fail when facing challenging situations. In this paper, a deep learning based tracking method is proposed to track maritime ships, namely, SiamFPN. In SiamFPN, a modified Siamese Network is combined with multi-RPNs to build a tracking pipeline. Concretely, A ResNet-50 with an FPN structure is used as the CNN of the detection subnetwork of Siamese, and a template subnetwork is parallel to the detection. In order to strengthen the discriminative ability, three RPNs are deployed to process the output of Siamese Network. Moreover, a historical impacts based proposal selection method is developed for selecting correct target areas. Finally, a dataset is collected for training and testing SiamFPN and validating our excellent performance over the other four recent SOTA trackers.

The learning framework is performed on the basis of a machine learning approach that combines constrained K-means clustering for outlier detection and fuzzy modeling of distances to normality. A final score is also calculated over time, considering the membership degree to resulting fuzzy sets and a local outlier factor. Proposed solution is deployed in a CBM+ platform for online monitoring of the assets. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real operational faults in an auxiliary marine diesel engine. Experimental results show a fully comprehensive yet accurate prognostics approach, improving detection capabilities and knowledge management.

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction.

The objective image quality assessment also indicates that TASHE algorithm can improve the original maritime imageâ€™s Enhancement Measure by Entropy (EME) value, furthermore, when a maritime image is pre-processed by TASHE algorithm, the maritime targetâ€™s Detection Rate (DR) can be improved.","pure maritime image,Image enhancement,image denoising,entropy,adaptive threshold,enhancement algorithm,image enhancement,Image color analysis,image colour analysis,adaptive sub-histograms equalization algorithm,marine engineering,sub-histogram equalization,object detection,Adaptive equalizers,objective image quality assessment,Brightness,maritime image histograms,wavelet transforms,correlation methods,Histograms,infrared imaging,maritime image,visible color maritime image,Fitting,original maritime image,Gaussian distribution,visible gray maritime image,histogram,TASHE algorithm,maritime target,maritime image enhancement,"
"a wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient covid-19 diagnosis via ct slices","2022","The quick diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is vital to prevent its propagation and improve therapeutic outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CT scan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studies employed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3D multiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatial information of the original CT images to train their models, though, using spectral–temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. This article proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV. Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels to train three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral–temporal information of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, it investigates whether the combination of spatial information with spectral–temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral–temporal features from such ResNets using transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes a feature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features and use them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark dataset called SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet have demonstrated that using the spectral–temporal information of the DWT heatmap images to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information of the original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral–temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOV and SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify the outstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus, CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Convolutional neural networks,Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),Deep learning,Computed tomography (CT),COVID-19,ResNet,"
"technologies to aid decision making for maritime security","2012","The paper presents 3 key technologies used in an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system [1]. These technologies fuse maritime data for decision support in the martime security domain. They support monitoring of scenarios of interest such as terrorist attacks or piracy incidents, and alert operators when such scenarios are assessed likely to happen. These 3 technologies are: a. Dynamic Bayesian Reasoning & Advanced Intelligent Networks (D'Brain), a reasoning system based on Bayesian networks. Causal and probabilistic information about scenarios of interest are structured as Bayesian networks, in which variables are set according to the interpretation of incoming situation information. The system thus provides a systematic approach to modelling and monitoring for scenarios of interest in the maritime situation. b. Graylist Ranking, a ranking technique to order entities based on their structural relationship with black-listed entities. The ranked list of entities could then be used to prioritize further investigation efforts into higher ranking entities which are considered more suspicious. c. Trajectory Analysis using a nonparametric Bayesian model, Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP) [2]. It models the activity patterns (norm) of entities in motion. With the norm established, anomaly detection could be performed by evaluating how much each track deviates from the norm.","systematic approach,Dynamic Reasoning,trajectory analysis,sensor fusion,operator alerts,entity list ranking,causal information,situation information,black-listed entity ordering,anomaly detection,Anomaly Detection,Monitoring,maritime data fusion,belief networks,Knowledge engineering,computerised monitoring,Noise measurement,Scenario Modeling,entity activity pattern norm,martime security domain,Bayesian methods,structural relationship,marine safety,Cognitive science,marine engineering,D'Brain,nonparametric statistics,nonparametric Bayesian model,probabilistic information,Relationship Analysis,integrated maritime monitoring system,decision making,Trending,Graylist ranking technique,inference mechanisms,intelligent networks,probability,dual-HDP,dynamic Bayesian reasoning-and-advanced intelligent networks,Cognition,Computational modeling,terrorist attacks,dual-hierarchical Dirichlet processes,scenario-of-interest,decision support,integrated maritime reasoning system,piracy incidents,"
"a cognitive maritime sar concept for high altitude platforms","2019","This paper introduces a novel cognitive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) concept for multifunctional maritime operation. The proposed system relies on the interaction with the environment to select autonomously the areas of high interest and adapt the next transmission configuration on the fly. Thus, it becomes feasible to control the different parameters and scanning combinations to reach a high imaging and tracking performance with less complexity compared to the fixed operating state-of-the-art sensors.
