"dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array for communication, maritime navigation and surveillance radar","2015","This paper describes the development of a dualband slotted waveguide antenna for communication, navigation and surveillance radar applications. Two different slot sizes on opposite faces are designed for enabling antenna operation over two different frequency bands. In this way, it becomes possible to perform diverse sorts of tracking using a unique structure. Numerical results, obtained using ANSYS HFSS, demonstrate the proposed antenna provides two bandwidths of approximately 15% and 6.5% for S-band and C-band, respectively. The antenna gain varies from 12.7dBi at 2.2 GHz to 16.37dBi at 4.6GHz.","multifrequency antennas,C-band,Radar antennas,Antenna arrays,gain 16.37 dB,slot antenna arrays,ANSYS HFSS,dual-band slotted waveguide antenna array,maritime navigation,search radar,S-band,Radar,Slot antennas,Electromagnetic waveguides,radionavigation,bandwidth 4.6 GHz,bandwidth 2.2 GHz,numerical analysis,surveillance radar,gain 12.7 dB,Arrays,"
"a generic approach to analysing failures in human – system interaction in autonomy","2020","Autonomous systems operation will in the foreseeable future rely on the interaction between software, hardware and humans. Efficient interaction and communication between these agents are crucial for safe operation. Conventional methods for hazard identification and safety assessment focus often on one of the aspects of the system only, e.g., human reliability, software failures, or equipment reliability. The method Human-System Interaction in Autonomy (H-SIA) was recently proposed, focusing on autonomous ships operation and collision scenarios. H-SIA provides a framework for analyzing autonomous ship operation as an entirety, rather than each agent separately. The method comprised initially of two main elements: An Event Sequence Diagram (ESD) and a Concurrent Task Analysis (CoTA). While the ESD models the events that can take place following an initiating event, the CoTA models which tasks the agents must perform for these events to succeed. This paper extends H-SIA to include the paths to failure, through the development of Fault Trees (FTs), which is necessary for risk analysis and identification of risk reduction measures. The FTs development of H-SIA introduces novelties in comparison to common FTs: (i) they model the system as whole, (ii) they are generic and can accommodate a diversity of systems designs; (iii) they lead to basic failure events. The FTs allows for identification of failure events arising through interaction between autonomous ship and human operators, as well as failure propagation through these agents. The basic failure events are applicable for different autonomous concepts. A case study on autonomous ship collision demonstrates the use of the extended method. The case study illustrates H-SIA’s applicability to different designs and levels of autonomy, its potential for identification of failure events, and its use in risk assessments.","System design,Human-autonomy interaction,Risk assessment,Autonomous systems,Autonomous ship,"
"deep reinforcement learning based joint edge resource management in maritime network","2020","Due to the rapid development of the maritime networks, there has been a growing demand for computation-intensive applications which have various energy consumption, transmission bandwidth and computing latency requirements. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can efficiently minimize computational latency by offloading computation tasks by the terrestrial access network. In this work, we introduce a space-air-ground-sea integrated network architecture with edge and cloud computing components to provide flexible hybrid computing service for maritime service. In the integrated network, satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide the users with edge computing services and network access. Based on the architecture, the joint communication and computation resource allocation problem is modelled as a complex decision process, and a deep reinforcement learning based solution is designed to solve the complex optimization problem. Finally, numerical results verify that the proposed approach can improve the communication and computing efficiency greatly.","maritime network,Satellites,unmanned aerial vehicles,computation-intensive applications,computing latency requirements,telecommunication network management,maritime network service,computation resource allocation problem,telecommunication computing,Resource management,space-air-ground-sea integrated network architecture,satellite communication,deep learning,Servers,cloud computing,optimisation,mobile edge computing services,deep reinforcement learning based solution,edge computing,terrestrial access network,joint edge resource management,flexible hybrid computing service,reinforcement learning,Computer architecture,MEC,decision theory,computation offload,Edge computing,energy consumption,Cloud computing,marine communication,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),transmission bandwidth,resource allocation,computation latency,UAV,"
"maritime mobile optical-propagation channel measurements","2010","Optical free-space communications (FSO) is an emerging solution to operate very high capacity non-detectable links. The performance of laser communication systems is reduced by random power fluctuations of the received signal. In this paper fade statistics obtained from experimental data were compared with statistical mathematical models and it was found that the log-normal model fits well under a wide range of turbulence conditions. Therefore we investigate in a more practical way the performance of laser transmission in a commercially available mobile communication system.

"detecting and hunting cyberthreats in a maritime environment: specification and experimentation of a maritime cybersecurity operations centre","2018","The vast majority of worldwide goods exchanges are made by sea. In some parts of the world, the concurrence for dominance at sea is very high and definitely seen as a main military goal. Meanwhile, new generation ships highly rely on information systems for communication, navigation and platform management. This ever-spreading attack surface and permanent satellite links have grown a concern about the potential impact of cyberattacks on a ship at sea or on naval shore infrastructures. Therefore, on top of the usual cyberprotection measures taken for safety reasons, it is essential to implement an ongoing cyber monitoring of ships in order to detect, react accordingly, and stop any incoming threat. In this paper, we explain the specific constraints when trying to assess the cyber situation awareness of maritime information systems. As we will demonstrate, those systems combine physical and logical constraints which complexify their cyber monitoring process and architecture. Gathering valuable data while having a limited and controlled impact on the satellite bandwidth, maintaining a high level of integrity on remote systems in production are, for instance, thriving challenges for both civilian and military ships. We have designed and set up a research platform which fulfils those specifications to streamline the cyber monitoring process. We will then describe the architecture used to detect cyber-threats and collect potential Indices of Compromise from naval systems, as well as the results we have currently achieved.","cyberprotection measures,satellite bandwidth,naval engineering,remote systems,Marine vehicles,Companies,security of data,cyber situation awareness,ships,marine engineering,information systems,military ships,maritime cybersecurity operations centre,Sea surface,Computer architecture,cyber monitoring process,maritime information systems,satellite links,maritime environment,cyberthreats,attack surface,naval systems,Computer security,Information systems,civilian ships,ICS-SOC-maritime-cyber situation awareness,"

"comparative analysis of positioning capability of beidou and gps in maritime islands","2022","After the full deployment of the Beidou-3 global satellite navigation system constellation, the positioning service range has been expanded from the Asia-Pacific region to the whole world. At present, most of the research on the positioning capability of Beidou system is on the mainland, and there is still room for research on the positioning capability of islands at sea. In this paper, the data of four IGS tracking stations distributed in islands are selected and solved by Anubis software. The visualization of Beidou and GPS is analyzed in five aspects: satellite visible number, standard single point positioning error, DOP value, signal-to-noise ratio, and multi-path effect. The results show that: (1) In the Asia-Pacific region, the positioning accuracy of Beidou's maritime islands is better than 0.734 m, 0.724 m, and 2.115 m in the N, E, and U directions, respectively, which is basically equivalent to GPS. Whereas, it is roughly 3 m, 3 m and 6 m lower than GPS outside the Asia-Pacific region, and the average number of visible satellites of Beidou in ANMG station and SOLO station is 15 and 11 respectively, which presumably means that the satellite density of Beidou system in the Asia-Pacific region is higher. (2) The average values of signal-to-noise ratio and multipath error of C22, C23, C24 and C25 stars of BeiDou are 41.638 dBHz and 0.574 m, respectively, which are basically comparable to those of G01, G02, G03 and G04 stars of GPS.

"an analysis of path loss models of lte-maritime for mobile communication system in maritime environments","2019","Mobile users in maritime environments have the limitation to use various data services due to insufficient communication infrastructure. Many communication systems commonly used for terrestrial users have been applied to maritime environments. The objective of this paper is to analyze the path loss characteristics of long term evolution (LTE) system and confirm its feasibility in maritime environments. In this purpose, we developed the test-bed for LTE-Maritime at coastline in the Republic of Korea and conducted onboard experiments for reference signal received power (RSRP) and throughput measurements. The measured RSRP values are compared with three conventional path loss models of free space path loss (FSPL), two ray (TR) path loss, Okumura-Hata (OH) model. The comparison results show that the existing models tend to underestimate the RSRP degradation suffered from maritime environment and there is a notable difference between the experiment data and path loss models. In order to analyze their accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE) for each model is calculated according to the distance between a transmitter and a receiver, and the results show that the expected error becomes high with increasing distance. In addition, the throughput measurements show that LTE can provide high-speed data services in the order of Mbps with the long communication distance up to 100 km.","long term evolution system,maritime,conventional path loss models,RMSE,Antenna measurements,Marine vehicles,Mathematical model,LTE,Sea measurements,size 100.0 km,LTE-maritime,mobile communication system,cellular radio,Data models,field measurement,root mean square error,mean square error methods,communication systems,maritime environment,Loss measurement,marine communication,ray path loss,Path loss,Long Term Evolution,path loss characteristics,free space path loss,"
"collaborative optimization scheduling of maritime communication for mobile edge architecture","2018","The rapid development of the land-based edge computing architecture has pushed the horizon of a new processing mode, which transfers the big data processing from the cloud to the edge side. In the contex of mobile edge computing, combined with the idea of collaborative cooperation, we put forward a maritime mobile collaborative edge communication model. A novelty of the model is the addition of a new level of collaborative edge as a small-type processing center between the cloud and the edge sides. For the sake of high efficiency in task scheduling of the collaborative edge part, we adopt an improved Cooperative Co-evolution Algorithm to overcome the constraints of marine environment and communication costs. In order to make the complex matters simplify, this paper adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy and transforms the scheduling optimization problem into the issue of seeking the best individual set of subpopulations.

"development and deployment of multi-mission intelligent autonomous maritime systems","2020","Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multi-mission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. â€œAutonomyâ€ is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.","research-only test units,Ocean Aero vehicles,Vehicle dynamics,operational value,autonomous navigation capabilities,mission progress monitoring,Cherokee Nation capabilities-based assessment process,UxS,remotely controlled information capture tools,Sensor systems,ocean surface,unmanned maritime systems,ground robot technologies,autonomy,terrestrial communications,maritime unmanned systems,onboard vehicle decision-making,command-and-control communication architecture,mission data transfer,satellite communication,multidomain communication systems,Testing,Vehicles,command-and-control,mission requirements,purpose-built systems,BVLOS,autonomous underwater vehicles,rugged missions,Sea surface,telecontrol,multimission intelligent autonomous maritime systems,testing team,data collection examples,CNSP,sensors,decision making,intelligent autonomy,persistent navigation capabilities,situational awareness,surface vehicle technologies,command and control systems,visual line of sight,path planning,mission management awareness,satellite communications,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,sample test cases,test and evaluation,unmanned systems,UXS,Visualization,customized mission-centric sensors,maritime domains,Tools,surface vehicles,operational mission scenarios,surface vehicle systems,remote operator control station,University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center,Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs,intelligent autonomous underwater vehicles,"

"desyco: a decision support system for the regional risk assessment of climate change impacts in coastal zones","2016","Several decision support systems were developed in recent years to encourage climate adaptation planning in coastal areas, especially at a national to global scale. However, few prototypes are easy to use and accessible for decision-makers to evaluate and manage risks locally. DESYCO is a GIS based decision support system specifically designed to better understand the risks that climate change poses at the regional/subnational scale (e.g. the effect of sea level rise and coastal erosion on human assets and ecosystems) and set the context of strategic adaptation planning within Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It implements a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowing the spatial assessment of multiple climate change impacts in coastal areas and the ranking of key elements at risk (beaches, wetlands, protected areas, urban and agricultural areas). The core of the system is a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model used to operationalize the steps of the RRA (hazard, exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage assessment) by integrating a blend of information from climate scenarios (global/regional climate projections and hydrodynamic/hydrological simulations) and from non-climate vulnerability factors (physical, environmental and socio-economic features of the analysed system). User-friendly interfaces simplify the interaction with the system, providing guidance for risk mapping, results communication and understanding. DESYCO was applied to low-lying coastal plains and islands (the North Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Gabes and the Republic of Mauritius), river basins and groundwater systems (Upper Plain of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche Region). The paper presents the RRA methodology, the structure of DESYCO and its software architecture, showing the capabilities of the tool to support decision making and climate proofing in a wide range of situations (e.g. shoreline planning, land use and water resource management, flood risk reduction).","Geographic information systems (GIS),Climate change adaptation,Decision support systems (DSS),Risk assessment,Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA),"
"green rf/fso communications in cognitive relay-based space information networks for maritime surveillance","2019","In this paper, we provide an overview of a space-based network for the maritime surveillance information sharing and evaluate the coverage, the throughput and the real-time reception capacity of the presented systems. The focus is on the feeder link of a multi-hop geostationary satellite system. We propose a cognitive relay-based architecture for the inter-satellite and satellite-to-ground communication with a multi-band spectrum sensing operating on both free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) bands. Furthermore, modeling the spectrum sensing energy as a Gamma distribution we derive the formula of the network energy consumption in presence of multipath fading and considering two different data relay schemes: amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). We prove that the RF/FSO communication in the proposed relay-based architecture enhances the data transmission increasing the throughput and the real-time reception capacity and reducing the network energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the DF scheme overcomes the AF one in terms of energy consumption while the AF scheme overcomes the DF one in terms of probability detection, both experience the same throughput. Finally, the proposed novel architecture has been compared with existing ones showing that it enhances the current maritime surveillance systems by jointly optimizing communication functionalities.","inter-satellite communication,surveillance,telecommunication power management,cognitive radio,real-time reception capacity,multi-hop networks,satellite systems,Marine vehicles,radio frequency free-space optical communications,cognitive relay-based networks,radio spectrum management,green RF/FSO communications,free-space optical communication,Satellite communication,detection probability,network energy consumption,marine engineering,optimisation,coverage evaluation,amplify-and-forward,multiband spectrum sensing,feeder link,decode-and-forward,maritime surveillance information sharing,space information networks,multihop geostationary satellite system,Spread spectrum communication,relay networks (telecommunication),decode and forward communication,data relay,satellite links,Maritime surveillance,signal detection,satellite-to-ground communication,Surveillance,throughput,RF/FSO communication,multipath fading,network energy,amplify and forward communication,oceanographic techniques,"
"nc-ofdm transceiver design for maritime cognitive radio","2018","High-speedand reliable connectivity for data communication is essential requirement, including in maritime environment.

"cyber risk perception in the maritime domain: a systematic literature review","2021","This paper aims to present an approach to investigate cyber risk perception with use of recognized psychological models, and to give an overview of state-of-the-art research within the field of cyber risk perception in general and in the context of the maritime domain. The focus will be on determinative dimensions within the psychometric paradigm and cognitive biases, and to give recommendations on further research within these fields. Okoli and Schabramâ€™s eight-step guide to plan, select, extract, and execute a systematic literature review is used as guidance. The search process resulted in 25 relevant articles which describes 24 dimensions of cyber risk perception in different online environments. Research within the area of maritime cyber security is increasing, however, no studies relevant for our literature review were found within the maritime domain. The nine dimensions in the psychometric model, perceived benefit and the optimistic bias is presented and discussed in a maritime context. Cyber risk perception is a complex research-area where both determinative factors and other cognitive processes can be influenced by each other. This can indicate that the dimensions differ across populations and professions, creating grounds for why context-specific studies are important. Further research may benefit from more multidisciplinary, descriptive, and inductive approaches, and contextual studies within maritime cyber risk perception can contribute to develop targeted tools for risk mitigation to enhance safety at sea.","risk perception,Safety,online environments,systematic literature review,maritime cyber risk perception,human behavior,security of data,human factors,psychology,Cyberspace,cognition,search process,Bibliographies,marine safety,psychological models,marine engineering,cognitive biases,project management,Computer crime,cognitive processes,maritime cyber security,cyberpsychology,risk analysis,Psychology,psychometric paradigm,Maritime cyber security,Tools,risk communication,Systematics,"
"a hybrid network for maritime on-board communications","2012","Current maritime on-board communications have to be enhanced for safety and security, where ubiquitous technologies can help, together with providing comfort and convenience to the crew and passengers. Employing wireless sensor networks on board is one recent practice of implementing ubiquitous technology for ships, where further study is needed because of the connectivity challenges. Meanwhile, it is important for an on-board communication system to be reliable and flexible for handling emergency situations. In this paper, we propose a solution of employing ubiquitous technology on ships in a way that both connectivity and emergency handling are examined. Two key aspects of this proposal are: 1) combine different on-board communication networks into a hybrid system, enabling the cooperation between them, 2) smoothly integrate these networks with a consideration of backward compatibility, ease of deployment and connection to shore via Internet. Simulations are used to support our choice between the separate networks and a hybrid one from comparing mainly the communication performance, and a combined integration approach is selected based on comprehensive analysis.","telecommunication security,backward compatibility,hybrid network approach,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,Wireless sensor networks,Mobile handsets,Wireless communication,combined integration approach,IP networks,ubiquitous computing,ships,maritime on-board communication system,wireless sensor networks,emergency handling,on-board communications,marine communication,Internet,ubiquitous technology,"
"robust broadband maritime communications: theoretical and experimental validation","2018","Atmospheric ducts, which are caused by the rapid decrease in the refractive index of the lower atmosphere, have been recognized as the dominant propagation mechanism for long range maritime links. Recent advances in radio technology are making reliable high-capacity overwater links a reality. A ray-tracing simulation model was developed to obtain reliable prediction of maritime link performance beyond 30 km for realistic conditions. A series of static and mobile long range maritime multiple-input multiple-output links were tested with representative antenna heights at 1.39 (Band 3 or L-Band) and 4.5 GHz (Band 4 or C-Band) during periods with various levels of ducting activities, for example, sunset and sunrise times. Measured link performance and observed ducting occurrences are compared to predictions to validate the model ability to accurately predict and explain link performance for various ducting conditions. The test results agree with the model predictions and illustrate the various Received Signal Level degradation, enhancement, and fluctuations that can be expected in long range maritime links below 6 GHz. We also report on short-term (few to several minutes) fluctuations of the received signal level at the two measurement frequency bands during high ducting activity periods. Measurements and theoretical analysis of the effect of ducting on the quality of maritime communication links indicate that both reflection-induced and ducting-induced disruptions are different and more frequent in higher-frequency bands. This work opens interesting perspectives on providing more robust and more predictable communications in the presence of ducting.","Sea measurements,Sea surface,Terrestrial atmosphere,Ocean temperature,Refractive index,Atmospheric modeling,Ducts,"

"an effective presentation of navigation information for prevention of maritime disaster using ais and 3d-gis","2013","We present a method for communicating navigation information that will assist operators to prevent maritime disaster. Although this topic has been extensively researched, the navigational situation of vessels has received little attention. However, such a navigational situation is essential for understanding water bodies and ensuring maritime safety. To provide effective navigation information, this study first analyzes the actual situation of vessel traffic using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Operators can be based on the analysis to understand the trend of navigation ships in water bodies as an important reference. From the results of the analysis, we constructed a representable navigational information system. Different information was unified on a Geographical Information System (GIS) in two-and three-dimensional formats. The system was demonstrated in a navigation simulation of a real voyage ship in Osaka Bay, Japan. The integrated information can be comprehensively and realistically interpreted by operators.

"security in iot-enabled digital twins of maritime transportation systems","2023","The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this modelâ€™s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the systemâ€™s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","telecommunication network reliability,telecommunication security,telecommunication power management,Maritime Transportation System,Transportation,secure maritime transportation,historical transportation data,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,intelligent maritime transportation,Marine vehicles,maritime transportation DTs model,data transmission paths,relay nodes,IoT-enabled digital twins,Radio frequency,Maritime Silk Road,digital twins,comprehensive operational security,outage probability analysis,Relays,digitalization,relay cooperation IoT,node secrecy rate,communication performance,wireless channels,safety performance,relay security analysis,system performance,system security performance,cooperative communication,probability,Digital Twins Internet,data transmission power,Sensors,relay cooperation,Digital twins,Security,maritime transportation system,maritime silk road,"

"3-d multiobjective deployment of an industrial wireless sensor network for maritime applications utilizing a distributed parallel algorithm","2018","Effectively monitoring maritime environments has become a vital problem in maritime applications. Traditional methods are not only expensive and time consuming but also restricted in both time and space. More recently, the concept of an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) has become a promising alternative for monitoring next-generation intelligent maritime grids, because IWSNs are cost-effective and easy to deploy. This paper focuses on solving the issue of 3-D IWSN deployment in a 3-D engine room space of a very large crude-oil carrier and also considers numerous power facilities. To address this 3-D IWSN deployment problem for maritime applications, a 3-D uncertain coverage model is proposed that uses a modified 3-D sensing model and an uncertain fusion operator. The deployment problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses three objectives: coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Our goal is to achieve extensive coverage, long network lifetime, and high reliability. We also propose a distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm for maritime applications. We verify the effectiveness of this algorithm through experiments by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs most effectively both in optimization performance and in minimizing the computation time.","distributed parallel algorithm,wireless sensor network deployment,evolutionary computation,Wireless sensor networks,3-D engine room,3-D sensing model,distributed parallel cooperative coevolutionary multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithm,wireless sensor networks,Three-dimensional displays,maritime environments,very large crude-oil carrier (VLCC),parallel algorithms,industrial wireless sensor network,maritime applications,multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA),3D multiobjective deployment,multiobjective optimization problem,Optimization,IWSN,next-generation intelligent maritime grids,marine communication,Algorithm design and analysis,Sensors,3-D engine room space,long network lifetime,Evolutionary computation,3-D uncertain coverage model,cooperative systems,"
"distributed adaptive time slot allocation for wimax based maritime wireless mesh networks","2009","We envisage extending radio coverage of the existing terrestrial wireless broadband networks to the sea to provide ships with cost-efficient high-speed connection to the Internet. This is achieved by forming a WiMAX based maritime wireless mesh network where ships are network nodes connected to the land station across multiple hops. In such a maritime wireless mesh network, time slot allocation is an important issue as it affects the performance in terms of throughout and delay. This papers proposes a distributed adaptive time slot allocation (DATSA) scheme for WiMAX mesh MAC protocol. DATSA is a distributed scheme that allocates time slots robustly by taking into consideration difference between radio reception range and interference range, and latency in scheduling control messages. DATSA has a method to monitor reception quality of an allocated time slot, in order to detect the effect of topology changes due to ship mobility, etc. Based on the monitoring outcome, the method adaptively changes the time slot allocation if necessary. We have evaluated DATSA through random event simulation using QualNet. The simulation results confirm that DATSA outperforms the original WiMAX mesh MAC protocol that has no adaptive time slot allocation, in terms of throughput, average packet delay, and packet delivery ratio.","WiMAX mesh MAC protocol,terrestrial wireless broadband network,Robust control,Wireless mesh networks,Marine vehicles,Monitoring,distributed adaptive time slot allocation,radio reception range,IP networks,interference range,maritime wireless mesh network,ship mobility,access protocols,telecommunication network topology,Delay effects,Media Access Protocol,Broadband communication,radiofrequency interference,broadband networks,radio reception,marine communication,WiMAX,Interference,Internet,WiMax,"
"biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme for maritime cognitive radio networks","2018","Spectrum sensing is imperative to the success of maritime cognitive radio networks (MCRNs). Spectrum sensing in MCRNs is challenging because of the sea surface movement, the channel interference, and the unstable link quality. Recent research reveals that existing spectrum sensing schemes work well for lower sea states; however, they have failed to perform effectively at higher sea states. There are two disadvantages of performing spectrum sensing at higher sea states: 1) low probability of detection may also cause interference with primary system and 2) energy wastage. In this paper, a biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme (BIC3S) is proposed to deal with the reliability and energy consumption challenges associated with the sea environment. It is based on the task allocation model of an insect colony. The proposed BIC3S chooses participating secondary users for cooperative spectrum sensing according to their given sea state. Further, it enables the secondary users to decide whether or not to perform spectrum sensing based on their sea state. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of energy consumption, detection performance, and throughput. It is shown that the proposed BIC3S consumes less energy and, at the same time, achieves higher detection probability and fewer probability of false alarms compared to the existing schemes. Moreover, BIC3S provides better adaptation capabilities for the sea environment.","telecommunication network reliability,cooperative detection,cognitive radio,BIC3S,Cognitive radio network,maritime cognitive radio networks,Marine vehicles,channel interference,energy wastage,radio spectrum management,Wireless communication,task allocation model,higher sea states,unstable link quality,detection probability,low probability-of-detection,sea surface movement,sea environment,biologically inspired cooperative spectrum sensing scheme,Entropy,Sea state,radio networks,maritime communication,detection performance,Biology,insect colony,cooperative communication,signal detection,probability,energy consumption,marine communication,MCRN,spectrum sensing,Detectors,"
"beam scheduling of maritime multifunctional radar based on binary integration","2023","This study developed a radar resource management (RRM) framework for maritime multifunctional radar (MFR) that performs surveillance and tracking of unknown targets. The proposed scheme consists of two stages: target prioritization based on fuzzy logic and a beam scheduling approach that transmits surveillance beam and tracking beams for each target appropriately. The proposed beam scheduling scheme also takes into account the imperfect detection of targets in real situation. A conventional heuristic beam scheduling approach was modified to incorporate binary integration in radar theory into the RRM strategy. The resulting scheme efficiently handles the complicated beam scheduling problem by considering the target priority as well as the imperfect detection of targets of a real maritime MFR.

"precise localization for achieving next-generation autonomous navigation: state-of-the-art, taxonomy and future prospects","2020","Achieving full autonomy in navigation is a complicated problem. The most widely used solution takes up the modular framework for sensing and information processing such as perception, mapping, control, planning and decision making. However, this approach misses the capability of environmental understanding. Hence, to achieve full autonomy in navigation a computing model with self-learning capability inspired by biological intelligence such as memorizing, inferring and experience update is essential for dynamic and noisy environments. Recent advanced sensing, communication and hardware miniaturization technologies achieved few autonomous operations in commercial systems but the full autonomy has not been attained yet. In this paper, the effect of precise and accurate localization for autonomous navigation technologies is extensively studied and the problems and limitations of the related algorithms are analyzed. The major limitations for precise localization are computational complexity, sensor noise and communication delays. These limitations further reduce perception and planning capabilities of autonomous navigation systems. From this study, the future prospects are outlined to achieve a higher level of autonomy by precise localization.","Sensor fusion,Autonomous system,AUV,Network localization,Autonomous mobile robots,Navigation,Localization,Perception,Micro air vehicle,Mapping,UAV,Sensing,"

"fuzzy/human risk analysis for maritime situational awareness and decision support","2017","Human computation (HC) is an active research field in which people play a notable role as computational elements in an automated system with the aim of arriving at a truly symbiotic human-computer interaction. Situational awareness (SA) and decision support systems (DSSs) are two domains where human computation is rapidly advancing, with the latter arising as an invaluable vehicle to achieve the former. Fuzzy systems and fuzzy logic are two commonly employed tools in these domains due to their inherent capabilities of representing and processing vague and imprecise information while conveying the analysis results in an interpretable fashion. In this paper, we elaborate on the human computation aspects of risk analysis within SA and DSS conducted with the aid of fuzzy sets.

"a systematic literature review on rams analysis for critical infrastructures protection","2021","Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety/Security (RAMS) analysis of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) can be applied to investigate their performance subjected to failure modes. The literature has witnessed earlier research approaches to RAM analysis. However, the integration of cybersecurity or safety aspects, along with the RAM to develop RAMS analysis methods, tools, and models, is a significant aspect for protecting CIs as their digitalization is progressing. In recent times, digital components and systems comprising information and communication technologies, smart devices, efficient gateways, faster protocols have transformed the CIs. This transformation comes with a considerable cost, such as the necessity to integrate innovative cyber-defense measures and policies due to new vulnerabilities, efficient maintenance strategies, risk management scenario development, resilience with self-healing architecture. Nevertheless, the current knowledge body lacks an up-to-date Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focused on addressing integrated protection aspects, recent developments, and evaluation criteria towards RAMS analysis for CIs. Accordingly, this study aims to provide a comprehensive SLR on existing studies dealing with developing techniques, methodologies, protocols, models, and RAMS analysis tools for different applications. This SLR followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. 1513 records published between 2011 and 2020 are initially identified, which are later screened to 212 records to be considered for the eligibility check process. Finally, after examining the exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 19 articles are included in this research. In this SLR, a comparative analysis of existing solutions based on included studies is presented in different aspects such as developed architectures and methodologies, performance evaluation mechanisms, implementation scenarios, targeted applications, pros and cons, and applied CIs protection aspects associated with RAMS. The findings suggest that RAMS analysis for CIs is an emerging research area, with currently focused applications including power grid stations, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud computing, maritime transportation, and Industrial Control Systems. 36.8% of the studies have performed a real-time implementation, while the remaining approaches have either performed simulation or preliminary analysis.

"an efficient identity-based aggregate signcryption scheme with blockchain for iot-enabled maritime transportation system","2022","Maritime transportation has ushered in a period of vigorous development and has been the most critical mode of transport in international trade.

This trend needs the IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation System (IMTS) to enhance its ability of privacy-preserving, performance continuously, and add the function of joint management. Although many aggregate signcryption (ASC) schemes have been presented to satisfy this requirement, they still suffer from performance deficiencies or security weaknesses. To address these issues, we design a more practical â€œPerception-Network-Applicationâ€ IoT-enabled MTS (PNA-IMTS) network structure.

"dynamic selection scheme of lte-m and 5g for efficient maritime communication based on traffic volume","2023","This paper investigates the technology for selecting communication scheme based on the amount of traffic in LTE-M (Marine) and 5G communication environments. Recently, it has been possible to use LTE-M and 5G communications for preventing collisions between ships and obstacles in coastal areas, moving from a focus on terrestrial users. This paper proposes a scheme for efficiently handling both small-scale and large-volume traffic generated from terminals on ships. LTE-M can accommodate more terminals by utilizing the wide coverage of coastal areas, but it can be vulnerable to high-volume video processing for real-time obstacle detection. 5G provides a high data transmission rate and low latency, making it suitable for large data exchanges between ships or real-time services, but its short coverage makes it unsuitable for accommodating a wide area. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme for dynamically selecting LTE-M or 5G communication schemes according to the amount of data generated by terminals on ships, to transmit data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to decide which communication scheme, LTE-M or 5G, should be chosen based on the amount and type of traffic. The algorithm dynamically selects the optimal communication scheme considering real-time traffic information and network status. By implementing a simulation environment for coastal areas using the technique proposed in this paper, we compare the scheme where terminals installed on ships selectively use LTE-M and 5G communication schemes with the scheme where two communication schemes are chosen randomly for transmission. The simulation results confirm that the proposed technique can process more data compared to the existing schemes.","Streaming media,Sea measurements,5G Communication Technology,Multi-Sensor Based Systems,5G mobile communication,Base stations,Heuristic algorithms,Fire Detection and Evacuation,Telecommunication traffic,System performance,"

It is of great significance to build a secure and efficient maritime transportation system (MTS). The introduction of Internet of things technology makes MTS more perfect. The IoT-enabled MTS is composed of marine terminals and on-board sensors, land-based data centers and base stations, as well as satellite networks. Many researchers have carried out significant work to aggregate data in MTS. However, because the terrestrial base stations cannot cover most of the sea area, the isolated maritime terminals, those who drive to the area without base station coverage, need the assistance of satellite networks to complete the contact with the data center.

In addition, on-board sensors are introduced in the system to help aggregate the status and surrounding environment of the maritime terminal.

Specifically, an energy-limited delay tolerant networking (DTN) node deployed in the ocean receives/transmits data from/to vessels within its communication range. To further save the energy, a long-term energy minimization problem is formulated with sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission.

"a multicriteria model for personnel selection in maritime industry in greece","2017","The quality of staff is of paramount importance in all businesses. However, in maritime industry it is crucial due to the nature of the business itself. Employees' lives could be exposed to risk, let alone that huge assets are in stake, if poor decisions are made. Employing quality and professional human resources requires a personnel selection process that would evaluate the best suited personnel, dealing with the consideration of both qualitative and quantitative criteria. However, despite the significance of the maritime industry worldwide, research is needed in order to investigate the criteria upon which maritime management could rely when selecting their human resources. This paper aims at developing a multi-criteria model for personnel selection in the maritime industry, based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), chosen for its ability to incorporate multiple subjective opinions into a solid decision model. A novel criteria ranking technique based on Correspondence Analysis (CA) was added to the process in order to select the most highly evaluated criteria through a powerful data-driven method which does not rely on a-priori scales. Data was collected by interviewing experts from 14 maritime companies in Greece. The resulting model was validated by comparing its results against previous cases of successful employment. The results indicate that criteria such as trustworthiness, responsibility, capabilities in decision making, team spirit and communication skills are among the most important traits that companies look for.","analytic hierarchy process,multicriteria selection model,qualitative criteria,criteria ranking technique,data-driven method,Correspondence Analysis,Personnel,Industries,Companies,human resource management,solid decision model,personnel selection,Maritime industry,Analytic hierarchy process,correspondence analysis,data collection,professional human resources,personnel,Greece,Analytic Hierarchy Process,quantitative criteria,AHP,maritime industry,maritime management,personnel selection process,multicriteria model,Analytical models,"
"uav assistance paradigm: state-of-the-art in applications and challenges","2020","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging technology with the potential to be used in industries and various sectors of human life to provide a wide range of applications and services. During the last decade, there has been a growing focus of research in the UAV's assistance paradigm as a fundamental concept resulting in the constant improvement between different kinds of ground networks and the hovering UAVs in the sky. Recently, the wide availability of embedded wireless interfaces in the communicating entities has allowed the deployment of such a paradigm simpler and easiest. Moreover, due to UAVs' controlled mobility and adjustable altitudes, they can be considered as the most appropriate candidate to enhance the performance and overcome the restrictions of ground networks. This comprehensive survey both studies and summarizes the existing UAV-assisted research, such as routing, data gathering, cellular communications, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and disaster management that supports existing enabling technologies. Descriptions, classifications, and comparative studies related to different UAV-assisted proposals are presented throughout the paper. By pointing out numerous future challenges, it is expected to simulate research in this emerging and hot research area. To the best of our knowledge, there are many survey papers on the topic from a technology perspective. Nevertheless, this survey can be considered as the first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of different types of existing UAV-assisted networks and describes the state-of-the-art in UAV-assisted research.","Routing,IoT,Cellular communications,Fog computing,UAV,Data gathering,"
"energy-efficient trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2022","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAVâ€™s energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAVâ€™s flight trajectory subject to wind effect. The conventional successive convex approximation (SCA) method can provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered wind effect, while the computational/trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework with tailored initialization algorithm that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently, as well as a hybrid offline-online (HO2) design that leverages convex stochastic programming (CSP) offline based on wind statistics, and refines the solution by adapting online to real-time wind velocity. Numerical results show that our optimized trajectory can better adapt to various setups with different target data volume and buoysâ€™ topology as well as various wind speed/direction/variance compared with benchmark schemes. In particular, our proposed HO2 design can effectively adapt to random wind variations with feasible and robust online operation, and proactively exploit the wind for further energy savings in both single-buoy and multi-buoy scenarios.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind statistics,wind effect,aircraft power systems,successive convex approximation,Energy consumption,SCA,convex programming,energy-efficient trajectory design,control engineering computing,hybrid offline-online design,trajectory complexity,Wireless communication,flight trajectory,data acquisition,single-buoy scenarios,real-time wind velocity,target data volume,communication time scheduling,oceanic exploration,UAV-aided maritime data collection system,Maritime data collection,HO2 design,random wind variations,hybrid offline-online (HO2),trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,wind direction,energy savings,marine buoys,convex stochastic programming,Real-time systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,wind speed,wind,trajectory control,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,mobile robots,energy conservation,sub-optimal solutions,stochastic programming (SP),aerospace computing,Task analysis,multibuoy scenarios,Data collection,approximation theory,stochastic programming,fixed-wing UAV,CSP,"
"analysis of a sub-ghz-band diffraction propagation model for maritime application","2021","In this paper, a low-power wide-area wireless system is used to obtain an appropriate model for sub-GHz-band radio propagation diffraction loss in a multi-island area to compare with actual measurements. For the radio propagation in the multi-island sea discussed in this paper, the contour of the obstacle is clear because the obstacle island is surrounded by a horizontal sea surface. As a result, the Bullington method, which assumes a virtual peak at the intersection of the two ends of the obstacle, is found to be suitable. The results also show that the multi-island sea area has an advantage in improving the accuracy of modeling because the criteria for determining isolated obstacles are easy to determine.","Maritime Propagation,maritime application,Shape measurement,Propagation by Diffraction,Solid modeling,Wireless communication,horizontal sea surface,Bullington method,diffraction propagation model,Diffraction,electromagnetic wave diffraction,radiowave propagation,multiisland sea area,Shape,Sea surface,wide-area wireless system,Low-power Wide-area System,Multiple Knife-Edge Diffraction Model,subGHz-band radio propagation diffraction loss model,marine communication,obstacle island,low-power wide-area wireless system,Analytical models,"
"an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station by a ray-based monte carlo method","2017","In this paper, an analysis of maritime communications between a ship at sea and a shore station using a ray-based Monte Carlo method has been proposed. A sea surface is modeled by the one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. A Monte Carlo method based on a ray tracing is employed to predict the scattering from the temporally evolving rough sea surface for each time step. The maximum of double reflections is restricted in the ray tracing for a practical purpose. The total received signal is the superposition of the direct propagating field and the scattered field by the sea surface. The statistical numerical result is finally obtained by averaging the results from many realizations. Numerical results for the link performance evaluation obtained by the proposed method are illustrated. The results show that the misalignment of transmitting and receiving antennas due to the rolling ship has relatively less impact on the communication link performance than the multipath fading due to the scattering by the temporally evolving rough sea surface.","direct propagating field,Monte Carlo methods,ray tracing,receiving antennas,scattered field,electromagnetic wave propagation,Marine vehicles,Rough surfaces,Transmitting antennas,Scattering,ships,ransmitting antennas,rough sea surface,one-side Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum,Sea surface,Monte Carlo method,transmitting antennas,statistical numerical result,Receiving antennas,communication link performance,Surface roughness,marine communication,shore station,electromagnetic wave scattering,maritime communications,"

In this paper, the concept of multi-AUV-based UWNs is first defined, where AUV is regarded as a network node, and communication among the AUVs is the potential network links. Then, to improve network scalability and controllability, a paradigm of Software Defined multi-AUV-based UWNs (SD-UWNs) is proposed, where the Software Defined Network (SDN) technique is used to upgrade the UWN architecture by directing intelligent network functions. Topology and artificial potential field theories are applied to construct a network control model for the SD-UWNs. Based on the efficient data sharing ability of the SD-UWNs, an early warning obstacle avoidance-enabled path planning scheme is proposed to guarantee safe sailing of the SD-UWNs, where comprehensive obstacle avoidance scenarios are taken into account.

"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FedBatch.","Maritime Transportation System,CNN-MLP based model,computer network security,federated learning process,IoT,Collaborative work,deep learning (artificial intelligence),serious cyber security threats,maritime transportation systems,Internet of Things,cloud,security of data,multifarious cyber-attacks,privacy preservation,Maritime Transportation systems,deep learning,Servers,lightweight local model,model training local,Data models,massive data,network intrusion,voyage,edge computing,federated learning,IoT-based MTS,adaptive aggregation method,multilayer perceptrons,convolutional neural nets,model parameters,Training,Convolutional neural networks,Intrusion detection,Intrusion Detection System,named Batch Federated Aggregation,IoT devices,learning (artificial intelligence),data privacy,global model,"
"enhanced sismaris: (systã¨me d'information et de surveillance maritime etendu pour l'identification des comportements suspects): enhanced maritime surveillance and information system for abnormal behaviour identification","2010","The number of ships and the diversity of threat in maritime surveillance increase every day. Tracking and monitoring from the coast all type of ship on a common operational picture is no more sufficient. An Innovative solution shall be set up to support human operators in their permanent surveillance tasks in vulnerable trading lanes and zones in order to detect abnormal or illicit vessel behaviour and to understand and to early identify threatening situations. Displaying thousands of tracks on a single display has be demonstrated its inefficiency, in front of all the cases of illegal immigration, terrorism, drugs trafficking, smuggling, illegal fishing, pollution, etc... that were recorded this year. This future generation of maritime surveillance system must allow: 1) Permanent and all weather coverage of border maritime areas. 2) Continuous collection and fusion of heterogeneous data provided by various types of sensors deployed on coast and on mobile platforms and other information from external sources. 3) Supervised automatic detection of abnormal vessel behaviours (in track and performed activity) and generate justified alarms. 4) Understanding of suspicious events and early identification of threats from series of detected spatiotemporal abnormal vessel behaviours (alarms). 5) Generate electronic and formatted interpretation reports on the suspicious event to keep periodically informed decisional authorities. 6) Anticipate the operational response mobilizing and using means with the best efficiency as possible 7) To capitalize knowledge and work of each partner, within an inter-agencies and international framework, for a common benefit on a real time basis 8) To ensure the data protection respecting the respective rules of information sharing.

However, in the horizon of 2015 significant technical progresses will be made in wide maritime area coverage detection and highlighting abnormal behaviors methodology that could be usefully used together to built up an new generation of sea border surveillance integrated system for efficient security applications in high density traffics. The objectives of the SISMARIS project are: 1) To build up a complete test system (end to end information acquisition and processing system). 2) To test new maritime surveillance sensors and other available intelligent information sources in order to obtain optimal maritime security awareness. 3) To demonstrate that this new information system will help the operator to analyze automatically a high density of tracks in order to highlight only the useful information, and detect some predefined behavior that could be abnormal or not. 4) To give the police authorities a helpful tool to collect and register evidences in order to prosecute usefully offenders. The objectives of the ESISMARIS project are to extend the coverage of detection of SISMARIS by including Satellite AIS across North Atlantic Ocean, and to evaluate a new innovative solution in the fight against drugs transfer between Central America and Europe.

We evaluate the maximum range that can be supported for different reliability requirements and we focus specifically on analyzing the gain that can be obtained when antenna height and/or band diversity are used. It was found that for high reliability requirements, the antenna height at the shore is the main factor on deciding the maximum communication range that can be maintained.

"common vocabulary set for support of interoperability of data contents of maritime equipment and systems in e-navigation services","2016","In the maritime field, e-navigation, the new maritime service environment paradigm, is a topic of wide discussion. According to the e-navigation concept, the various marine and marine-related domains' data both on- and off-shore are used as resources for maritime services, the purpose of which are to facilitate communication at sea and to ensure safe navigation. To those ends, e-navigation services exchange, share, and utilize data resources created and distributed according to the data product specifications based on the e-navigation Common Maritime Data Structure (CMDS). Currently, maritime equipment and systems transfer data among themselves over ships' networks. In e-navigation, those equipment and systems' data will be utilized as useful data resources. But before that data can be used, it is necessary to create and distribute it according to the above-noted CMDS-based data product specifications. When a data product specification is developed for a specific domain, a common vocabulary for that domain is needed for consistent specification of the data elements that represent the data contents.

"sea fog attenuation analysis of white-led light sources for maritime vlc","2019","Maritime VLC has features of high speed, low cost and anti-EMI. The scattering attenuation of sea fog particles for white-LED light source will directly affect the signal transmission. Due to meteorological effects, much physical detail could be lost in Maritime VLC. Effects of changes in the particle size distributions and influences of different sources cannot easily be taken into account. To address this issue, this paper presents scattering spectrum analysis of sea fog particles and attenuation of maritime VLC channel systematically. Firstly, based on sea fog parameters, the scattering, extinction and phase functions of sea fog particles can be calculated by employing Mie theory. Furthermore, scattering analysis of sea fog particle swarm could be evaluated. Then transmission attenuation of wide spectrum white-LED is analyzed by utilizing revised Gamma distribution. According to the sensitivity of the receiver detector in visible light band, the change of white light transmission spectrum is weighted. At last, combined with the white LED spectrum collected by the experiment, simulations describe that spectrum changes of white LED are obtained after transmission for a certain distance.","visible light band,receiver detector,particle size,particle size distributions,scattering functions,Absorption,sea fog particles,light emitting diodes,Gamma distribution,antiEMI,Mie theory,scattering analysis,scattering attenuation,scatting,optical links,fog sea,meteorological effects,fog,signal transmission,Atmospheric modeling,Scattering,free-space optical communication,Attenuation,scattering spectrum analysis,extinction functions,light attenuation,maritime VLC channel,sea fog particle swarm,Particle swarm optimization,Mie scattering,Atmospheric measurements,sea fog attenuation analysis,electromagnetic interference,underwater optical wireless communication,maritime transmission,light transmission,white LED spectrum,white light transmission spectrum,sea fog parameters,wide spectrum white-LED,transmission attenuation,white-LED light source,phase functions,Light emitting diodes,wide spectrum,"

"energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2020","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAVaided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV's energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory subject to wind effect, which is a non-convex problem and difficult to solve optimally. Existing techniques such as the successive convex approximation (SCA) method provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on the trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered the wind effect, while the computational complexity and resulted trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently subject to wind effect. Specifically, the proposed UAV trajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible for collecting only a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the computational/trajectory complexity, which allows searching for better trajectory initialization that fits the buoys' topology and the wind. Numerical results show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the benchmark oneflight-only scheme in general. Moreover, the optimized cyclical 8-shape trajectory can proactively exploit the wind and achieve lower energy consumption compared with the case without wind.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind effect,energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design,convex approximation,Energy consumption,convex programming,Acceleration,scheduling,nonconvex problem,communication time scheduling,UAV trajectory,oceanic exploration,8-shape trajectory,Maritime data collection,data volume,trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,strong winds,UAV energy consumption,marine buoys,UAV-aided maritime data collection,autonomous aerial vehicles,nonlinear programming,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,multiple cyclical laps,sub-optimal solutions,Task analysis,UAV flight trajectory subject,Data collection,approximation theory,fixed-wing UAV,energy efficiency,"

"interference range analysis and scheduling among three-hop neighborhood in maritime wimax mesh networks","2010","There is a lack of high-speed and low-cost wireless network at sea to meet the increasing need of maritime users. With this observation, we have envisaged a WiMAX mesh network for high-speed ship-to-ship/shore communications.

"detecting sophisticated attacks in maritime environments using hybrid situational awareness","2019","In recent years, the growing emergence of digitalization and data explosion has altered the threat dynamics in the maritime sector. The interconnected Maritime Critical Infrastructures are highly attracted by cybercriminals, who are constantly evolving their tactics, committing complex, sophisticated attacks causing a tremendous impact to economic and social life.

"use of noma for maritime communication networks with p-df relaying channel","2020","In this paper, a partial de-code-and-forward (P-DF) cooperative relaying network (CRN) with non-orthogonal multiple access (P-DF-CRN-NOMA) for maritime space communications is proposed. Without loss of generality, three kinds of relay forwarding protocols are studied to characterize the superiority of the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme, where, after receptions from the coastal base station (BS), the island relay forwards the successful decoded symbols to the ship user to avoid the performance loss provided by the high decoding requirement in decode-and-forward (DF). To further improve the system performance, as well as for a fairness comparison, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) is utilized at the ship user. Specifically, to present the impact of the channel qualities, the scenarios of the weak and strong links that from the source to destination (S-D) are both considered. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the P-DF-CRN-NOMA are derived considering the three proposed forwarding cases. Qualitative numerical results corroborating our theoretical analysis, especially for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), show that the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme significantly improves the outage probability performance in comparison to the conventional CRN-NOMA schemes.

"automatic gain control for asm channel in maritime communication","2015","This paper presents Automatic Gain Control (AGC) algorithm in maritime communication system using application specific message (ASM). In maritime communication, gain control is not easy than land mobile communication. Received signal is converted to digital signal by analog to digital converter (ADC). If the signal input power of ADC is smaller than adequate power then quantization noise increases. On the contrary, if the signal input power of ADC is large than adequate power then the output signal of ADC is saturated. This paper proposes essential algorithm that controls gain value effectively in case that received signal power and propagation delay are unknown. We first analyze the general method of AGC in maritime communication. The analysis will show that the time for gain convergence is needed and much longer than known case because the distance from transmitting ship to receiving ship is randomly distributed and unknown in each slot. The difference of gain values in each slot is as large as 100dB in maximum case. The larger a difference of gain values is, the longer gain convergence time is. This is because that any ship can transmit in any slot randomly, therefore, received signal power is not expectable. We show how proposed algorithm can effectively control the gain value in maritime communication environments. Result of simulation shows that the utilization of proposed algorithm can calculate the optimal gain value and regenerate optimal signal that is similar with original source. As a result, proposed AGC algorithm changes all gain values of total received signal into same gain value using back gain compensation. Especially, the gain value of received signal should be controlled in adequate because transmission randomly occurs in each slot in maritime communication. Proposed automatic gain control algorithm is essential and effective for stable demodulation performance in ASM maritime communication.","ASM channel,auto gain control,analog to digital converter,Gain control,Marine vehicles,Delays,Propagation delay,automatic gain control algorithm,Hardware,AIS,gain compensation,analogue-digital conversion,maritime communication,application specific message,ADC,AGC algorithm,automatic gain control,marine communication,Algorithm design and analysis,re-scaling,ASM,Demodulation,"

"tiny ir maritime object detection on the sea surface by colorful noise cancellation","2020","For IR maritime object recognition and surveillance in maritime communication administration, it's very important to recognize tiny objects because they are influenced by white Gaussian noise and colorful noise, especially by the wave and tide because of they can make strong noise and interfere recognition heavily. In fact, they are a kind of colorful noises. In this paper, the algorithm based on noise cancellation to strengthen tiny object recognition is proposed. In this method, the sea surface IR noise distribution is researched and mathematical model is constructed, the colorful noise processed to be weak by noise cancellation. This algorithm can detect tiny maritime object on the sea surface effectively, and is useful in night object detection and recognition.

"security analysis of drones systems: attacks, limitations, and recommendations","2020","Recently, the world witnessed a significant increase in the number of used drones, with a global and continuous rise in the demand for their multi-purpose applications. The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people’s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird’s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.","Drones security,Terrorism/counter-Terrorism,Drones security countermeasures techniques,Drones threats and vulnerabilities,Drones forensics,Drone/UAV warfare,UAS,Drones attacks,UAV,UUV,Armed drones,"
"maritime search and rescue based on group mobile computing for unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned surface vehicles","2020","Accidents often occur at sea, so effective maritime search and rescue is essential. In the current process of sea search and rescue, the operation efficiency of large search and rescue equipment is low and it cannot provide stable communication link. In this article, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are used to form a cognitive mobile computing network for co-operative search and rescue, and reinforcement learning (RL) is used to plan search path and improve communication throughput. Based on the scene of marine search and rescue, the grid method is used to model the search and rescue area. Meanwhile, an intragroup communication architecture based on UAVs and USVs is designed to assist intragroup communication by recognizing the link channel state between UAVs. Search and rescue path planning is carried out through the strategy iteration of Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, distributed RL is used to recognize the channel state and perform mobile computing, so as to optimize the data throughput in the communication group. The simulation results show that we have successfully completed the path planning task. Compared with conventional methods, RL based on different reward functions has better throughput performance under the same number of UAVs auxiliary communications.","Markov processes,Path planning,unmanned aerial vehicles,cognitive mobile computing network,path planning task,Throughput,group mobile computing,Mobile computing,sea search,search path,markov decision process,Learning (artificial intelligence),mobile computing,maritime search,Sea surface,distributed reinforcement learning,reinforcement learning,robot programming,autonomous aerial vehicles,path planning,unmanned surface vehicles,marine search,mobile robots,Data throughput,Computational modeling,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),Markov decision process,UAVs,"
"intelligent multi-aug ocean data collection scheme in maritime wireless communication network","2022","The new generation of wireless networks is strengthening ocean development capabilities. The deep-sea detection ability of the offshore platform is being improved by Ocean Internet of Everything (OIoE) system formed by various equipment. This paper studies the application of a new generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) wireless communication technology in marine monitoring platforms. The purpose is to solve the problem of high data redundancy and high energy consumption in multi-Automatic Underwater Glider (AUG) monitoring. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a matrix completion-based Sampling Points Selection joint Multi-AUG Path Planning (SPS-MAPP) scheme, which includes AUGs path planning and collection information matrix completion. In parts of AUGs path planning, the SPS-MAPP designed a multi-AUG trajectory optimization method using intermittent satellite communication. It proposes a reinforcement learning reward rule based on the idea of artificial potential field, which can effectively increase the coverage of AUGs trajectory. In parts of information processing, the SPS-MAPP proposes a 3-D matrix completion method, which searches for key nodes and edge nodes by designing regular sample points and operators to recover the entire space information.

"detection of ais messages falsifications and spoofing by checking messages compliance with tdma protocol","2023","Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information. It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Spoofing detection,TDMA protocol,Falsifications detection,Kalman filtering,"
"chapter 5 - food defense","2018","Governments and food manufacturers must consider the possibility that disgruntled individuals, criminals, terrorists, and other antisocial groups may intentionally contaminate food and threaten the safety of the agrifood chain. Also the number of economically motivated acts of intentional food adulteration is on the rise. As unintentional outbreaks of foodborne disease may severely harm sensitive consumers and because food trade is highly interconnected, an attack on one country’s food supply can have global personal, social, economic, and political impacts. Therefore, nations and food producers must take responsibility in protecting the agrifood chain against malicious and economically motivated acts of food tampering. Reducing the likeliness of deliberate contamination of agriculture and food products requires the implementation of food defense strategies. Food defense aims to mitigate the risks and hazards of intentional contamination in food operations by introducing a selection of countermeasures to make vulnerable elements in the agrifood chain/food operation more secure. However, although food defense builds barriers around vulnerable points to prohibit intentional adulteration, it cannot prevent it. Therefore, there is a need for a sensitive surveillance system to detect acts of intentional food contamination quickly, an alert system to recognize an incident involving food, and a program that must prepare the operation in responding to assaults of intentional food contamination. Response includes all measures to quickly and efficiently identify, contain, and minimize the impact of an intentional food contamination incident (e.g., by recall of suspected products), and to allow the food producer to recover and regain normal production levels. Preparedness also includes being trained in adequate risk and crisis communication, as it is what makes a public outrage different from a collaboration when addressing a food defense incident. This book chapter provides guidance to the food industry and public authorities for preventing and tackling intentional acts of food contamination.","food contamination,agroterrorism,chemical agents,foodborne disease,biological agents,food terrorism,"
"a proactive system for maritime environment monitoring","2016","The ability to remotely detect and monitor oil spills is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products. Indeed, shipping routes are becoming very crowded and the likelihood of oil slick occurrence is increasing. In this frame, a fully integrated remote sensing system can be a valuable monitoring tool. We propose an integrated and interoperable system able to monitor ship traffic and marine operators, using sensing capabilities from a variety of electronic sensors, along with geo-positioning tools, and through a communication infrastructure. Our system is capable of transferring heterogeneous data, freely and seamlessly, between different elements of the information system (and their users) in a consistent and usable form. The system also integrates a collection of decision support services providing proactive functionalities. Such services demonstrate the potentiality of the system in facilitating dynamic links among different data, models and actors, as indicated by the performed field tests.","Marine Information Systems,Real-time monitoring,Oil spill monitoring,Proactive environmental services,Environmental Decision Support Systems,"
"data privacy protection for maritime mobile terminals","2021","Mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively support various high reliability and low delay maritime applications, but security risks in computing tasks offloading exist. We describe a maritime network (MN) model based on MEC, and analyze the risk of data privacy leakage of maritime mobile terminal (MMT) during the offloading tasks. For abnormal maritime monitoring data (MMD), a data cleaning algorithm of sample density-based local outlier factor (SD-LOF) is proposed. It can effectively save the cost of data privacy protection (DPP) and improve the quality of MEC service. For data privacy leakage of MMT, an attribute sensitivity-based differential privacy (AS-DP) algorithm is proposed to balance security and availability of data and improve the differential privacy protection utility.

"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments. Several quantitative and qualitative experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve satisfactory prediction performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.","surveillance,dynamic AIS data,LSTM network,Hidden Markov models,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Internet of Things,smart traffic service improvement,abnormal behavior detection,high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction,intelligent maritime networks,Predictive models,deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction,maritime IoT,deep neural networks,Maritime Internt of Things,deep learning,moving vessels,ships,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,maritime surveillance,vessel traffic services,AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework,vessel traffic conflict situation modeling,6G mobile communication,maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,spatiotemporal vessel trajectories,revolutionary communication paradigm,long-short-term memory network,Trajectory,trajectory prediction,Navigation,combined satellite-terrestrial AIS,marine vehicles,realistic AIS-based vessel trajectories,unsatisfactory maritime safety,satisfactory prediction performance,"
"adjacent channel interference from maritime earth station in motion to 5g mobile service","2018","Earth station in motion (ESIM) service is an advanced satellite service and its demand is increasing around the world. 5G mobile service (IMT-2020) is also one of the most demanding systems in the world. As ESIM uplink will operate in 27.5-29.5 GHz band that is contiguous to a candidate band for 5G mobile service, both services should be confirmed for the possibility of adjacent channel compatibility. In this paper, we propose methods to analyze the adjacent channel interference from maritime ESIM to 5G mobile service. Minimum coupling loss (MCL) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods are used to obtain the minimum separation distance and the adjacent channel interference ratio (ACIR) required for the adjacent channel compatibility, and the throughput loss of 5G up and downlink for given separation distance and ACIRs.

"complex economic consequence analysis to protect the maritime infrastructure","2022","The marine transportation system (MTS) is a critical part of the nation's supply chain. Malicious actors, natural disasters, pandemics, geo-political events and larger marine casualties such as the 2021 Suez Canal grounding incident can disrupt the MTS and domestic and global supply chains. To date, most research and contingency planning has focused on single-event disruptions such as oil spills or security issues. While supply chains may be resilient enough to cope with a wide variety of single disruptions, aggregated challenges may result in cascading failures. There has been little analysis of the impacts of multiple disruptions that build on each other in complex ways. This suggests that modeling the impact of multiple vector disruptions on multiple MTS targets can help policy makers, business leaders, and others anticipate, plan for, mitigate, and rapidly recover from future complex disruptions. This paper describes an approach to research questions like: What are plausible examples of complex, multi-vector disruptions to the MTS? What could make their outcomes more complicated and challenging than those of single disruptions? What are their consequences for different components of the MTS? What are some pre-disruption mitigations and post-disruption resilience tactics that might be useful in such cases? How can we estimate the time to implement them, the costs of implementation, and the reduction of impact of such measures? The project described is developing a framework to address such questions. The framework will be used to analyze the impact of different combinations of individual disruptions, including natural disasters and climate change; security events, including cyber, accidents and marine casualties; and social/political disruptions. The analysis will focus on the total economic consequences of these threat combinations and transition into a user-friendly decision-support tool to improve risk management.","decision support systems,marine accidents,malicious actors,disasters,maritime,supply chain management,marine transportation system,marine casualties,total economic consequences,transportation,individual disruptions,marine navigation,Climate change,2021 Suez Canal grounding incident,security of data,Stakeholders,contingency planning,single-event disruptions,future complex disruptions,politics,Supply chains,pre-disruption mitigations,post-disruption resilience tactics,Maritime communication,maritime infrastructure,oil spills,risk management,user-friendly decision-support tool,economic consequences,resilience,MTS targets,supply chain,global supply chains,natural disasters,multivector disruptions,disruptions,security events,US Department of Homeland Security,complex economic consequence analysis,geo-political events,supply chains,Time measurement,Security,multiple vector disruptions,mitigation,Marine transportation,"
"artinali++: multi-dimensional specification mining for complex cyber-physical system security","2021","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) have been investigated as a key area of research since they are the core of Internet of Things. CPSs integrate computing and communication with control and monitoring of entities in the physical world. Due to the tight coupling of cyber and physical domains, and to the possible catastrophic consequences of the malicious attacks on critical infrastructures, security is one of the key concerns. However, the exponential growth of IoT has led to deployment of CPSes without support for enforcing important security properties. Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to be effective for securing these systems. Mining the specifications of CPSes by experts is a cumbersome and error-prone task. Therefore, it is essential to dynamically monitor the CPS to learn its common behaviors and formulate specifications for detecting malicious bugs and security attacks. Existing solutions for specification mining only combine data and events, but not time. However, time is a semantic property in CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for obtaining high accuracy. This paper proposes ARTINALI++, which dynamically mines specifications in CPS systems with arbitrary size and complexity. ARTINALI++ captures the security properties by incorporating time as a substantial property of the system, and generate a multi-dimensional model for the general CPS systems. Moreover, it enhances the model through discovering invariants that represent the physical motions and distinct operational modes in complex CPS systems. We build Intrusion Detection Systems based on ARTINALI++ for three CPSes with various levels of complexity including smart meter, smart artificial pancreas and unmanned aerial vehicle, and measure their detection accuracy. We find that the ARTINALI++ significantly reduces the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 23.45% and 73.6% on average, respectively, over other dynamic specification mining tools on the three CPS platforms.","Cyber-Physical Systems,Safety,Specification mining,Intrusion Detection Systems,Program analysis,Security,"

Next, we investigate current developments of cutting-edge technologies that enable heterogeneous multiaccess UWCs. Furthermore, we introduce UWC-enabled application scenarios that possibly improve the popularity of 6G in aquatic environments. Then, we analyze a feasible approach for a UWC integration to complement the 6G infrastructures, achieving a fully comprehensive framework.

Except for dedicated bridge equipment, there are hardly any products available that comply. One aspect from this standard is the low emission limit for radio frequency protection of the maritime very high frequency radio telephony system. This limit appears not to be based on a minimum range to receive a distress call, but on the possibility of receiving the lowest possible signal in an assumed placement of equipment. An analysis of the standard and a reconstruction of their rationale have led to an alternative, functional requirement with proper rationale, which can give the system integrator more flexibility in choosing equipment. This novel risk-based approach results in the same objective, i.e., an interference-free environment.

"security and qos issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: a tutorial","2022","The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics.

"enhancing ais to improve whale-ship collision avoidance and maritime security","2009","Whale-ship strikes are of growing worldwide concern due to the steady growth of commercial shipping. Improving the current situation involves the creation of a communication capability allowing whale position information to be estimated and exchanged among vessels and other observation assets. An early example of such a system has been implemented for the shipping lane approaches to the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts where ship traffic transits areas of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary frequently used by whales. It uses the Automated Identification Systems (AIS) technology, currently required for larger vessels but becoming more common in all classes of vessels. However, we believe the default mode of AIS operation will be inadequate to meet the long-term needs of whale-ship collision avoidance, and will likewise fall short of meeting other current and future marine safety and security communication needs. This paper explores the emerging safety and security needs for vessel communications, and considers the consequences of a communication framework supporting asynchronous messaging that can be used to enhance the basic AIS capability. The options we analyze can be pursued within the AIS standardization process, or independently developed with attention to compatibility with existing AIS systems. Examples are discussed for minimizing ship interactions with Humpback Whales and endangered North Atlantic Right Whales on the east coast, and North Pacific Right Whales, Bowhead Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales and Beluga Whales in west coast, Alaskan and Hawaiian waters.","marine accidents,North Atlantic right Whales,Whale-ship collision avoidance,Communication system security,Standardization,Marine vehicles,vessel communications,maritime security,Sea measurements,Whale position information,AIS technology,Humpback Whales,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Collision avoidance,Oceans,Beluga Whales,Boston,automated identification systems technology,North Pacific Right Whales,Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary,Economic forecasting,AIS enhancement,Marine technology,Bowhead Whales,Marine safety,Massachusetts,collision avoidance,Blue Whales,Whales,"
"aqua safe: blockchain based maritime communication system using ad hoc network","2022","The lack of a pre-existing infrastructure for facilitating long-range connectivity with the land makes maritime communications extremely difficult. Satellite connections, which are expensive, and use much power, are generally used to communicate on the high seas. For better connectivity between fisheries and land stations, different functional methods such as whether detection, boundary detection, data security, barrier detection, and data communication without interruption have been implemented in the system. Implementing a LoRa WAN system is to inform about emergencies in the deep sea and send the information indicated above. IoT node-based Ad hoc network is used to communicate with the land station without an internet connection. In case of emergency or when the fisheries need to send data and information to the land station in real-time, the fishing boat can interact with the land station through this proposed system.

"a deep semantic autoencoder for maritime wireless communications","2023","With the rapid development of maritime transportation, ocean tourism, monitoring, surveillance and aquaculture, the maritime communication industry has encountered new opportunities. Maritime End-to-end (E2E) communication systems based on deep learning (DL) have become diverse, while semantic communication systems have become a critical research point due to their ability to understand and analyze natural language. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic autoencoder (DSA) for maritime wireless communications. The DSA consists of a semantic encoder, channel encoder, channel decoder, and semantic decoder. The DSA employs transformers and convolutional neural networks to extract and restore the meaning of sentences while minimizing semantic errors during transmission. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the DSA in transmitting maritime data, the Rician fading channel is utilized to simulate complex and varied marine environments. Furthermore, the system parameters of the DSA are optimized through training the maritime data and calculating the loss functions.

"signal strength sensitivity and its effects on routing in maritime wireless networks","2008","Unlike terrestrial networks, the received signal strength in maritime wireless networks are subjected to perturbations due to the sea movement. Surface motions at sea cause variations in antenna heights and orientations of the communicating node (e.g. ships and buoys), thus affecting the received signal strength. In order to minimize such undesirable effects, we carried out a detailed study of the relationship between sea waves and the received signal strength. The effect of antenna gain variations due to tilting of antenna masts were studied by modeling sea waves. The channel path-loss variations were studied using a two-ray path-loss model for the maritime environment. Our analysis showed that the sea wave movements affect both short and longer links. We proposed a simple scheme to avoid the use of unstable links and implemented it on the QualNet network simulator.

"maritime smuggling detection and mitigation using risk-aware hybrid robotic sensor networks","2017","With the rise of more resourceful unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), their inclusion into robotic sensor networks (RSNs) is inevitable. The highly mobile nature of UAVs allows greater monitoring capabilities, making them most suitable for RSNs. Compared to traditional nodes in RSNs, UAVs suffer even more from communication disruptions and energy depletion, must often rapidly determine actions for themselves, and consequently require more autonomy. Prior work has been done in wireless sensor network (WSN)/aerial sensor network (ASN) coordination in a few applications such as protecting critical infrastructure, restoring communication between nodes, and healing networks, while other work has been accomplished on using the UAV network for augmenting the monitoring capabilities of WSNs. We introduce a novel methodology to integrate UAVs into RSNs for monitoring purposes by formulating the problem in the context of a risk management framework (RMF). This methodology allows a more precise risk feature classification and a more efficient task allocation for the ground network by utilizing the monitoring capabilities of the UAVs to informatively warn the RSN of any incoming events. We also present a fictitious but credible maritime smuggling scenario near the Port of Barcelona based on expert knowledge, and apply the methodology to detect and mitigate maritime smuggling. The network's behaviour is traced throughout the scenario and is repeated with civilian ships to assure that they are not flagged as smugglers.

"sensor information fusion architecture for virtual maritime environment","2012","This paper presents a ongoing research on generic sensor fusion architecture and its application to a maritime surveillance system. The importance of information fusion for various sensor types and specialized sensor fusion systems in various domains are discussed. In sensor fusion, centralized versus decentralized refers to where the fusion of the data occurs. In centralized fusion, the clients simply forward all of the data to a central location, and some entity at the central location is responsible for correlating and fusing the data. In this research we intend to correlate multiple maritime sensors such as RADAR, AIS, and other electronic object detection systems.

VBF is originally proposed for underwater acoustic sensor networks(UASN), but this article will show that VBF is an appropriate routing protocol for ARCNet. Based on the ns-3 simulation platform, we implement the ARCNet and the VBF protocol. Simulation results are presented to evaluate its performance under various network parameters.","telecommunication network reliability,data forwarding services,integrated network,radio links,underwater acoustic links,acoustic-radio cooperative maritime network,Internet access,routing protocols,Cooperative systems,Routing protocols,underwater acoustic sensor networks,wireless sensor networks,ARCNet,vector-based forwarding protocol,Sea surface,appropriate routing protocol,underwater equipment,heterogeneous network,network parameters,underwater acoustic communication,acoustic-radio cooperative network,Logic gates,maritime information networks,Acoustic sensors,ocean exploration activities,routing protocol,cooperative communication,vector-based forwarding,Simulation,transmission characteristics,Radio links,Internet,VBF protocol,"
"concurrent use of satellite imaging and passive acoustics for maritime domain awareness","2010","The research being conducted in the Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR), a DHS National Center of Excellence for Port Security examines some basic science issues and emerging technologies to improve the security of ports and inland waterways, as well as coastal and offshore operations. This research follows a layered approach utilizing above water and underwater surveillance techniques. The investigated layers include satellite-based wide area surveillance; HF Radar systems providing over-the-horizon monitoring; and nearshore and harbor passive acoustic surveillance. Integration of these systems is aimed at achieving vessel detection, classification, identification, and tracking. In this paper, we present the results of sea tests where satellite imagery was combined with concurrent passive acoustic surveillance. The wide area sensing was provided by the University of Miami CSTARS facility's electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. Satellites detected the ships using a panchromatic EO sensor FormoSat-2 and SAR from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The Stevens Passive Acoustic System was used for detecting sound produced by the same ships that were detected by satellites. Concurrent Satellite - Acoustic measurements provide the following advantages: 1. Increasing the probability of small vessel detection and decreasing false alarms. 2. The joint systems can provide redundant detection and classification in conditions where one of the systems fails. For example, EO satellite imaging does not work at night and in fog and cloudy conditions while acoustic detection has limits during stormy weather due to ambient noise. SAR imaging can detect vessels in all weather, but provides less detail about a specific vessel. 3. Acoustics can provide target classification and bearing and satellites can give target localization and heading. SAR data can be used to estimate vessel speed in some cases. 4. Satellite imaging is helpful for the acoustic detection of an underwater target in cases when satellite information allows separation of surface and underwater targets. 5. Joint measurements provide more data (information) for target classification. Several tests were conducted in New York Harbor, where the satellite images and acoustic signatures of the same boats were recorded. The satellite registered a number of small boats. The small boats were acoustically detected at distances up to 4 km and the signal generated by a passenger ferry was observed at a distance up to 7 km.","Satellites,military radar,Stevens passive acoustic system,CSTARS facility's electro-optical radar,maritime domain awareness,acoustic signature,maritime security,underwater vehicles,DHS National Center of Excellence,acoustic detection,satellite tracking,Acoustic sensing,target tracking,Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce,Miami University,HF radar systems,synthetic aperture radar,satellite imaging,panchromatic EO sensor,underwater surveillance,port security,radar imaging,vessel detection,optical radar,underwater acoustic communication,New York Harbor,Acoustics,offshore operations,Boats,Sonar equipment,coastal operations,satellite sensing,passive acoustics,acoustic surveillance,Surveillance,FormoSat-2,COSMO-SkyMed constellation,Security,target classification,"
"situational awareness measurement in a simulation-based training framework for offshore well control operations","2019","Human factors are identified as the major contributor to oil and gas drilling and operations related accidents. One major limitation of the currently available simulation-based training programs is the lack of objective and validated measures for human factors and non-technical skills. These objective measures are necessary to evaluate the skills and training of drilling crews. Situational awareness (SA) describes the person's perception, comprehension, and prediction in dynamic environments. SA is critical in time-sensitive decision making, which may be especially pertinent for kick-detection and blowout mitigation. This paper presents the analyses of multiple objective SA measures in an immersive training environment. The SA for a sample of engineering-in-training students (n = 13) was measured using a well control incident simulator. The data analyses include knowledge tests, a voice log analysis, usability measures, check-lists compliance, pre/post performance surveys, and eye-tracking data. The results show that task knowledge (e.g. current pressure readings, current bit depth) was predictive of overall blowout mitigation performance. Further, the usability results provide some preliminary insights into task risk perceptions, task difficulty, and perceptions of communication. The results may help design an objective simulation-based training framework for human factors and non-technical skills measurement in oil and gas well control operations.","Simulation-based training,Well control,Situation awareness,"
"integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ert and limited drillings at the hepu han tombs, in coastal area of southern china","2019","The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds. The results have shown a general consistency between the geophysical work and traditional archaeological drilling explorations, improving our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allowing detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.","Burial mounds,Hepu Han Tombs,Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT),Drillings,"
"a wideband satellite maritime channel model simulator","2022","In this article, we present implementation details of a generative satellite maritime propagation channel model at L-band. In an earlier paper, we presented the parameterization of the channel model for the narrowband case based on recordings of GPS L1  $C/N_{0}$  time-series in different sea state conditions. Additionally, we performed wider band measurements using GPS E5a (â‰ˆ10 Mcpsâ€”chips per secondâ€” > 20 MHz bandwidth) and obtained estimations of power delay profiles. Due to lack of dynamic range and delay resolution, in these measurements, no conclusive information was gathered on the time spreading caused by the channel. What was clear is that the time spreading was not significant outside the first signal chip, i.e.,  $\approx 0.1~\mu \text{s}$ . Still wideband modeling is required within this spreading range. Now, we want to extend the model to the wideband case. To achieve this goal, we have used a rough surface scattering model applicable to sea surfaces and employed it to characterize the time dispersion to be expected. Additionally, we also used this scattering model to help verify the validity of the existing Doppler spread model. Furthermore, ship movements in the waves play a role. We try and analyze this issue. Finally, we present a detailed discussion on various implementation issues we came across when coding the simulator.","delay resolution,power delay profiles,satellite maritime propagation channel model,sea surface,wider band measurements,Global Positioning System,Modeling,Sea measurements,Rough surfaces,wideband,wideband modeling,dynamic range,satellite communication,time dispersion,Scattering,time 0.1 mus,ships,wideband satellite maritime channel model simulator,radiowave propagation,earlier paper,narrowband case,scattering,Sea surface,Wideband,rough surface scattering model,Sea state,rough surfaces,Doppler effect,wireless channels,signal chip,spreading range,sea surfaces,different sea state conditions,wideband case,existing Doppler spread model,Surface roughness,broadband networks,frequency 20.0 MHz,marine communication,radio receivers,L-band,"

However, deploying wireless sensor networks on the sea poses many challenges and for maritime surveillance security applications we may need to deploy sensors both on the sea surface and underwater for three-dimensional detection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid ocean sensor networks called Double-head maritime Sensor Networks (DSNs), which combine the advantages of wireless sensor networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. By leveraging the unique characteristics of DSNs, we design a localization scheme LDSN which is consisted of two algorithms SML and FLA.

"spectrum sensing for cognitive maritime vhf networks","2014","The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used worldwide as a maritime system for identifying and locating vessels by exchanging data in Very High Frequency (VHF) band with other nearby ships, AIS base stations and satellites. It is an important system for safety of navigation to assist collision avoidance and enables marine traffic supervision and management. However, the expanding use of AIS band by other emerging applications and services has caused significant increase on the maritime VHF Data Link (VDL) load, hampering smooth exchange of critical AIS information. Instead of assigning new frequency resources for new marine VDL services, in this paper we present a solution to overcome this spectrum scarcity issue by utilizing Cognitive Radio (CR) technology in maritime AIS VHF network. A preliminary analysis of the performance of such an approach is carried out taking into account the different properties and challenges of marine communication channels due to sea surface movement.

Some researchers have considered using Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) to improve the performance of data transmission in maritime environment. Most existing work on maritime DTNs usually uses simulation to evaluate the transmission performance in maritime DTNs. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to analyze the performance of data transmission in maritime DTNs. We first construct a model to describe the ship encounter probability. Then, we use this model to analyze the data delivery ratio from ships in the seaway to the base station (BS) at coast. Based on the data of tracing the ships navigating in a realistic seaway, we develop a simulator and validate the theoretical models.

These changes have greatly increased the energy consumption and bandwidth requirements of vessel terminals and networks. In order to meet the requirements of high bandwidth and low delay for the high-speed development of mobile network, and reduce the network load, the concept of mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed and has been widely supported by the academia and industry. It is considered to be one of the key technologies of the next generation networks. Inspired by this idea, this paper introduces computing offloading technology to maritime mobile cloud networks. Maritime mobile cloud network is the product of the continuous development of cloud computing technology and mobile Internet technology. In this paper, we studied the issue of computation task offloading for vessel terminals, focusing on minimizing the energy consumption of vessel terminals and the execution delay of computation task. First, it determines that whether if it should be offloaded to the cloud server. Second, the server should be selected to run the computation task. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the energy consumption of vessel terminals and the execution delay of computation task taking into account of different weights.

However, the security dimensions of maritime VSAT services are not well understood. Historically, high equipment costs have acted as a barrier to entry for both researchers and attackers. In this paper we demonstrate a substantial change in threat model, proving practical attacks against maritime VSAT networks with less than $400 of widely-available television equipment. This is achieved through GSExtract, a purpose-built forensic tool which enables the extraction of IP traffic from highly corrupted VSAT data streams.The implications of this threat are assessed experimentally through the analysis of more than 1.3 TB of real-world maritime VSAT recordings encompassing 26 million square kilometers of coverage area. The underlying network platform employed in these systems is representative of more than 60% of the global maritime VSAT services market. We find that sensitive data belonging to some of the world's largest maritime companies is regularly leaked over VSAT ship-to-shore communications. This threat is contextualized through illustrative case studies ranging from the interception and alteration of navigational charts to theft of passport and credit card details.

"ship behavior recognition based on infrared video analysis in a maritime environment","2015","In order to improve the monitoring capability of officer on watch for the environment around the own ship, cover the shortage of RADAR and AIS in ship behavior recognition field, this paper proposes a ship behavior recognition algorithm based on video analysis. After analyzing the ship behavior we found that the silhouette's size and shape variation of ship in infrared image were related to its behavior over a period of time, that is to say when the distance between the own ship and the target ship has decreased during this period, its silhouette's size would increase. And when the target ship is heading toward the own ship directly and the distance between them has decreased (the DCPA (Distance to Closest Point of Approach) is very small, and the TCPA (Time to Closest Point of Approach) is decreasing), the silhouette's size of the target ship would enlarge, nevertheless, its silhouette's shape would have no significant changes. According to these characteristics of ship behavior, the height of target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's size and the ratio between the width and the height of the target ship's silhouette is used to represent silhouette's shape in the ship behavior recognition algorithm we proposed. And then the least square method is used to fit the height and the ratio into straight line during this period respectively, whose slope reflects the changing trend and variation of target ship's silhouette. At last, the recognition algorithm was verified by analyzing infrared video in a maritime environment, which shows that the characteristic of ship behavior summarized by this paper is correct and the recognition algorithm based on them is feasible.","Time to Closest Point of Approach,Cameras,Marine vehicles,Character recognition,intelligent recognition,ship behavior,Target recognition,ships,maritime surveillance,Image recognition,DCPA,Shape,least squares approximations,video analysis,Radar,infrared image,target ship,video signal processing,ship behavior recognition algorithm,TCPA,infrared imaging,maritime environment,marine communication,least square method,infrared video,Distance to Closest Point of Approach,object recognition,"
"analysis of optimal backhaul link selection in a novel maritime communication network","2017","Offshore fishing is serving as a major livelihood for millions of people around the world. OceanNet project aims at developing an effective, low-cost, long range communication system to provide internet connectivity at the sea. Wireless Backhaul network is formed by connecting Base Station (BS) in the shore to the Adaptive Backhaul Equipment (ABE) in the boats. The fishermen fishing in a particular fishing zone form a cluster. A mesh network is formed in the clusters to improve the connectivity. In this work, OceanNet Backhaul Link Selection (OBLS) algorithm is implemented in a hardware test-bed that models the OceanNet topology to assess the feasibility of using this in the off-shore boats. It also proposes and implements a controller as a static node in the Base Station network which analyzes the connectivity based on signal strength, noise floor and link quality and selects the best backhaul links by redirecting the route from Access Routers to the ABE having good Signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio to reach the Base Station. The throughput tests analyzed demonstrate that the packet delivery ratio is improved to a large extent after the application of the OBLS algorithm.","maritime network,Wireless Backhaul network,wireless mesh networks,optimal backhaul link selection,Mesh networks,fishing zone,Wireless communication,backhaul network,OceanNet,hardware test-bed,mesh network,backhaul links,telecommunication network topology,OceanNet Backhaul Link Selection algorithm,internet connectivity,fishermen fishing,heterogeneous network,long range communication system,OceanNet project,telecommunication traffic,OceanNet topology,maritime communication network,ABE,noise floor,Boats,Wireless fidelity,marine communication,Adaptive Backhaul Equipment,Base Station network,Signal-to-noise ratio,off-shore boats,Signal to noise ratio,OBLS algorithm,Internet,Base stations,offshore fishing,link quality,controller,"

"instantaneous global navigation satellite system (gnss)-based attitude determination for maritime applications","2012","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a valuable technology for a large number of maritime applications. Other than providing the absolute positioning service, it aids many demanding applications, such as precise docking, formation of surface craft, autonomous vehicles, sinkage monitoring, etc. GNSS carrier-phase-based algorithms provide high-precision positioning solutions, but an integer number of cycles inherent to the observed signal have to be resolved. A newly developed GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity resolution method is tested. The new method solves for the unknown number of integer cycles by exploiting the known placement of the GNSS antennas aboard the vessel. The a priori information on the antennas baseline separation is employed as a hard constraint. A simplified (linearized) version of the method, suitable for large vessels, is also analyzed. The new method was tested against the most challenging scenario when processing GNSS data: single-frequency, single-epoch, unaided ambiguity resolution. Through different tests, the high performance of the new method is demonstrated: high fixing rate, large robustness, and short time-to-fix after initialization, cycle slips, and/or loss of locks. Considerations about the wide spectra of maritime applications are given, and a specific experiment is carried out to demonstrate the capabilities of the method for navigation in shallow waters.","Antennas,shipborne attitude,Position measurement,Vectors,high-precision positioning,Marine vehicles,sinkage monitoring,under-keel clearance (UKC),instantaneous global navigation satellite system,satellite navigation,GNSS antennas,Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),Ambiguity resolution,carrier-phase ambiguity resolution,maritime applications,Global Navigation Satellite Systems,Minimization,marine communication,attitude determination,Estimation,constrained least squares,"
"fading modeling in maritime container terminal environments","2018","In this paper, an analytical model for slow and fast fading effects in maritime container terminals is derived, from fitting distributions to the results of measurements performed in an actual operational environment. The proposed model is composed of a set of equations, enabling to evaluate fading statistical distribution parameters for different system and environments conditions, as a function of frequency, base station antenna height, and average height of container stacks in a deepwater container terminal. The model's coefficients were obtained from a multivariate linear regression of the fitted distributions parameters, allowing to evaluate the different statistical distribution parameters with a negligible mean error and a standard deviation of the error less than 0.65 dB. It is observed that a good fitting is obtained for slow fading with the Lognormal Distribution, the standard deviation ranging in [1.40, 4.81] dB, while fast fading is well modeled by the Nakagami Distribution with the standard deviation ranging in [0.43, 1.26].

"connectivity and route analysis for a maritime communication network","2007","We are interested in extending the coverage of a terrestrial wireless communication network to the sea so that cost effective communications can be provided to the ships. The coverage extension can be achieved by using ships as relay nodes for other ships that are further away. This paper studies the feasibility of doing so at the Singapore East Coast. The feasibility is based on having 90% of the nodes connected to the terrestrial network 90% of the times. Using actual ship mobility traces in the area, we confirm that such a network is feasible when transmission range between land station and ship is at least 15 km and transmission range between ships is at least 8 km. For a feasible network, there are always multiple candidate routes between a ship and the land station, and the average path length of the candidate routes is about 1.8. This calls for possible use of multi-path routing protocols, and the short path length implies a potentially acceptable end-to-end delay for real-time traffic.","real-time traffic,Wireless communication,routing protocols,Vehicle dynamics,marine communication,multi-path routing protocols,Underwater communication,route analysis,Communication networks,Ad hoc networks,Spread spectrum communication,Costs,connectivity analysis,Marine vehicles,Relays,Communication effectiveness,maritime communication network,"

"non-satellite broadband maritime communications for e-navigation services","2021","The development of broadband network access technologies available to users on land has triggered a rapid expansion of a diverse range of services provided by terrestrial networks. However, due to limitations of digital communication technologies in the off-shore area, the maritime ICT systems evolution so far has not followed that trend. Despite the e-navigation initiative defining the set of Maritime Services, the progress in the maritime ICT systems evolution has been slow. Only a few systems, including the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES), or the TRI-Media Telematic Oceanographic Network (TRITON) have been proposed to extend the basic set of services offered by classical radio-communication solutions. However, all those systems have significant limitations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the netBaltic system designed as a fully heterogeneous system for modern maritime communications. Its unique feature is the capability to transparently use different communication technologies to efficiently support maritime ICT services, as well as openness for the incorporation of future communication technologies. The paper presents an overview of VDES, TRITON and netBaltic systems and analysis showing their expected strengths and weaknesses. The systems are then compared in simulated environments, illustrating real-world usage scenarios based on real maritime traffic information and performance measurements obtained during off-shore measurement campaigns. Results indicate that netBaltic seems to be the most versatile one and is capable of offering access to all services defined by International Maritime Organization, due to its ability to use different communication technologies simultaneously and functionality offered by its Delay Tolerant Networking component.","international maritime organization,Safety,wireless mesh networks,broadband network access technologies,wireless communication,Organizations,Communication systems,Wireless communication,VHF data exchange system,maritime ICT services,future communication technologies,maritime ICT systems evolution,different communication technologies,satellite communication,data communication,performance measurements,terrestrial networks,Broadband communication,digital communication technologies,TRI media telematic oceanographic network,modern maritime communications,netBaltic system,maritime services,maritime traffic information,telecommunication traffic,fully heterogeneous system,marine technology,classical radio communication solution,nonsatellite broadband maritime communications,broadband networks,computer networks,marine communication,e-navigation Services,network topology,mobile communication,Navigation,Task analysis,Information and communication technology,"
"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"

"an identity-based data integrity auditing scheme for cloud-based maritime transportation systems","2023","With the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS), massive data generated in the system not only requires to be stored reliably and cheaply, but also needs to be analyzed timely. The Cloud-based Maritime Transportation Systems (CMTS) allow users to upload the data without worrying about the price, capacity, location and so on. However, CMTS also brings some security issues, where the integrity protection of outsourced data is one of the most important issues since it is crucial for the safety, reliability and efficiency of sea lanes. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based dynamic data integrity auditing scheme for CMTS. Our scheme decreases the burden of key management and improves the auditing efficiency by batch auditing. Besides, our scheme also supports dynamic operations on the outsourced data for CMTS. The security analysis shows that our scheme can ensure the feature of storage correctness and resist common attacks.

"analyzing congestion interdependencies of ports and container ship routes in the maritime network infrastructure","2018","Events, such as prolonged congestion in ports or unavailable ship routes in the maritime network, often initiate cascading congestions that block transportation and/or disrupt services over wide areas. Existing traffic flow analysis methods lack the ability to understand the cascading effects of delays in ship routes or how to reduce overall delays in greater maritime areas. Dependency risk graphs have been proposed as a tool for analyzing such cascading events using dependency chains. This paper proposes a risk-based interdependency analysis method capable to detect large-scale traffic congestions between interconnected ports and ship routes in the maritime network and provide solutions to improve flow. Presented dependency risk chains of ports along with graph theory help us analyze ship routes and detect ports that are affected most when other major ports are congested in the maritime network, detect the causes of bottlenecks, and provide valuable info in relieving delays across container ship routes. We apply the proposed method on historical container ship routing data provided by the MarineTraffic company that maintains a comprehensive maritime database worldwide for more than six million users monthly. This application-oriented, interdisciplinary effort culminated in a prototype tool is able to analyze the historical data for container ships in the entire global maritime network and detect congestion dependencies. The tool can be used to identify key shipping routes or ports that: 1) are prone to delays; 2) greatly affect the overall maritime network due to position, connections and risk of congestion; and/or 3) get affected the most by delays in previous route legs.","maritime database worldwide,cascading effects,Transportation,telecommunication network routing,graph,congestion interdependency analysis,centrality,vehicle routing,interconnected ports,transportation,Marine vehicles,sector,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime,infrastructure,cascading,delay,Containers,ships,dependency risk chains,container,risk-based interdependency analysis method,dependency,flow,congestion,MarineTraffic company,impact,global maritime network infrastructure,sea ports,historical container ship routing data,containers,traffic flow analysis methods,graph theory,large-scale traffic congestion detection,risk,marine communication,Tools,route,Analytical models,port,"
"tcp performance in satellite backhauling for maritime communications: a ns-3 study","2022","In maritime communications, using satellites as the backhaul is an important scenario. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the most dominant transport-layer protocol and directly affects user experience. Due to the inherent high propagation delay and random packet loss characteristics of satellite link, it may cause TCP performance be seriously affected using a satellite backhaul. To analyze the TCP performance in satellite backhauling, this paper combines the Long Term Evolution (LTE) model in ns-3 with a geostationary communication satellite model (sns3) to build a practical satellite-based backhauling system. The paper compares the throughput and latency performance of several state-of-the-art TCP variants, namely Cubic, Hybla, Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT (BBR), Copa and PCC. It is found that the TCP variants exhibit different advantages/disadvantages in different testing scenarios, suggesting that no one is a clear winner in the satellite-backhauling systems.

"application scenarios of nautical ad-hoc network for maritime communications","2009","In terrestrial wireless communications, high data-rate transmission can be readily achieved by installing base stations on the ground. However, the same system may not be adapted to maritime communication due to the geographically restricted nature of the sea, and therefore, MF/HF modems, capable of long-distance transmission, with low data-rate are frequently employed in maritime communication. Maritime satellite communication through Inmarsat is conventionally used to compensate for the low data-rate transmission of MF/HF modems, but its high cost still remains as a main drawback. In order to enhance the transmission speed with a fairly low price, in general, a network whose architecture is similar to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), that allows peer-to-peer communications without base stations, i.e., ad-hoc network, is crucial. Herein, we propose an ad-hoc network for nautical environment, which is named as Nautical Ad-hoc Network (NANET). In this paper, scenarios toward NANET development are described and analysis of multiple access and duplexing schemes for corresponding NANET scenarios is discussed. A guideline for further research and developmental strategies on NANET is also suggested.","Wireless communication,NANET,Peer to peer computing,ad hoc networks,Underwater communication,Marine safety,IP networks,mobile communication,Ad hoc networks,Modems,Costs,Satellite communication,marine vehicles,Base stations,peer-to-peer communications,Marine vehicles,maritime communications,nautical ad-hoc network,"
"horizon detection from electro-optical sensors under maritime environment","2020","In recent years, target detection in maritime surveillance has become a popular subject. Horizon under maritime environment is one of the most important semantic boundaries for segmenting the image into sea and sky. With the help of horizon, seeking scope can be restricted to a definite small area, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. Meanwhile, horizon is used to automatically adjust the attitude of air vehicles as well. Although a plenty of algorithms for horizon detection have been created, they are prone to low visibility and occlusions. In this paper, a novel robust algorithm based on probability distribution and physical characteristics is proposed. At first, the probabilities are distributed to each vertically divided region by weighted textures, and the sea-sky region is located from definite probabilistic intervals. Based on a Canny edge detector, Hough transform extracts a series of candidate horizons. Finally, a novel voting method is applied. The line with the maximum value will be regarded as the true horizon. The proposed algorithm can not only precisely detect the horizon from fine images but also from blurred image, even with splashed camera. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments on 65 videos containing more than 20 000 frames under different sceneries. The results illustrate that our algorithm can detect the horizon line with minor errors in comparison with other five state-of-the-art algorithms.","Image edge detection,electro-optical sensors,target detection,Feature extraction,Contextual information,Image color analysis,edge detection,sea-sky region,seaâ€“sky region extraction,Hough transforms,maritime surveillance,object detection,Probability distribution,image texture,horizon detection,electro-optical devices,physical characteristics,semantic boundaries,electro-optical sensor,maritime environment,marine communication,image sensors,Sensors,Computational modeling,image segmentation,Transforms,"
"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction.

However, the resources-constrained maritime users cannot meet the high requirements of transmission delay and energy consumption, due to the excessive traffic and limited resources in maritime networks. To solve this problem, mobile edge computing is taken as a promising paradigm to help mobile devices from edge servers via computation offloading considering the different quality of service (QoS) with the complex ocean environments, resulting in energy saving and increased transmission latency. To investigate the tradeoff between latency and energy consumption in low-cost large-scale maritime communication, we formulate the offloading optimization problem and propose a two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm, optimizing computation and communication resource allocation under limited energy and sensitive latency. At the first stage, the maritime users make the decision on whether to offload a computation considering their demands and environments. Then, the channel allocation and power allocation problems were proposed to optimize the offloading policy which coordinates with the center cloud servers at the second stage, considering the dynamic tradeoff of latency and energy consumption. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","offloading strategies,telecommunication power management,channel allocation,computation offloading,maritime data,limited resources,ocean network,dynamic tradeoff,two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm,energy-efficiency,resources-constrained maritime users,QoS,Internet of Things,quality of service,Marine vehicles,Maritime Internet-of-Things,Resource management,large-scale maritime communication,mobile edge computing (MEC),two-stage offloading optimization,Servers,Energy???latency tradeoff,cloud computing,maritime networks,Oceans,optimisation,communication resource allocation,mobile computing,mobile edge computing,energy-latency tradeoff,offloading policy,maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT),network traffic,energy saving,transmission delay,telecommunication traffic,complex ocean environments,energy consumption,mobile devices,Cloud computing,marine communication,power allocation problems,cloud server,offloading optimization problem,Task analysis,maritime activities,resource allocation,edge servers,M-IoT devices,"

"adaptive network based fuzzy inference system for frequency regulation in modern maritime power systems","2019","It is expected that the wireless technologies will play a large role as communication infrastructures in the next generation of the marine power systems due to some benefits, such as large information reliability, wide coverage area, etc. However, such technologies are exposed to some network degradations such as transmission delays, packet loss and network congestion, which highly threaten the reliability of the networked control system. Thus, the effects of the network degradations should be considered during the controller design procedure since they will lead to system instability.

"data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis: trends and perspectives towards industry 4.0","2019","The so-called “smartization” of manufacturing industries has been conceived as the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0, a paradigm shift propelled by the upsurge and progressive maturity of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) applied to industrial processes and products. From a data science perspective, this paradigm shift allows extracting relevant knowledge from monitored assets through the adoption of intelligent monitoring and data fusion strategies, as well as by the application of machine learning and optimization methods. One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive). This threefold analysis, along with a discussion on its hardware and software implications, intends to serve as a stepping stone for future researchers and practitioners to join the community investigating on this vibrant field.","Industry 4.0,Machine learning,Data-driven prognosis,Data fusion,"
"data-driven trajectory quality improvement for promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6g-enabled maritime iot systems","2021","Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","short-term memory-based supervised learning technique,maritime traffic monitoring,recurrent neural nets,supervised learning technique,intelligent maritime navigation,data-driven applications,AIS networks,Internet of Things,Monitoring,neural networks,6G-enabled maritime IoT systems,vessel collision avoidance,time stamped point restoration,shipboard AIS devices,BLSTM,two-phase vessel reconstruction framework,spatial data,5G mobile communication,automatic identification system,maritime IoT applications,supervised learning,vessel traffic services,signal reconstruction,intelligent vessel traffic services,6G mobile communication,pattern clustering,vessel trajectories,Artificial intelligence,analogue-digital conversion,two-phase data-driven machine,raw AIS data system,telecommunication traffic,maritime Internet of Things (IoT),6G wireless systems,integrated automatic equipment,Trajectory,signal detection,vessel trajectory reconstruction,marine communication,automatic identification system (AIS),Navigation,maritime industries,bidirectional long short-term memory,combined satellite-terrestrial communication,data-driven trajectory quality improvement,massive trajectory data,future generation communication systems,"
"application of track-before-detect techniques in gnss-based passive radar for maritime surveillance","2019","GNSS-based passive radar has been recently proved able to enable moving target detection in maritime surveillance applications. The main restriction lies in the low Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) level of navigation satellites. Extending the integration times with proper target motion compensation has been shown to be a viable solution to improve ship detectability, but this involves computational complexity and increasing sensitivity to motion model mismatches. In this work, we consider the application of a Track-Before-Detect (TBD) method to considerably increase the integration time (and therefore the detection capability) at the same time keeping the computational complexity affordable by practical systems. Dynamic programming TBD algorithms have been specialized for the considered framework and tested against experimental dataset.

The UAV-to-ship channel modeling is the fundamental for the system design, testing, and performance evaluation of UAV communication systems in maritime scenarios. In this paper, a novel non-stationary multi-mobility UAV-to-ship channel model is proposed, consisting of three kinds of components, i.e., the line-of-sight (LoS) component, the single-bounce (SB) components resulting from the fluctuation of sea water, and multi-bounce (MB) components introduced by the waveguide effect over the sea surface. In the proposed model, the UAV as the transmitter (Tx), the ship as the receiver (Rx), and the clusters between the Tx and Rx, can be seen as moving with arbitrary velocities and arbitrary directions. Then, some typical statistical properties of the proposed UAV-to-ship channel model, including the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF), spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), delay PSD, angular PSD, stationary interval, and root mean square (RMS) delay spread, are derived and investigated.

The proximity-based IoT service is a type of service that becomes available once an IoT object comes near other objects. This type of service typically involves proximity machine-type communication (MTC) that allows direct communication between objects in a spatiotemporal context on an ad-hoc basis. The IoT world has witnessed increasing cases of such applications in recent years, but proximity MTC has not received sufficient attention in the IoT community. As such, this paper presents the unique characteristics and requirements of proximity MTC, focusing on differentiating proximity MTC from infrastructure-based wide-area MTC and service-centric networking from host-centric networking. Specifically, the paper utilizes an emerging application in maritime IoT, maritime autonomous surface shipping (MASS), as an example and offers an insightful and rigorous examination of the legacy maritime communications technology, pointing out the pitfalls to avoid in the development and standardization of proximity MTC in light of the recent spectrum assignment by ITU.

"a single-carrier delay-and-superposition based high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying for maritime internet of vessels","2022","The fast growing Internet of Vessels (IoV) requires maritime communications to be more spectral efficient to make full use of the scarce maritime spectral resource, provide a high data transmission rate and support massive communication nodes to access the network. However, the spectral efficiency of most existing maritime communications are still relatively low, and consequently maritime communications can hardly support high volume multi-user communications. Therefore, in this paper, a high spectral efficiency Differential Chaos Shift Keying system based on a single-carrier delay-and-superposition modulation technology (SCDS-DCSK) is proposed for IoV scenarios. In a SCDS-DCSK symbol, all sub-carriers have the same frequency, indicating that the symbol of SCDS-DCSK only occupies the bandwidth of a single sub-channel. As a result, a large amount of maritime communication resources can be saved for accommodating more communication nodes and the spectral efficiency is significantly improved. System architectures and principles are firstly demonstrated. Then, the spectral efficiency, peak mean power ratio (PAPR), complexity, and the origin of error bits of SCDS-DCSK are analyzed, and the bit-error-rate expressions are derived. Moreover, effects of various system parameters and levels of sea states on the system performance are simulated and discussed. Simulation results verify the theoretical analyses, and manifest that the SCDS-DCSK can achieve a high spectral efficiency under various sea states. Thanks to characteristics such as high spectral efficiency, flexible parameter configuration, and simple implementation, SCDS-DCSK is a promising technology for improving the quality of service (QoS) of future maritime IoV.","single-carrier delay-and-superposition,peak mean power ratio,QoS,quality of service,SCDS-DCSK symbol,PAPR,modulation,future maritime IoV,Vessels,chaos,maritime communication resources,error statistics,Maritime communications,spectral efficiency,single subchannel,single carrier delay,Modulation,superposition modulation technology,Sea state,fast growing Internet,support massive communication nodes,chaotic communication,consequently maritime communications,Frequency modulation,high data transmission rate,Symbols,high volume multiuser communications,Chaotic communication,marine communication,maritime Internet of Vessels,Spectral efficiency,Internet of Vessels (IoV),Internet,scarce maritime spectral resource,high spectral efficiency differential chaos shift keying system,maritime communications,"
"a general orthogonal transform aided mimo design for reliable maritime visible light communications","2020","In maritime visible light communication (VLC) systems, user information is delivered among different terminals distributed in the atmosphere, and the underwater environment. To combat the complex and variant marine channel conditions induced by the absorption, scattering, and turbulence influence, in this article, we propose a general orthogonal transform (OT) aided multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission scheme to enhance the transmission reliability performances. In our design, we propose to construct the orthogonal transform matrix recursively with the Hadamard matrix. Thus we could exploit the repetitive property of the elements in the orthogonal matrix to enlarge the Euclidean distances among the signals. Moreover, the value of the elements could be adjusted dynamically to adapt to time-changing channel conditions. Thanks to the orthogonality of the matrix, and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the interferences among signals could be effectively suppressed. Accordingly, the reliability performances can be improved. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical symbol error rate (SER) expressions for the proposed design. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the SER performances with different water types, and wind speeds in various scenarios of the atmosphere, underwater, and air-water interface channels are investigated, and compared with the counterpart systems.","telecommunication network reliability,multiple input multiple output transmission scheme,underwater environment,Reliability engineering,user information,transmission reliability performances,Visible light communication,maritime visible light communication systems,matrix algebra,singular value decomposition,variant marine channel conditions,reliability,multiple input multiple output,Matrix decomposition,turbulence influence,free-space optical communication,Scattering,orthogonal transform aided MIMO design,Reliability theory,error statistics,Euclidean distances,orthogonal transform matrix,maritime visible light communication,wireless channels,symbol error rate expressions,reliable maritime visible light communications,SER performances,Hadamard matrix,marine communication,complex marine channel conditions,orthogonal transform,Air and underwater channels,MIMO communication,Transforms,air-water interface channels,"

"uav-aided anti-jamming maritime communications: a deep reinforcement learning approach","2021","Maritime communication suffers from reactive jammer that keeps silent when the channel is idle and launches jamming signals as soon as sensing the activity on the channel to disrupt the maritime communication and even cause the maritime tracking and monitoring task failure. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based maritime anti-jamming communication scheme that applies the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the relay to forward the message between ships. This scheme enables both the transmitting ship and the UAV to select the power control policy without relying on the jamming model and the message generation model. Instead, the policies are chosen based on the current state consisting of the distances, the received signal strength indication, the received jamming power and the bit error rate (BER). We design two dueling neutral networks respectively to select the power control policy and update the network weights to reduce the overestimation. The dueling architecture consists of two streams that estimate the value of the current state and the state-dependent advantage function of the power control policy to accelerate the learning speed. A UAV-aided anti-jamming maritime communication game is formulated and the performance bound including the BER of marine messages and the energy consumption of the transmitting ship and the UAV is derived based on the Stackelberg equilibrium.

"effect of smart meter data collection frequency in an early detection of shorter-duration voltage anomalies in smart grids","2019","Smart grids are required to respond quickly and efficiently to any types of electrical incidents. This is possible only if advanced monitoring and decision support tools are available for the operators to collect and analyze the real-time data from the entire power system. Sensors and smart meters become necessary for an effective smart grid operation, as they can play a significant role in measuring system parameters such as the temperature of the transmission line, power outages and power usage. These sensors allow communication between the generation side and user side to ensure full network observability. Hence, the volume of data which needs to be analyzed for more reliable electrical services has been increased. Upon the analysis of all the data collected, useful insights can be gained to bring benefits to the utilities, consumers and the related organizations. In this project, the effect of smart meter data collection frequencies on the early detection of short-duration voltage anomalies has been investigated. An anomaly detection algorithm that analyzes the voltages collected from smart meters is developed. The proposed anomaly detector checks the normality of the voltage data collected from the smart meters installed at the residential loads. To test the effectiveness of the frequent-and-large smart meter data, a smart grid model was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the model was tested under three different operating conditions. The efficacy of the anomaly detector with the smart meter data collected at different data collection intervals was compared under the three operating conditions. The investigation of the smart meter data clearly shows that the shorter-duration anomalies can be detected effectively with more frequent data and hence it reveals the potential of smart meters in the early detection of short-duration anomalies in smart grids.","Smart devices,Anomaly detection system,Photovoltaic system,Large data,Smart grid,"

"novel maritime channel models for millimeter radiowaves","2016","This work presents and analyzes the results of millimeter-wave propagation simulations performed for over the sea LoS ship to ship communication channels. We present a channel characterization study where channel parameters such as path loss, received power, RMS delay spread, and power delay profile are obtained by using a ray tracing approach. 5G candidate frequencies, 35 GHz and 94 GHz were chosen as the primary bands of interest since these two bands have minimum water and oxygen attenuation, thereby promising better performance among the other frequency bands. Our results indicate that 2-ray analytical propagation loss model should only be used for short ranges over the sea surface propagation at typical frequencies considered by 5G. However, free space path loss model cannot predict the behavior of channel over the sea surface in high frequencies even for short ranges. Therefore, in this study a new model that is the modified version of 2-ray path loss model is proposed, in which a coefficient in the power of exponential function is introduced to better predict the behavior of maritime channels of 5G. It is shown that the proposed model can predict the path loss of maritime channel better than the existing models.","ray tracing,millimeter radiowaves,free space path loss model,Ducts,wireless path loss,Delays,Mathematical model,Maritime channel modeling,novel maritime channel models,Predictive models,radiowaves,oxygen attenuation,exponential function,sea surface propagation,millimeter wave propagation simulations,Propagation losses,Sea surface,propagation loss model,sea LoS ship,maritime channels,channel parameters,wireless channels,marine communication,Receivers,ship communication channels,"

"dltif: deep learning-driven cyber threat intelligence modeling and identification framework in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","The recent burgeoning of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the maritime industry is successfully digitalizing Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS). In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies.

"botnet detection based on traffic behavior analysis and flow intervals","2013","Botnets represent one of the most serious cybersecurity threats faced by organizations today. Botnets have been used as the main vector in carrying many cyber crimes reported in the recent news. While a significant amount of research has been accomplished on botnet analysis and detection, several challenges remain unaddressed, such as the ability to design detectors which can cope with new forms of botnets. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect botnet activity based on traffic behavior analysis by classifying network traffic behavior using machine learning. Traffic behavior analysis methods do not depend on the packets payload, which means that they can work with encrypted network communication protocols. Network traffic information can usually be easily retrieved from various network devices without affecting significantly network performance or service availability. We study the feasibility of detecting botnet activity without having seen a complete network flow by classifying behavior based on time intervals. Using existing datasets, we show experimentally that it is possible to identify the presence of existing and unknown botnets activity with high accuracy even with very small time windows.","Intrusion detection,Botnet,Network flows,Traffic behavior analysis,Machine learning,"

"satellite machine-type communication for maritime internet of things: an interference perspective","2019","Satellite machine-type communication plays a crucial role in the maritime Internet of Things. The realization of such a system, i.e., the VHF data exchange (VDES) satellite system, however, faces many technical challenges. Due to its global broadcasting nature, the interference generated from the emissions of the VDES satellite space stations to the incumbent or future land systems in the same band is of major concern to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) spectrum allocation. However, neither regulatory rules nor related studies have been specified or made available in the literature regarding such interference. This paper utilizes the electromagnetic power flux density (PFD) mask concept for evaluating and constraining the emission onto earth from a satellite space station. The mathematical analysis and derivation are based on the principle that the actual interference from a space station that a land system experiences is no worse than that from any other land system allowed by the regulations. We demonstrate the derivation of such a PFD mask from three closely related regulations on the legacy land mobile systems by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) and ITU and present the corresponding constraints imposed on the VDES satellite system and their impacts on the performance of the system.","VDES satellite space station system,interference perspective,satellite machine-type communication,maritime machine-type communication,VHF data exchange satellite system,Internet of Things,Marine vehicles,satellite communication,electromagnetic PFD mask concept,Space stations,ITU,Electronic Communications Committee,e-navigation,electronic data interchange,Maritime Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence,space communication links,maritime Internet of Things,radiofrequency interference,ITU spectrum allocation,electromagnetic power flux density mask concept,Satellite broadcasting,ECC,mathematical analysis,land system experiences,land mobile systems,Interference,International Telecommunication Union spectrum allocation,"

Assessments of the security of maritime shipping systems have focused on identifying risks but have not taken the critical (and expensive) next step of actually identifying vulnerabilities present in these systems. While such risk assessments are important, they have not provided the detailed identification of security issues in the systems that control these ports and their terminals.

"hierarchical maritime radio networks for internet of maritime things","2019","Despite the potential benefits of a maritime Internet of Things, a number of issues hinder its realization, including the need for wide area coverage and cost-effectiveness. Toward these needs, a model is first presented for uplink maritime radio communications that hierarchically employ Wi-Fi and cellular links for data transmission from marine user equipments (MUEs) on a ship to a cellular base station with distributed antennas (DAs) along a coastline. Then, the performances are evaluated given in terms of average data rate and outage probability in the hierarchical maritime radio networks. When evaluating the performances, heterogeneous channel characteristics of the hierarchical networks are taken into account in which Rayleigh fading is considered for the MUE-ship links, whereas shadowed-Rician fading is considered for the ship-DA links. Moreover, the effects due to various transmission errors that can be occurred at different communication layers are reflected in determining the quality of service (QoS) requirements of a ship. With the help of authors' analysis, an antenna selection algorithm is proposed under which the minimum size of a service cloud can be found to support the QoS requirements of MUEs with a ship.

"trial results conducted by multiple canadian government agencies of the recent covert technology developped by tektrap to trace and track the integrity of maritime containers worldwide","2012","iCargo is an easy-to-install miniature covert electronic device combining GPS and door lock tracking with wireless and satellite communications to remotely track the status and position of maritime containers worldwide. A system of strategically placed readers combined with satellite or cellular communications and redundant technologies ensures that security breaches are detected early and reliably anywhere along the supply chain. iCargo provides a GPS trace of where a container has travelled and where the container might have been opened. Deviations from the expected itinerary in time and/or distance are detected and the container can be flagged for physical inspection. Such a system helps borders authorities to focus their energy on suspicious cargo with the overall impact of speeding the flow of all cargo. iCargo uses a patented technique to convert the metal structure of the container into an antenna thereby allowing it to be installed behind the rubber seal of the door in a truly covert fashion. Other technologies are visible from the exterior and vulnerable to tampering and damage during container handling. The location within the door gasket is ideal for monitoring the door open/close status as well as for acting as a communications gateway to optional internal sensors. There are approximately 7 million maritime containers entering/leaving North America every year. The interiors of such containers are rarely inspected. Such containers may include contraband, hazmats, weapons or illegal items that present an economic or security risk. Despite significant security improvements since Sept-11th, only 5% of the maritime containers go through physical inspection. The use of the iCargo mounted on a container at the point of departure will assist government authorities in making better decisions about which containers to inspect thereby speeding up the overall throughput of all containers. In today's lean economy, goods in transit do not contribute to economic growth but instead are added costs to customers and shippers. With rising fuel and transportation costs, delays at borders are becoming increasingly expensive. Early detection via the iCargo system will help to reduce these costs by not only helping to shorten inspection delays but by also allowing officials to focus their energy on suspicious cargo thereby improving border security. Tektrap has been selected for the Pool of Pre-qualified Proposals for the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP). CICP is a very competitive program that targets recent innovations, especially in the field of national security, which are ready for the beta phase of product development. Within this award, iCargo will be evaluated during spring and early summer 2012 by Canada Border Services Agency for Canadian-US border application, by Defense Research and Development Canada, DND, for land, rail and air applications in the Canada Nordic environment, and by Transport Canada for trans-Canada land/rail and Asia-Canada sea conditions.

"compensation of antenna misalignment using selection diversity for maritime communications","2018","Communication is essential for coastal and rural areas, and providing an alternative method of communication for isolated coves through maritime communications is a way to cater that need. In order to create a reliable communication system, antenna misalignment attributed to wave motion of the sea must be accounted for because losses in transmission and reception occur. The scope of this study covers the angular variation of wave motion, particularly the roll angle tilting an antenna experiences. In this paper, improvements of using diversity techniques for a 2.4 GHz communication link in the maritime environment were investigated. In particular, spatial diversity, which uses independent multiple antennas to achieve a level of performance one antenna could not, was employed. The use of selection diversity, a type of spatial diversity that selects the antenna branch with the best signal strength, to compensate antenna misalignment is considered and analyzed. A transmitter and receiver front-end incorporating selection diversity were designed and implemented. Results prove that the use of the proposed scheme increase the overall gain of the communication link. There is an average of 1.35 dB and 5.3 dB increase for 2 and 3 antennas respectively, in using receive diversity compared to no diversity, and an average of 2.4 dB increase in using 3 antenna transmit diversity as opposed to no diversity, all of which were exposed to continuous tilting conditions. The presented plots exhibit a general trend showing that selection diversity reduces the received signal strength fluctuations to lower power, and minimizes the losses due to antenna misalignment.","antenna branch,transmitter front-end,receiving antennas,receiver front-end,Transmit Diversity.,antenna arrays,Selection Diversity,Sea measurements,Transmitting antennas,communication link,independent multiple antennas,selection diversity,antenna experiences,Testing,noise figure 2.4 dB,noise figure 5.3 dB,Maritime Communication,spatial diversity,frequency 2.4 GHz,receive diversity,diversity reception,transmitting antennas,roll angle tilting,antenna transmit diversity,wave motion,Receiving antennas,Antenna Misalignment,maritime environment,marine communication,antenna misalignment compensation,UHF antennas,Receive Diversity,maritime communications,"
"boom: bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy for cooperative maritime sensing","2023","With the advancements in sensing technologies, maritime sensing has become indispensable in various domains, including logistics, weather forecasting, and marine ranching. However, transmitting large volumes of sensing data faces many challenges in the maritime environment. Firstly, the transmissions purely depend on satellite links often costly and suffer from long propagation latency. On the other hand, traditional unicast transmission results in data duplication, wasting valuable marine communication resources. With the increasing density of sensing devices, the communication distance between maritime sensors has become closer, enabling the deployment of maritime opportunistic networks consisting of device-to-device links. Rather than using unicast transmission over satellite links, employing multicast with opportunistic routing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple destinations and saves communication resources. Even though the multicast method can avoid redundancy, conducting multicast without considering the maritime characteristics (i.e., the dynamics and the distribution of sensors) may lead to inefficient data delivery. Through real-world experiments, we observe that devices located on the edges of the network have a relatively low receiving rate compared with internal ones and tend to be the bottleneck of the overall multicast progress. Based on this observation, we propose BOOM, a bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy aiming at reducing multicast latency, taking into account the influence of the bottleneck node and broadcasting rate. Prominently, within maritime scenarios challenged by extreme conditions such as storms, typhoons, and tsunamis, BOOMâ€™s emphasis encompasses the adaptability of multicast strategies, which necessitates dynamic adjustments in response to equipment failures and shifts in network topology. Through mathematical analysis, we prove the formation of opportunistic multicast is an NP-hard problem and further design a heuristic algorithm based on the convex-hull method to reduce the computational cost in strategy generation. We compare BOOM with four other algorithms using real-world maritime vessel trajectories in various scenarios. The simulation result illustrates that the BOOM achieves a significant reduction in transmission latency, which reduces 36% when sensors are sparsely located in water areas, and the reduction could reach up to 59% when sensors are more dense. Furthermore, in extreme environmental testing conditions, BOOM continues to outperform other algorithms in terms of completion time, with performance improvements of up to 39% and 49% in sparse and dense topology environments respectively.","Data communication,Sensors,Task analysis,Maritime Sensing,Multicast Strategy,Marine vehicles,Satellite broadcasting,Wireless sensor networks,Opportunistic Multicast,Unicast,"
"modulation recognition in maritime multipath channels: a blind equalization-aided deep learning approach","2020","Modulation recognition has been long investigated in the literature, however, the performance could be severely degraded in multipath fading channels especially for high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals. This could be a critical problem in the broadband maritime wireless communications, where various propagation paths with large differences in the time of arrival are very likely to exist. Specifically, multiple paths may stem from the direct path, the reflection paths from the rough sea surface, and the refraction paths from the atmospheric duct, respectively. To address this issue, we propose a novel blind equalization-aided deep learning (DL) approach to recognize QAM signals in the presence of multipath propagation. The proposed approach consists of two modules: A blind equalization module and a subsequent DL network which employs the structure of ResNet. With predefined searching step-sizes for the blind equalization algorithm, which are designed according to the set of modulation formats of interest, the DL network is trained and tested over various multipath channel parameter settings. It is shown that as compared to the conventional DL approaches without equalization, the proposed method can achieve an improvement in the recognition accuracy up to 30% in severe multipath scenarios, especially in the high SNR regime. Moreover, it efficiently reduces the number of training data that is required.","novel blind equalization-aided deep learning approach,direct path,refraction paths,Blind equalizers,blind equalization,telecommunication computing,QAM signals,Machine learning,blind equalization algorithm,Feature extraction,Quadrature amplitude modulation,blind equalisers,maritime multipath channels,propagation paths,modulation recognition,time of arrival,deep learning,rough sea surface,quadrature amplitude modulation,multipath propagation,Multipath channels,high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation signals,multipath channels,recognition accuracy,multipath fading channels,severe multipath scenarios,blind equalization module,reflection paths,Modulation recognition,multipath channel parameter settings,multiple paths,marine communication,conventional DL approaches,broadband maritime,Task analysis,learning (artificial intelligence),fading channels,"
"cybersecurity in industrial control systems: issues, technologies, and challenges","2019","Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) play an important role in today’s industry by providing process automation, distributed control, and process monitoring. ICS was designed to be used in an isolated area or connected to other systems via specialised communication mechanisms or protocols. This setup allows manufacturers to manage their production processes with great flexibility and safety. However, this design does not meet today’s business requirements to work with state-of-the-art technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and big data analytics. In order to fulfil industry requirements, many ICSs have been connected to enterprise networks that allow business users to access real-time data generated by power plants. At the same time, this new design opens up several cybersecurity challenges for ICSs. We review possible cyber attacks on ICSs, identify typical threats and vulnerabilities, and we discuss unresolved security issues with existing ICS cybersecurity solutions. Then, we discuss how to secure ICSs (e.g., using risk assessment methodologies) and other protection measures. We also identify open security research challenges for ICSs, and we present a classification of existing security solutions along with their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide future research directions in ICS security.","Industrial control system,Threat detection and prevention,Risk management strategies,Cybersecurity in ICS,Vulnerability assessment,"

"cooperative collision avoidance study of maritime autonomous surface ship","2021","Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) with the advantage of advanced guidance, navigation, and control capabilities have attracted great attention in recent years. The MASS collect travelling information by the radar, camera, and Autonomous Identification System (AIS) with which it is equipped. Therefore, collision avoidance of MASS turns to be a cooperative and collaborative one by utilizing the interactive information efficiently and effectively. During the collision avoidance procedure of MASS, steering and deceleration are the common actions. In order to receive an efficient and reasonable steering angle and navigation time on the new course, a communication-based real time collaborative collision avoidance decision model is proposed. Firstly, a multi-level communication method is utilized to integrate dynamic information of surrounding vessels. Secondly, a real time collision risk analysis system for MASS is established based on fuzzy logic method. Finally, a collaborative collision avoidance decision system based on the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm is developed to find the optimal steering angle and sailing time on a new course. Comparative analysis about collision avoidance decision results are discussed in simulations.

The radar is designed as an omnidirectional radar and optimized for the balance of radar detection performance and communication performance. In maritime communication, the signal is often affected by narrow-band interference during transmission, which causes great damage to the communication quality. Aiming at this problem, a set of narrow-band interference cancellation algorithm combined with the integrated communication perception system is designed. This algorithm improves the classic threshold algorithm to achieve threshold adaptation. Finally, simulation shows the harm caused by narrow-band interference and the necessity of removing narrow-band interference.

"the regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on vdes","2023","In order to provide more collision avoidance information to ships that may encounter each other in dense sea areas, prevent collision events, and minimize channel data pressure, ensure network reliability and reduce latency, this paper proposes a regional protocol for local communications among maritime autonomous surface ships based on VDES (High Frequency Data Exchange System). Based on the theoretical foundation of the ship domain model in the field of ships, the area where collision danger exists is found by guiding the ship domain model, and this area is used as the routing flood area, and the routing request is limited to this area. The improved AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing forwarding algorithm is used to establish a communication link between ships in the routing request area using real-time location information. This can exchange more information with ships located in the collision risk area to assist in collaborative obstacle avoidance and prevent accidents. At the same time, it effectively avoids network-wide routing flooding, avoids network congestion, and ensures network stability. Simulation analysis shows that this protocol is superior to AIS in terms of delivery rate and delay on the basis of realizing business functions. This will be beneficial for obstacle avoidance between encountering ships.","channel data pressure,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,Delays,marine navigation,AODV routing protocol,regional protocol,communication link,routing protocols,high frequency data exchange system,ship field model,collision danger,collision risk area,Routing protocols,ships,marine safety,Stability criteria,collision avoidance information,network-wide routing flooding,telecommunication congestion control,mobile radio,Sea surface,routing request area,Collaboration,collaborative obstacle avoidance,collision events,dense sea areas,routing flood area,encountering ships,Routing,mobile robots,real-time location information,collision avoidance,ship domain model,VDES,local communications,network reliability,regional routing protocol,"

It is useful for supporting some activities in the sea, such as monitoring and surveillance, fishery, and exploration. Propagation characteristics in maritime environment is different from one in the land therefore needed to be studied more. One important aspect in maritime radio propagation is path loss caused by sea movement. Sea movement in the seas of Indonesia varies from smooth to rough according to Douglas sea scale. The rougher the sea movement, the severer the path loss that happens in radio propagation.

"measurements and analysis of maritime wireless channel at 8 ghz in the south china sea region","2023","This article presents the measurement results of maritime wireless propagation channel at 8 GHz in the South China Sea (SCS) region. Large-scale path loss (PL) and small-scale fading of channels between a marine observation platform and a moving vessel are investigated. For large-scale PL, comparisons are conducted among the free space model, the two-ray model, the parabolic equation model (PEM), and the log-distance model with the measured PL data. The results show that the log-distance model agrees well with the general trend of the measured data, whereas the PEM has a better ability to capture the variations of the interference nulls. In addition, the free space model and the two-ray model have larger deviation from the empirical data, implying that they are not suitable for the desired scenario. For small-scale fading, various distributions are considered to fit the fading. Based on the criteria of Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov statistics, the Rician distribution has the best goodness of fit, compared with the Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Welbull, or lognormal distributions.

"research into vessel behaviour pattern recognition in the maritime domain: past, present and future","2021","A comprehensive literature review on vessel behaviour pattern recognition in maritime and littoral environments, spanning a period of three decades, is presented. A vast majority of research focuses on anomalous vessel behaviour detection from Automated Identification System (AIS) data, using artificial intelligence (AI), Bayesian networks and machine learning based methods. AIS is a cooperative system that employs VHF transceivers to share vessel information through terrestrial and satellite communication networks. To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations.

"comparison of new technologies for data exchange in the maritime hf frequency band","2013","Recently, the use of HF radiotelex on ships, as the only terrestrial communication system for data exchange has been kept to a minimum, and the need for alternative systems, which would use the existing HF communication channels to exchange data between ships and end users on land, arose. Satellite communication systems represent the main aid for the exchange of large amounts of data with high transmission rates, but at high costs of equipment and services. Hence, there is the need to explore new, simpler and cheaper technologies for data exchange, which could be an alternative or a substitute for the existing radiotelex system. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the two systems, which could easily replace the existing maritime NBDP (Narrow-Band Direct Printing) telegraphy, has been done. One of the systems is based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) protocol, while the other, on the PACTOR-III protocol.

"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem.

The performed literary analysis of scientific sources of information confirms the significant lack of research aimed at the development of waterway infrastructure for unmanned ships. The study described in this paper is aimed at developing a design criterion that determines the possibility of using the waterway for the operation of autonomous ships. Data on the movement and density of ships for the waters of the Gulf of Finland according to the data of Automatic Identification System are presented. The analysis of vessel density in this work was carried out using the DBSCAN mathematical algorithm. It is proposed to use the concept and term 'knowledgeable' to include sections of the waterway in the zone of autonomous navigation. The involved experts assessed five criteria in terms of their significance: the availability of data on navigation on the selected section of the waterway, the availability of electronic navigation charts, the availability of hydrometeorological information, the availability of technical means of communication and navigational fencing. As a continuation of the research, it is proposed to study many qualitative and quantitative characteristics of both the area of the water area and the specialized equipment installed on it, since the operation of autonomous ships requires a more complex technical and information infrastructure.","knowledge of the water area,vessel traffic monitoring,DBSCAN,Autonomous navigation,maritime waterways,ships position clustering,automatic identification system,water transport system,expert system,"

"supporting maritime search and rescue missions through uas-based wireless localization","2018","The use of unmanned aircraft systems to support maritime search and rescue missions holds great potential. Applications range from the fast and efficient search of vessels and persons in distress to the provision of rescue and communication resources. In this paper, we address a received signal strength based localization method of persons without dedicated search and rescue equipment. The specific challenge addressed in this work is to analyze the proposed localization method under realistic conditions. Thus, a maritime channel model is implemented and by means of field tests experimentally validated. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated in a two step concept: In the first step the capability of different search patterns and localization algorithms is analyzed and evaluated in a hardware in the loop simulation environment. In the second step, a scaled experimental setup, which uses a technology comparable to cellular communications, is evaluated to prove the viability of the overall system. Besides the overall accuracy, the required localization time is a key performance indicator. The resulting outcome of the simulations using active trajectory generation underlines the potential of the discussed approach by achieving localization errors of lower than 200 m in under 10 mins.

"deep reinforcement learning based latency minimization for mobile edge computing with virtualization in maritime uav communication network","2022","The rapid development of maritime activities has led to the emergence of more and more computation-intensive applications. In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs).

To this aim, this paper puts forward long integration time techniques able to collect the signal energy over long time intervals (tens of seconds), allowing the retrieval of suitable levels of signal-to-disturbance ratios for detection purposes. A local plane based technique is first considered, providing target detection in a plane that represents the section of maritime area covered by the radar antenna.

"event processing in supply chain management – the status quo and research outlook","2019","Increasing supply chain complexity poses new challenges to managers. On the other hand, evolving information and communication technology offers ample opportunity for more reliable supply chain management practices. Event processing has established itself in many applications in logistics. Although the topic has enjoyed increasing popularity, there is no study taking stock of prior developments and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic literature review on the topic of event processing in supply chain management from 2005 until the present is undertaken. Extant literature is synthesized and analyzed from technological and supply chain management perspectives to inform scholars and practitioners of existing field developments. Additionally, to guide future scholarly endeavors, a research agenda is derived from promising topics raised in papers and unfulfilled practical requirements. We find that current solutions primarily focus on a limited number of supply chain core processes and a restricted number of supply chain actors. The majority of publications focused on time-temperature sensitive products. Additionally, the domination of road transportation can be observed, while other modes of transport are often ignored in solution implementations. Decision support in terms of object traceability within the supply chain is found in most articles. RFID, typically accompanied by the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, is the dominant enabling technology. Future research should focus on the topics of standardization, granularity, data sources, and cooperation. Moreover, holistic event processing supported by big data and machine learning techniques could create interfaces with other legacy business intelligence applications.

"resource management of maritime edge nodes for collected data feedback","2020","With the development of marine economy, more marine applications emerge leading to more deployed sensors and more generated data. However, current marine Internet only provides low transmission rate constrained by limited communication resources and bad transmission environment. How to efficiently use these resources and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) of applications need to be addressed. This paper proposes an online optimization resource management algorithm to improve the communication resource efficiency with guaranteed QoSs for different applications. This algorithm needs neither of the resource cost function nor QoS constraint function at the resource scheduling node. Furthermore, the gradient information, which is usually needed in learning strategies, is not required either. Instead, this algorithm performs resource management of both computation and communication resources in each time slot only based on the observation of the last time slot.

Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the goal of reducing communication cost while guaranteeing the delay-constraint of different applications.

A power budget analysis is detailed for Inmarsat signals, considering both the reference and the radar channels. The effect of sea clutter is also examined. It is shown that relatively poor range resolution can be improved if the available communication channels are combined to improve the bandwidth, a process that also improves the sensitivity.

"expanding maritime domain awareness capabilities in the arctic: high frequency radar vessel-tracking","2013","The arctic could be ice free during the summer by as early as 2040 [1]. This could alter the dominant shipping routes between Europe and Asia. The ability to monitor this traffic is hindered by lack of sensors, communication and power for the sensors. SeaSonde High Frequency radars were installed along the northwest corner of Alaska from July to December 2012. These radars were able to make simultaneous measurements of ocean surface currents as well as measure the position and velocity of vessels passing by the radar.

"cross-layer analysis of error control in underwater wireless sensor networks","2012","Several error control schemes have been introduced for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) to combat the effects of high error rates. However, these schemes have only been evaluated based on point-to-point communication metrics and do not consider the different underwater propagation phenomena. On the other hand, the unique properties of UWSNs such as the three-dimensional architecture and the underwater channel characteristics prevent existing studies of error control schemes for terrestrial sensor networks to be applied to this domain. In this paper, a cross-layer analysis framework is developed to evaluate existing error control techniques in three-dimensional multi-hop UWSNs. The developed framework captures the effects of automatic repeat request (ARQ), forward error correction (FEC), and hybrid ARQ schemes on end-to-end energy, latency, and packet error rate. In addition, different underwater propagation phenomena are considered with a particular attention on the presence of shadow zones. The theoretical analysis and the numerical evaluations reveal that exploiting FEC schemes with channel-aware routing reduces the end-to-end energy consumption and latency under all propagation phenomena for all water depths in UWSNs. The selection of the suitable error control scheme depends also on the water depth (shallow/deep water) and on the different underwater propagation phenomena.","Underwater networking,ARQ,Hybrid ARQ,Cross-layer analysis,FEC,"
"global navigation satellite systems performance analysis and augmentation strategies in aviation","2017","In an era of significant air traffic expansion characterized by a rising congestion of the radiofrequency spectrum and a widespread introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are being exposed to a variety of threats including signal interferences, adverse propagation effects and challenging platform-satellite relative dynamics. Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After designing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS + A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA).","Differential GNSS,High-integrity systems,Aerospace electronic systems,Air navigation,Avionics,Integrity monitoring,GNSS augmentation,Cyber-physical systems,Ground based augmentation system,Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring,Safety-critical aviation applications,Aircraft based augmentation system,Aviation security,GNSS performance,Global navigation satellite system,Satellite based augmentation system,"

SafeCOP will provide an approach to the safety assurance of CO-CPS, enabling thus their certification and development. The project will define a runtime manager architecture for runtime detection of abnormal behaviour, triggering if needed a safe degraded mode. SafeCOP will also develop methods and tools, which will be used to produce safety assurance evidence needed to certify cooperative functions. SafeCOP will extend current wireless technologies to ensure safe and secure cooperation, and also contribute to new standards and regulations, by providing certification authorities and standardization committees with the scientifically validated solutions needed to craft effective standards extended to also address cooperation and system-of-systems issues.

"a search strategy and vessel detection in maritime environment using fixed-wing uavs","2023","In this paper, we address the problem of autonomous search and vessel detection in an unknown GNSS-denied maritime environment with fixed-wing UAVs. The main challenge in such environments with limited localization, communication range, and the total number of UAVs and sensors is to implement an appropriate search strategy so that a target vessel can be detected as soon as possible. Thus we present informed and non-informed methods used to search the environment. The informed method relies on an obtained probabilistic map, while the non-informed method navigates the UAVs along predefined paths computed with respect to the environment. The vessel detection method is trained on synthetic data collected in the simulator with data annotation tools. Comparative experiments in simulation have shown that our combination of sensors, search methods and a vessel detection algorithm leads to a successful search for the target vessel in such challenging environments.","detection,target vessel,fixed-wing UAVs,unknown GNSS-denied maritime environment,Location awareness,MBZIRC,informed method,marine environment,Search problems,autonomous search,search methods,appropriate search strategy,satellite navigation,vessel detection method,noninformed method,Probabilistic logic,simulation,Annotations,autonomous aerial vehicles,search strategy,search problems,communication range,mobile robots,successful search,vessel detection algorithm,Computational modeling,Sensors,Navigation,fixed-wing UAV,"
"ai-empowered maritime internet of things: a parallel-network-driven approach","2020","As one of the key technologies for realizing a fully digitalized world, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ubiquitous connections across both land and sea. However, due to lack of infrastructure such as optical fibers and base stations, maritime communications inevitably face a highly complex and heterogeneous environment, which greatly challenges the connection reliability and traffic steering efficiency for future service-oriented maritime IoT. With the recent burgeoning application of artificial intelligence (AI) in many fields, an AI-empowered autonomous network for maritime IoT is envisioned as a promising solution. However, AI typically involves training/learning processes, which require realistic data/environment in order to obtain valuable outcomes. To this end, this article proposes the parallel network, which can be regarded as the 'digital twin' of the real network and is responsible for realizing four key functionalities: self-learning and optimizing, state inference and network cognition, event prediction and anomaly detection, and knowledge database and snapshots. We then explain how various AI methods can facilitate the operation of the parallel- network-driven maritime network. A case study is provided to demonstrate the idea. Research directions are also outlined for further studies.","maritime network,Internet of Things,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,traffic steering efficiency,network cognition,heterogeneous environment,Reinforcement learning,base stations,AI-empowered autonomous network,state inference,event prediction,ubiquitous computing,AI-empowered maritime Internet of Things,highly complex environment,service-oriented maritime IoT,Databases,computer network reliability,connection reliability,optical fibers,training-learning processes,knowledge database,parallel network,Complexity theory,marine communication,artificial intelligence,learning (artificial intelligence),ubiquitous connections,maritime communications,"
"securing iot based maritime transportation system through entropy-based dual-stack machine learning framework","2023","Internet of Things (IoTs) is envisaged to widely capture the realm of logistics and transportation services in future. The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named â€œDual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)â€ has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs). The proposed S2ML technique outperforms prevalent ones with 1.5% better results compared to asserted approaches on distribution of normal/attack traffic.

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"

"cognitive mimo sonar based robust target detection for harbor and maritime surveillance applications","2009","Robust detection of various hostile threats is vital to protect Navy ships and other facilities within harbor and maritime environments. Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) sonar transmits single acoustic waveform by single projector, which has a few disadvantages including low target detection probability, low resolution, vulnerability of interception by the enemy, sensitivity to jamming, etc. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), typically applied to communications and radar solutions, is an emerging technology that can be applied to sonar to overcome many of the SISO sonar disadvantages. In this paper, cognitive monostatic/bistatic/multistatic MIMO sonar approaches are proposed. MIMO sonar transmits different orthogonal acoustic waveforms from multiple projectors with different spatial distributions. Through space-time-waveform diversity, MIMO sonar is able to apply coherent processing techniques over the received signals, and acquires more diversity gains. The cognition concept proposed in the literature for radar and wireless communication is applied to MIMO sonar to improve its robustness and adaptability.

We focus on high robustness and generality with respect to variations of boat appearance, image quality, and environmental condition. A fusion of three different detection algorithms is performed to create reliable alarm hypotheses. In the following, a set of well-investigated features is extracted from the alarm hypotheses and evaluated using a two-stage-classification with support vector machines (SVMs) in order to distinguish between three object classes: clutter, irrelevant objects and suspicious boats.

"quality of service provisions for maritime communications based on cellular networks","2017","Considering the increase of communication requirements from marine users, more studies try to introduce terrestrial wireless communication techniques into maritime communications to improve communication qualities. However, different communication scenarios introduce challenges for the application of terrestrial techniques to maritime networks. Furthermore, the communication coverage requirement is much larger than that of terrestrial networks, while the quality of service (QoS) requirement of marine users is expected to be like that on land, which makes network design more complicated. To address these problems, a user-centric communication architecture based on distributed antennas is proposed for maritime communications. The scenario of coastal networks based on cellular techniques is modeled mathematically, based on which the performance of such a network is analyzed and closed-form expressions of network performance are presented. To guarantee the QoS requirements of users, an antenna selection scheme is proposed, which can form a virtual service cloud for a targeted user.
