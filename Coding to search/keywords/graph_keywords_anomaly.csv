"underwater archaeological investigation using ground penetrating radar: a case analysis of shanglinhu yue kiln sites (china)","2018","In this study we explored the possibility and effectiveness of applying ground penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate underwater cultural relics. Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake. Analysis of the Shanglinhu Lake data indicated that GPR is a superior tool for underwater archaeological investigation. Traditional methods including sonar, underwater cameras and salvage dives were used as supporting techniques in the study.","Underwater archaeological investigation,Ground penetrating radar,Yue kiln remains,"
"rare earth and trace elements of microbialites in upper jurassic coral- and sponge-microbialite reefs","2006","Major, trace (Y, Zr, Pb, Th and U), rare earth element (REE) and Sm–Nd isotope analyses were carried out on microbialites and detrital carbonate sediments collected in Upper Jurassic coral- and sponge-microbialite reef settings. Selected bioconstructions developed in various palaeogeographic settings and depositional environments on northwestern Tethys and eastern Atlantic margins: pure carbonate lagoon, carbonate-dominated deep shelf to epicontinental basin and mixed carbonate-siliciclastic shallow ramp and lagoon. The proximity to terrigenous sources directly controlled REE patterns of carbonate samples. Lateral and intra-reef sediments, and to a lesser degree stromatolitic microbial crusts, are more susceptible to contamination by terrigenous material than are microbialites of thrombolitic fabric. In mixed carbonate-siliciclastic settings, microbialites display a flat shale-normalized REE pattern. In pure carbonate lagoonal settings, microbialites have shale-normalized REE patterns similar to those of modern seawaters with a negative Ce anomaly [(Ce/Ce⁎) up to 0.14], positive La and Gd anomalies, and light REE depletion relative to heavy REE. These data imply that similar REE chemistry than modern seawater already occurred on the northwestern Tethys margin at the Upper Jurassic. Strong negative Ce anomalies (<0.4) imply microbialite formation in well-oxygenated seawaters both in coral reefs of pure carbonate lagoonal environments (Pagny-sur-Meuse) and sponge bioherms of deep-shelf settings (Plettenberg). Absence of positive Ce anomalies rules out an influence of alkaline and high-pH seawaters. Thus, REE patterns and Nd isotopic signatures, which are in perfect agreement with existing results for Tethysian seawater, confirm that microbialites can be used as proxies of palaeoenvironmental seawater chemical characteristics.","Rare earth elements,Coral and sponge reefs,Microbialites,Nd isotopes,Upper Jurassic seawater,Palaeoenvironment,"
"former el niño events: records from western south america","1993","The quasi-periodic alterations of the climate in South America and of the oceanographical conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean, referred to as the “El Niño” phenomenon, are part of a global anomaly in the ocean-atmosphere interactive system (the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, ENSO). As this phenomenon is responsible for the major interannual climatic variability and has a great potential to document links between the atmospheric and oceanic circulations, it is important to understand its mechanism, its boundary conditions and the causes of the variations of its intensity. Many answers to such questions can be sought in the historical and geological record of El Niño occurrences. Former impacts of the El Niño phenomenon along the western coast of South America are documented by remnants of catastrophic rainfalls and associated river floods, records of lake salinity variations, beach ridge sequences and numerous evidences of alterations in the biotic and physical coastal environment. For the last millennium or so, relatively precise (although discontinuous) archaeological and historical data are available. Continuous, high-resolution, proxy records are provided by glaciological data (last 1500 yr) from the Quelccaya ice cap of southern Peru and are potentially available from coral cores from the Galapagos Islands. No marine varves that would permit a detailed and sequential study of El Niño-related oceanographic anomalies during the late Quaternary have yet been obtained off western South America. The reconstruction of the sequence of the main ENSO events during the last millennia is thus hampered by the fact that there are too few continuous records and that these have not necessarily registered every El Niño occurrence and/or the relative intensity of each event. The discontinuous records of major El Niño events are more numerous, but often lack the required chronological accuracy. Obviously, both series of data need to be cross-checked and compared with information (e.g. dendroclimatology and marine varves) from other regions of the globe where climate teleconnections with the ENSO phenomenon can be assessed.",""
"role of rainfall intensity and urban sprawl in the 2014 flash flood in genoa city, bisagno catchment (liguria, italy)","2018","Flash floods are typical for the Mediterranean region, however they have been recurring at increasing frequency over the past few decades especially over the Italian Peninsula. The region of Genoa has recently moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous flash floods of the Bisagno River and its tributaries as a result of intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011 and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects of the Bisagno River flash flood of October 9th, 2014 in the city of Genoa. Application of a Standard Anomaly Index and a Cluster Analysis reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded in the Bisagno Valley for the period of 1945–2016. Urban sprawl in the catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding Genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land use change, including in particular transformations of the Bisagno riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen observatory for early warning of flash floods.","Urban sprawl,Italy,Flash flood risk,Rainfall regime variations,Mediterranean area,Genoa,"
"multiocular surveilance of wide dynamic environments based on optical vision, event modelling and end-to-end data encryption: a cloud-based monitoring approach of maritime activities","2012","The success of contemporary surveillance systems depends on their cost and their ability to automatically and correctly interpret events that take place in an observed environment. Correct decisions enhance the situation awareness of an operator, while wrong ones lead to false or no alarms, damaging the system's credibility.

The focus of our current work is to present the system's overall architecture and discuss in detail the design and functionalities of its main modules: (a) the multiocular network of multispectral cameras for visual information gathering, (b) the intelligent segmentation, event modeling and anomaly detection module and (c) the end-to-end power-aware data encryption infrastructure.

"chapter 4 - the baltic sea","2019","The Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish seas in the world with a total surface area of 415,240km2 (including the Danish Straits and Kattegat) with water volume of 21,706km3. Its environmental conditions depend on the hydrological processes in the catchment area, meteorological forcing, oceanographic processes in the sea, and the interactions between these. The water body of the central Baltic is permanently stratified, with an upper layer of low-salinity (6–8psu) water and a more saline (10–14psu) deepwater layer, both separated by a strong halocline. Strong environmental gradients create a variety of habitats with different biota in different subbasins. Due to its young age and reduced salinity the biological structure of the Baltic Sea is relatively restricted. Low species richness is often associated with strong dominance of a few species and high productivity. Being a semienclosed sea surrounded by densely populated and highly industrialized countries, the Baltic Sea is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressure. Currently, the major threats to the Baltic Sea are chemical contamination, eutrophication, and hypoxia. Therefore, anthropogenic pressure along with related climate change should be taken into account for assessment of the environmental status of the Baltic Sea and its future changes.","Stratified system,Brackish water,Eutrophication,Density anomaly,Environmental gradients,"
"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper. In order to complete the online real-time detection of ship abnormal behavior with multivariate and multidimensional time series, improve the accuracy of ship abnormal behavior detection and reduce the blind area of VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) system monitoring.","ship abnormal behavior monitoring,VTS system,sea environment set,graph attention network,multivariate time series,graph neural network,Marine vehicles,neural nets,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,VTS system monitoring,multidimensional time series,sliding window,Data models,object detection,vessel traffic service,Time series analysis,existing maritime intelligent supervision,online real-time detection,Real-time systems,graph theory,time series,ship abnormal behavior detection method,Trajectory,maritime supervision,fixed data input generation,Cognition,traffic engineering computing,ship abnormal behavior detection,abnormal behavior characteristics,ship behavior characteristics,"
"geographic context configuration in fusion algorithms for maritime surveillance","2014","Real fusion system applications can be required to operate on wide areas for long periods of time. Adaptation is a basic capability under these circumstances. This paper presents a maritime surveillance platform designed to be flexible and robust. It features online configuration capabilities allowing to: (a) change the applied algorithms, (b) modify the operating parameters of the running algorithms, (c) tune the characterization of the available sensors. These configurations can be applied to limited spatial regions and time spans. This allows to use powerful or more specific configurations for localized scenarios (risks, clutter, alarms), or account for exceptional situations that can affect sensors, such as weather anomalies.","fusion system,adaptive fusion,search radar,sensor fusion,quality metrics,marine radar,Radar tracking,Sensors,Context,Algorithm design and analysis,Surveillance,fusion algorithms,weather anomalies,geographic context configuration,Program processors,context-aided fusion,maritime surveillance,"
"an overview of cawses-india program with emphasis to equatorial atmospheric coupling processes","2012","This paper presents an overview of CAWSES—India program, highlighting some of the Indian coordinated efforts to understand the Sun−Earth system as a whole, with special emphasis to the equatorial and low latitude phenomena. Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Under the theme of ‘Solar Influence on Atmospheric Climate’, a study has been made on the effects of solar variability on middle atmosphere using satellite data and model simulations, highlighting the significant differences between them.","Ionosphere,Magnetosphere,CAWSES,Stratosphere–troposphere,Solarwind,Mesosphere,Thermosphere,"
"40 years of changes in sea surface temperature along the western iberian coast","2023","Climate change is causing mean sea surface temperatures (SST) to increase worldwide. However, this increase has not been temporally or spatially uniform, with variations observed depending both on the period considered and the geographic region. In this context, this paper aims to quantify relevant changes in SST along the Western Iberian Coast over the last four decades, through the calculation of trends and anomalies of long-term time series of in situ observations and satellite-derived data. Potential drivers of SST changes were considered using atmospheric and teleconnections time series. Changes in the seasonal cycle of SST were also evaluated. We show that SST has increased since 1982, with regional variations between 0.10 and 0.25 °C per decade, with an increase in air temperature appearing to drive the SST trends along the Iberian coast. In the near-shore area, no significant trends or changes in the seasonal cycle of SST were observed, which is likely due to a buffer effect caused by the seasonal upwelling that characterizes the region. Recent decades show a slowdown in the increase rate of SST along the Western Iberian Coast. An upwelling intensification could justify this observation, along with the effect of teleconnections on the regional climate, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation Index (WeMOI). Our results suggest that the WeMOI plays a more important role in coastal SST variability than the other teleconnections. The present study quantifies regional changes in SST and enhances knowledge of the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in regulating climate and weather conditions. Moreover, it provides a relevant scientific context to the development of regional adaptative and mitigation actions in response to climate change.","Ocean-atmosphere interactions,Rising temperatures,Buffer effect,Trends,Seasonality variability,Climate change,Anomalies,"

"meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest asia: the role of pressure anomaly and inter-tropical convergence zone on the 1–3 july 2014 case","2015","The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1–3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","MSLP anomalies,SW Asia,ITCZ position,Dust storm,Karakum desert,Vertical dust distribution,"
"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","Underwater glider,Variational autoencoder,Marine autonomous system,Anomaly detection,Long short-term memory network,"
"graph representation learning with encoding edges","2019","Network embedding aims at learning the low dimensional representation of nodes. These representations can be widely used for network mining tasks, such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and classification. Recently, a great deal of meaningful research work has been carried out on this emerging network analysis paradigm. The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","Edge representation,Feature learning,Network mining,Network embedding,"
"fault diagnosis of regenerative thermal oxidizer system via dynamic uncertain causality graph integrated with early anomaly detection","2023","Regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTO) serve as pivotal equipment for the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, a diversity of faults of the RTO system may threaten personnel safety and lead to unscheduled downtime. In this work, we develop a traceability inference method based on dynamic uncertain causality graph (DUCG) to identify root fault cause of RTO at early anomaly alarm. A general expert knowledge base for the fault diagnosis of RTO system is constructed. And the anomaly alarm thresholds are modified according to historical data with n-sigma rules to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Results on different cases show advantages in both triggering early anomaly alarms and avoiding invalid alarms, which is crucial to improve the fault inference accuracy. By applying our method to 35 fault cases of a real RTO for pharmaceutical VOCs treatment, the fault detection rate reaches 94.29%, and the fault inference accuracy is 82.86%. The two scores are 3% and 21% higher than those with the conventional DUCG (with fixed alarms), respectively. This remarkable improvement underlines the significance of our proposed method for RTO maintenance, and it is expected to assure the system’s operational stability and reliability.","Anomaly detection,Regenerative thermal oxidizer,Dynamic uncertain causality graph,Fault diagnosis,"
"mediterranean tropical-like cyclones: impacts and composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic patterns","2018","In the Mediterranean region, a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by gale winds, severe precipitation, and low pressure center, accompanied with a spiral pattern of thunderstorms, is occasionally observed. These tropical-like cyclones (TLC), known as Medicanes or Mediterranean ‘hurricanes’, have similar characteristics with hurricanes and a significant amount of research has been done in recent years to investigate their atmospheric characteristics and impacts. The Laboratory of Climatology and Atmospheric Environment (LACAE), National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, has established a systematic effort since 2009, to document the impact of severe atmospheric phenomena (e.g. medicanes, cyclones, tornadoes, waterspouts), especially over the eastern Mediterranean region. The objective of this study is to discuss on one hand, the intra annual and inter annual distribution of medicanes along with the composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic conditions and instability indices at the middle and lower troposphere, sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) as well, during medicane days, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data sets. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of medicane impacts over Mediterranean region with respect to period from 1969 to 2014, is illustrated by utilizing the Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The findings shed light on the high activity of medicanes during autumn and winter with maxima in September, decreasing thereafter with a long tail extending in spring and minimizing in summer. The average number of the selected medicanes is 1.4±1.3 events per year while their inter-annual variability is remarkable, although there is not any statistically significant trend (95% confidence level) within the examined period. We found from the analysis of the composite daily anomalies of the synoptic conditions that medicanes initiate and further develop in Mediterranean regions where cold air intrusions appear in the upper atmosphere associated with warm sea waters. Last but not least, the impacts of medicanes over coastal areas, including infrastructure damage and casualties due to associated strong winds, heavy rainfall, and in rare cases, tornadoes, are well presented, indicating the high concern of such extreme atmospheric phenomena should be given by stake holders towards resilience of the society.","Tropical-like cyclones,Medicanes,Mediterranean,NCEP-NCAR reanalysis,Composite means and anomalies,Impacts,"
"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems.","recurrent neural nets,Safety,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Mathematical model,safety management,movement prediction,AIS dataset,Predictive models,curvilinear method,ubiquitous computing,deep neural networks,CLSTM network,ship behavior,deep learning,ships,automatic identification system dataset,marine safety,marine engineering,Data models,contextual hybrid model,contextual information,vessel movement prediction,United States of America,geographic context,data compression,Automatic identification system,vessel types,Trajectory,compressed trajectory estimation,context-aware LSTM network,vessel route planning,Deep learning,Context modeling,context-aware long short-term memory network,logical consistency,context-aware trajectories simplification,"
"spatiotemporal variability in bio-optical characteristics of the southwestern tropical indian ocean during boreal summer: biophysical influences","2022","The bio-optical characteristics of the surface ocean play a pivotal role in radiative transfer and photosynthetic carbon fixation. To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photoacclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by integrating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant relationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO. The in situ Chl-a, aph(443), adg(443), Kd(490) and C¯ pd were used to validate the various empirical algorithms available as well as the satellite-retrieved data. The MODIS and VIIRS data correlated moderately. This study would help towards improving regional optimized algorithms for OAS and provide a baseline understanding of the scale of variability of primary production and carbon flux from space. In addition, this would contribute valuable bio-optical data from an under-sampled geographical area.","Subsurface stratification,Light absorption,Tropical Indian Ocean,Particulate backscattering,Deep chlorophyll maxima,Phytoplankton pigments,"
"diagnosis of a high-impact secondary cyclone during hymex-sop1 iop18","2020","Multiple high-impact weather events occurred during HyMeX-SOP1, which was intensively monitored by a large number of ordinary and extraordinary observations. The availability of special observations offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore these events in depth and assess the capabilities of current numerical weather prediction tools. In this case, a small-scale secondary cyclone formed within a prominent cyclone that intensified in the north-western part of the western Mediterranean during IOP18 on October 31, 2012. The small secondary system formed near Catalonia, where heavy rain was observed, and then moved to the northern part of the island of Minorca, producing very strong winds. Finally, the secondary cyclone moved northeast while merging with the main cyclone and evolving as a cyclonic perturbation towards the Gulf of Genoa, bringing heavy precipitation to some Italian regions. This work aims at providing a detailed diagnosis of the genesis and evolution of the secondary cyclone, using high-resolution numerical tools. Furthermore, with the main objective of identifying the main physical mechanisms involved in the genesis and evolution of the small-scale secondary cyclone, sensitivity experiments were performed taking into account three main factors: latent heat release, upper-level dynamical forcing and topographical effects. Results show that in terms of individual cyclogenetic contributions, the upper level PV anomaly contribution dominated the initial phase and the diabatic heating from condensation contributed to the further deepening during the later stages of the secondary cyclone. The initial dynamical effect from the upper-levels forcing was amplified by the local topographic features, becoming a key synergistic factor for the formation of the damaging secondary cyclonic system.","Secondary cyclone,Mediterranean,High-impact event,HyMeX,Factor separation,Potential vorticity inversion,"
"spatial ontologies for detecting abnormal maritime behaviour","2012","The upsurge in piracy and the impact of recent environmental disasters have highlighted the need to improve maritime surveillance. Governmental and private initiatives have developed monitoring systems with improved acquisition and analysis capabilities.

However, the quantity of data, the complexity of situations, the failure to take into account their spatial characteristics and the potential for the same scenario to be interpreted in different ways have proved to be significant problems.

"grid size optimization for potential field based maritime anomaly detection","2014","This study focuses on improving the potential field based maritime data modeling method, developed to extract traffic patterns and detect anomalies, in a clear, understandable and informative way. The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters). The effective outcome of the potential filed based anomaly detection is filtering out all vessels behaving normally and presenting a set of anomalies, for a subsequent incident analysis using STRAND as an information visualization tool.","maritime traffic,potential field,anomaly detection,AIS,"
"mining vessel tracking data for maritime domain applications","2016","The growing number of remote sensing systems and ship reporting technologies (e.g. Automatic Identification System, Long Range Identification and Tracking, radar tracking, Earth Observation) are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to vessels and their movements. Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential to the discovery of knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data.

The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge. This work will provide a survey of the recent JRC research activities relevant to automatic anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in the maritime domain.

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"
"potential impact of long-life environmental sonobuoys on littoral asw","2009","The focus of military activity has recently shifted from large area engagements to regional conflicts. Consequently, supportive Naval maritime operations have continued to evolve toward littoral warfare in complicated shallow-water, near-shore environments. This evolution requires new sensors, advanced Concept of Operations, and improved data-analysis capabilities, among others. Planning operations in these harsh-environment areas is difficult because accurate predictions of tactical sensor performance depend on detailed knowledge of the local environmental conditions. Tactical mission planning is thus seldom optimal or efficient, often resulting in coverage gaps, increased risk, and reduced mission success. According to a Navy Mission Need Statement, 'Air ASW tactical execution, especially in littoral seas, requires in-situ environmental updates for preflight mission planning. In the conduct of ASW operations, an urgent need for explicit knowledge of environmental variables is required to optimize the effectiveness of operational acoustic sensors, as well as acoustic sensors in development ' The Naval Air Systems Command has considered extended-life environmental sonobuoy concepts to better characterize the littoral environment. Most designs contain a thermistor string to measure ocean temperatures and also hydrophones to measure ambient noise. This type of complex sonobuoy would be more expensive than a traditional single-measurement AXBT but it could provide a more thorough littoral environment assessment. This paper examines the trade-off between increased sensor complexity and improved ASW performance, in terms of cumulative detection probability. Some advantages of an extended-life combined thermistor string/hydrophone approach, compared to AXBTs and tactical hydrophones, are: 1) higher accuracy of the raw data; 2) temporal averaging to smooth out fluctuations; 3) extended area coverage during drift; 4) less chance for surface temperature anomalies (e.g., mixed-layer-depth errors) caused by various electronic and mechanical variability upon impact; 5) opportunities to discover thermal and acoustic feature boundaries during drift; and 6) less need to re-seed thus allowing longer tactical mission times. These advantages are evaluated relative to the following disadvantages: 1) increased cost; 2) potential drift outside the mission area; and 3) need for increased battery life for longer durations. The analysis is tempered by considering how a potential new system might be used. One assumption is that an environmental sampling decision aid is available to determine the minimum number and best initial locations of drifting sensors to meet performance objectives. The November 2007 Requirements Document from the Naval Oceanographic Office states ?Sampling guidance: Development of guidance on the best way to deploy, spatially and temporally, observation systems in order to meet various forecasting, model assimilation, and model evaluation objectives is needed.? Work in this area is reported in this Oceans '09 Conference in a paper entitled ?Uncertainty-based Adaptive AXBT Sampling with SPOTS?, which addresses optimal sampling requirements. For this trade-off analysis, temperature data from watersampling flights in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of Korea were used to simulate expected capability of a long-term drifting thermistor string. Then optimal initial positions for three notional buoys were determined followed by a simulation of drifting positions and data collected over 12 days. Ocean nowcasts were constructed and used to determine acoustic performance of a notional tactical sonobuoy field. The analysis shows that a drifting extended-life thermistor string can provide significant improvement in environmental characterization, tactical planning, and ASW detection performance.","Acoustic measurements,Sea measurements,military systems,Predictive models,Sonar equipment,Sampling methods,Ocean temperature,Noise measurement,littoral ASW,operational acoustic sensors,Thermistors,Temperature measurement,Acoustic sensors,long-life environmental sonobuoys,"
"twelve years of geophysical research in the charlevoix seismic zone","1988","Various and extensive geophysical monitoring began in 1974 in the Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ). The historical record and a major earthquake in 1925 characterize this zone as the likely site of a future damaging earthquake (i.e. M = 5.5 or larger) and the aim of the monitoring was to develop the capability of predicting such earthquakes. The parameters studied included: microseismicity, seismic travel times, electrical impedance, vertical movement, horizontal movement, tilt, gravity change, and strain through water well level changes. Although no clear precursor was detected in the months before the largest seismic event that occurred during the observation period (M = 5.0), the multiparameter experiment provided new insights into the structure and the mechanics of this active region. Observations of several hundred well-located microearthquakes have permitted the delineation of ancient rift faults that are now being activated by high horizontal compression. The geographical extent of the zone is sharply defined by the microseismicity which occurs in an area of 35 km × 80 km straddling the St. Lawrence River. Observation of P-waves from accurately-timed explosions and S-waves from earthquakes support the hypothesis of Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy (EDA) involving saturated parallel cracks in the crust. The data have permitted an estimate of both crack density and the direction for the principal compressive stress in the region (N 30° E). Changes in electrical parameters with periods of months to years were detected at five of the six magnetotelluric stations installed in the region. Changes in the polarization angle of the earth's electrical (telluric) field correlated well (for seven years) with calculated groundwater accumulation levels at one site. Electric impedance changes showed no clear correlation from station to station, but changes at one station appear to correlate with a seismic P-wave travel time change anomaly and with the disappearance of a negative gravity anomaly at the time of an unusual number of earthquakes in the range M = 2 to 3 from mid 1976 to mid 1977. It is suggested that these correlated changes could be related to aseismic stress redistribution and fluid flow along one of the NE striking rift faults about two years before theM = 5.0 earthquake in 1979. Continuous monitoring of tilt (surface and borehole) and well-water levels was carried out at a single site (Charlevoix Geophysical Observatory). Although there were unexplained near-surface tilts of the order of the earth tide amplitude within two or three days before some earthquakes, they were either not spatially coherent or were related to small unexplained temperature changes in the tiltmeter vault. No intermediate-term (one week to one year) precursors were seen against a noise level of 1–3 μrad (RMS) for near-surface tilt observations and a noise level of 0.2–0.3 μrad (RMS) for borehole tilt measurements at a depth of 50–100 m. The threshold of detectable tidal tilt admittance changes for the borehole tiltmeters was lowered to 2% but no significant changes were seen. Four coseismic changes in the levels of water in boreholes were observed (all were drops in water level) which were much larger than expected on the basis of elastic dislocation theory. It is suggested that these could be explained either by the collapse of a dilatant zone around the respective hypocentres or by triggered aseisnuc movement on a nearby active fault. Borehole water level tides observed from 1980 to 1986 exhibit significant variations in amplitude and phase which are thought to be the result of time-varying elastic properties in a nearby structure. Some constraints can now be placed on the long-term deformation of the CSZ as a whole from tiltmeter, levelling and horizontal surveys. Data from a levelling array observed from 1976 to 1986 puts a limit of 0.54 μ rad/yr on the secular tilt rate at the observatory: a further limit of 0.1 μ rad/yr is provided by borehole tilt measurements over the period 1983–1986. A limit of 2 cm is placed on vertical movements northwest of the St. Lawrence River by levelling surveys in 1965, 1978, 1980 and 1982. No significant (90% confidence) deviatoric strain has been detected across the CSZ from horizontal control surveys carried out in 1912–1919, 1965, 1978 and 1983: the maximum allowable long-term strain rate across the CSZ from 1919 to 1983 is 0.16 μ strain/yr.",""
"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"
"measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","2021","The paper presents the partial work done within the framework of the EDA Siramis II project focused on magnetic signature reproduction of ships. Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","Sea measurements,Magnetic anomaly detection,Magnetic variables measurement,Magnetic signatures,Model checking,Electromagnetic modelling,Marine vehicles,Magnetic fields,"
"permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal uav-based infrared and visible images","2020","This work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities/voids located within two harbour quays in Le Havre Harbourg, Normandy, France. An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","Thermal infrared,Photogrammetry,Remote Sensing,infiltration,Subsurface cavity,Natural hazards,UAV,"
"soil anomaly mapping using a caesium magnetometer: limits in the low magnetic amplitude case","2006","Caesium magnetometers are new tools for soil property mapping with a decimetric resolution [Mathé, V., Lévêque, F., 2003. High resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 212 (1–2), 241–251]. However, when the magnetic anomalies are only a few nanoteslas (nT), the geologic and pedogenic signal must first be isolated from magnetic disturbances for this method to be useful. This paper investigates the instrumental artifacts and environmental disturbances to adapt the survey protocol to slightly magnetic soils. Among the possible instrumental sources of disturbances listed and quantified, the most significant are: 1) The battery effect upon sensors 2 m away (classic protocol, about ±0.15 nT) while increasing this distance up to 10 m cancelled it; 2) The noise level of magnetometers and sensors, which, according to tests on two magnetometers and three sensors, rarely and randomly exceeds 0.1 nT, but seems to increase with the electronic component age. Among the environmental disturbances, temporal variations such as diurnal variation or fluctuations linked to the moving of metallic masses play a major role, although the pseudogradient or base-station methods have commonly cancelled them. The efficiency of the latter is strongly dependent on the source nature. However, the ground currents and electromagnetic fields propagating in soils cause more problems. As a first step to better understand such disturbance sources, uncommon magnetic signal variations supposedly due to electromagnetic wave conversions and likely linked to the railway traffic are presented. Based on previous results, an adapted protocol using one magnetometer and two caesium sensors (0.3 and 1.6 m above the surface) is proposed to increase the signal/noise ratio. At first, to maintain an accurate horizontal and vertical location of the sensors, the latter are affixed to a wooden handcart running on plastic rails. Rails adapt to micro-topography, thereby decreasing strongly the soil–sensors distance variations. Anomalies due to topography rarely exceed 0.1 nT. Finally, a method to remove diurnal variations from high-resolution magnetic maps is proposed. Parallel profiles performed successively are adjusted by a cross-profile. Assuming that the temporal variations during each profile are negligible (less than 0.05 nT), this technique, contrary to the pseudogradient, preserves both the decimetric and the metric anomalies (gain of more than 1 nT).","Marshland soils,Survey protocol,Caesium magnetometer,High-resolution magnetic survey,Seismomagnetic wave conversions,"
"traffic pattern detection using the hough transformation for anomaly detection to improve maritime domain awareness","2014","Techniques for extracting traffic patterns from ship position data to generate atlases of expected ocean travel are developed in this paper. An archive of historical data is used to develop a traffic density grid. The Hough transformation is used to extract linear patterns of elevated density from the traffic density grid, which can be considered the â€œhighwaysâ€ of the oceans. These highways collectively create an atlas that is used to define geographical regions of expected ship locations. The atlas generation techniques are demonstrated using automated information system (AIS) ship position data to detect highways in both open-ocean and coastal areas. Additionally, the atlas generation techniques are used to explore variability in ship traffic as a result of extreme weather. The development of an automatic atlas generation technique that can be used to develop a definition of normal maritime behavior is a significant result of this research.","Traffic control,historical data archive,highway detection,Pattern Extraction,geographical regions,automatic atlas generation technique,cartography,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,maritime domain awareness,traffic density grid,geography,AIS ship position data,Meteorology,Hough transformation,normal maritime behavior,ships,Maritime Domain Awareness,marine engineering,Hough Transformation,Hough transforms,Oceans,traffic information systems,traffic pattern extraction,coastal area,automated information system ship position data,linear pattern extraction,traffic pattern detection,Road transportation,Market research,ship traffic,image processing,Data mining,ocean travel,open-ocean area,Automated Information System,"

Conventionally, Origin-Destination matrix data is utilized for event detection which has limitations such as removal of temporal aspect of data and inability to access to trajectory features such as speed of vessel from origin to destination. To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval. We further propose Graph Network Deviation Detector (GNDD), which leverages graph embedding and context embedding techniques to capture anomalies in the spatio-temporal patterns of movement.

"turia river delta and coastal barrier-lagoon of valencia (mediterranean coast of spain): geomorphological processes and global climate fluctuations since iberian-roman times","2019","Extensive drillings and 31 new C-14 datings were used to establish the geomorphological evolution of the Turia river delta and coastal barrier-lagoon system of Valencia (Spain) over the last three millennia. Integration of geomorphological, stratigraphic, malacological, sedimentological and geoarchaeological data enables us to relate river Turia avulsions and alluvial episodes to the development of coastal spits and barriers. Geomorphological changes in the study area may also be associated with global climate events, sea-level fluctuations or anthropogenic periods in the Turia catchment. Six phases may be differentiated: (1) a major early alluviation phase during the Iberian period, when the Turia river ran to the north of the coastal plain and sand spits closed the Valencia open lagoon environments, forming a permeable barrier (2800 BP to 2300 BP approximately); (2) an avulsion phase of the Turia river to the south at the end of the Roman period (4th century AD); (3) formation of a more advanced spit just behind the most recent barrier during the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA, Visigothic period); (4) a flood period of high-magnitude with coarser sediments throughout the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 11th century AD), when La Punta meridional deltaic ridge developed, which can be related to beach ridge closing and marine isolation of the Valencia lagoon around the 12th century; (5) important river alluviation and growth of the recent coastal barrier favoured by Turia channel changes during the Middle Ages, in the early Little Ice Age (LIA); (6) rapid coastal progradation and decline in salinity in the Valencia lagoon between the Maunder sunspot minimum (MM) and the end of LIA.","River avulsions,Western Europe,Mediterranean,Coastal geomorphology,Holocene,Paleoclimatology,"
"heat, salt and volume transports by eddies in the vicinity of the luzon strait","2012","The heat, salt and volume transports by oceanic meso-scale eddies generated near the Luzon Strait and moving into the South China Sea (SCS) are estimated by combining satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature (SST) data with hydrographic data. By establishing a statistical relationship among steric height, SST and subsurface temperature, together with a multi-grid 3D-Var assimilation method, an eddy-resolving temperature/salinity dataset from 1993 to 2008 is reconstructed from the altimetry sea surface height (SSH) anomaly, remote sensing SST and historical temperature/salinity profiles in the SCS. Using two cases of eddies in the reconstructed temperature/salinity dataset, we show that a cyclonic eddy can carry negative heat anomaly with −6.7±2.5×1018J, which contributes to the heat balance of the region where it travels through, and freshwater of 0.0005±0.0002Sv into the SCS, and that an anti-cyclonic eddy can transport positive heat anomaly with 4.6±1.8×1018J, which might have affected the inteannual variation of heat in the upper layer of the SCS and bring freshwater of 0.0004±0.0001Sv into the SCS on top of the 26.5σθ isopycnal surface. The 16-year averaged heat, salt and volume transports by meso-scale eddies near the Luzon Strait are estimated as 0.00003±0.00001PW, 0.004±0.001×106kgs−1 and 0.3Sv into the SCS on top of the 25.0σθ isopycnal surface. During the 16-year period, these transports show significant interannual variations.

"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"
"reasons behind seasonal and monthly precipitation variability in the qinghai-tibet plateau and its surrounding areas during 1979∼2017","2023","The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a hotspot in the study of global climate change due to its profound impact on the atmospheric water cycle in Asia and even the world. Previous studies on the QTP mainly focused on the spatial distribution of precipitation and its changing trend. To investigate the temporal and spatial variations of precipitation variability on the QTP, this study applied the standardized variability index (SVI) based on entropy on its daily precipitation without any preset distribution. The results showed that for most monsoon months in the past 40 years, SVI has a significant downward trend in the southwest foot of the Himalayas and the border zone between barren and grassland areas, indicating that precipitation has become more uniform, which is beneficial for growth of grassland. However, the Hurst exponent shows that such trend will reverse in the future, which may cause natural disasters such as landslides and debris flows in the monsoon period considering the large amount of precipitation and the local topographic conditions in the southwest of the Himalayan foothills. The inducements of such precipitation variability were also studied, including Asian monsoon, westerly jets, sea-land thermal difference, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Compared with the monsoon index, the sea-land thermal difference has a stronger correlation with the precipitation variability. The SST anomaly closer to the east coast of the equatorial Pacific also has a great impact on the variability of precipitation over the plateau. This study contributes to understanding precipitation variability in the QTP at a sub-seasonal period.","Entropy,Standardized variability index (SVI),Seasonal/Monthly precipitation variability,Influencing factors on precipitation variability,Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,"
"spatio-temporal variability of oceanographic conditions in the exclusive economic zone of cuba","2020","In this work we assessed the spatio-temporal variability of the oceanographic conditions in the period 1998–2017 in four sectors of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Cuba, referred to as the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast sectors (i.e., NWS, NES, SWS and SES, respectively). We relied upon remote-sensing observations of wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration along with model predictions of mixed layer depth (MLD), nitrate concentration and net primary production (NPP). We found evidence of the spatially heterogeneous oceanographic conditions of the EEZ of Cuba, since the analysed variables fluctuated spatially with meridional and zonal gradients. Overall, the southern sectors were warmer and less productive than the northern ones, thereby showing the influence of the Caribbean Sea. The NWS showed the highest variability of the physical and biological variables analysed, given the convergence of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico waters and the Loop Current variability. The NES was strongly influenced by coastal conditions given its limited area and long coast line. Besides, a significant decadal increase in SSHA was linked to that in SST. Still, this warming trend was not reflected in the chl-a concentration and NPP trends, which is consistent with the fact that there has been no change over the studied 20 years in mean wind regime and MLD. Furthermore, the strong El Niño Southern Oscillation events of 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 appear to have considerably impacted the surface chl-a concentration, which was partially governed by the variability of the MLD.","Remote sensing,Exclusive Economic Zone of Cuba,Trends,Oceanographic conditions,"

"spectral anomaly methods for aerial detection using kut nuisance rejection","2015","This work discusses the application and optimization of a spectral anomaly method for the real-time detection of gamma radiation sources from an aerial helicopter platform. Aerial detection presents several key challenges over ground-based detection. For one, larger and more rapid background fluctuations are typical due to higher speeds, larger field of view, and geographically induced background changes. As well, the possible large altitude or stand-off distance variations cause significant steps in background count rate as well as spectral changes due to increased gamma-ray scatter with detection at higher altitudes. The work here details the adaptation and optimization of the PNNL-developed algorithm Nuisance-Rejecting Spectral Comparison Ratios for Anomaly Detection (NSCRAD), a spectral anomaly method previously developed for ground-based applications, for an aerial platform. The algorithm has been optimized for two multi-detector systems; a NaI(Tl)-detector-based system and a CsI detector array. The optimization here details the adaptation of the spectral windows for a particular set of target sources to aerial detection and the tailoring for the specific detectors. As well, the methodology and results for background rejection methods optimized for the aerial gamma-ray detection using Potassium, Uranium and Thorium (KUT) nuisance rejection are shown. Results indicate that use of a realistic KUT nuisance rejection may eliminate metric rises due to background magnitude and spectral steps encountered in aerial detection due to altitude changes and geographically induced steps such as at land–water interfaces.","Aerial detection,Radiation detection,KUT nuisance rejection,Spectral anomaly detection,Aerial search,"
"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"the geochemistry of gem opals as evidence of their origin","2008","Seventy-seven gem opals from ten countries were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) through a dilution process, in order to establish the nature of the impurities. The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (Ba>110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Ba<110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, and to a lesser extent that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to common opals, indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to “chocolate brown”). This element inhibits luminescence for concentrations above 1000 ppm, whereas already a low content in U (≤1 ppm) induces a green luminescence.","Opal,Trace element analysis,Chemical composition,Genesis,ICP-MS,"
"palaeolimnological evidence for widespread late 18th century drought across equatorial east africa","2008","The sediment records of three shallow climate-sensitive lakes in equatorial East Africa (Chibwera and Kanyamukali in western Uganda, and Baringo in central Kenya) contain clear lithological evidence of an episode of complete desiccation in the relatively recent past. Quantitative stratigraphic analyses of bulk sediment composition, texture (% sand and coarse organic detritus), the C/N ratio of bulk organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility allowed us to define a common succession of sedimentary units in all three lakes. This common stratigraphy includes a basal unit of dry and stiff low-organic clays capped by a horizon of peaty mud or peat, overlain by organic lake sediment. We interpret this stratigraphy to represent an episode of (nearly) complete desiccation of these lake basins. This was followed first by an early phase of modest lake refilling, during which time extensive littoral and submerged vegetation developed, producing peaty lake deposits. Mostly higher lake levels later on resulted in deposition of fine-grained lake muds. Using 210Pb and 137Cs activity profiles combined with four AMS 14C dates on single terrestrial plant macrofossils or multiple charred grass particles indicate that in all three lakes the episode of most recent complete desiccation occurred in the late 18th and early 19th century. These results add to an accumulating body of palaeoenvironmental data revealing a prolonged period of extreme drought in equatorial East Africa about 200 years ago, also documented in the cultural history of the African Great Lakes region. Given the geographical spread of the study lakes across the East African plateau, these results indicate that the climatic anomaly of reduced rainfall responsible for this drought was at least sub-continental in scale.","Tropical East Africa,Palaeoclimate,Late Holocene,Sediment stratigraphy,Lake Baringo,Lake-sediment records,"
"multi-scale analysis reveals changing distribution patterns and the influence of social structure on the habitat use of an endangered marine predator, the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus in the western mediterranean sea","2020","The habitat use of marine megafauna emerges from the complex interplay between access to patchy and variable food resources and several intrinsic biological factors, such as the interaction with conspecifics and offspring care, resulting in dynamic distribution patterns. Quantifying species' relationships with the underlying environment is further complicated by the scale-dependent nature of these processes. Multi-scale analyses that incorporate aspects of a species' biology and build on large datasets are therefore required to understand long-term distribution and inform appropriate management measures. In this study, we use monitoring data collected over two study periods (2003–2008 and 2012–2018) to assess the habitat use, trend in local occurrence, and change in distribution of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, around the Balearic Islands (Spain), one of the few recognised breeding and feeding grounds for the ‘Endangered’ population in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we investigate the differences in the habitat use of single animals and groups, to explore intra-specific niche partitioning in this highly social but behaviourally dimorphic species. Results suggest that overall the occurrence of sperm whales in the area has been increasing over time. Animals were found to associate with distinct bathymetric features, but the mechanisms generating these relationships, and the underlying oceanographic processes within this habitat, remained uncertain. Sperm whale distribution also underwent a significant shift between the two study periods, with an increased occurrence in the Mallorca channel and north of Menorca, which further points towards a dynamic use of the broader bathymetric range preferred around the archipelago. Finally, our analyses highlighted that single animals and groups used areas with different characteristics, with groups preferring deeper, warmer waters characterised by lower sea level anomaly, which resulted in some fine-scale spatial segregation. The results of this study shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the biogeography and complex social system of the species, and support the design of targeted conservation measures in this important breeding and feeding ground.","Mediterranean sea,Distribution shift,Balearic archipelago,Sperm whale,Long-term monitoring,Habitat modeling,"
