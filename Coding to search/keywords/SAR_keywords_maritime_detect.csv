"a bistatic synthetic aperture radar imagery simulation of maritime scene using the extended nonlinear chirp scaling algorithm","2013","A bistatic synthetic aperture radar (Bis-SAR) imagery simulation of an extended maritime scene is presented. An efficient facet scattering model is developed to collect the raw coupling scattering data from a ship located on sea surface. Then, to avoid the inefficiency of time-domain algorithms and the azimuth-invariant limit of conventional frequency-domain (FD) methods in the bistatic case, an extended nonlinear chirp scaling (NLCS) algorithm is proposed to handle the bistatic data collected from this facet scattering model. The perfect Bis-SAR simulation results of the ship located on the sea surface could prove the validity of the proposed algorithms as well as the practicability of the model for the Bis-SAR imagery with large squint angle in the FD approach.","bistatic collected data handling,marine radar,sea surface,Marine vehicles,ship,bistatic synthetic aperture radar imagery,Transmitters,Synthetic aperture radar,facet scattering model,squint angle,NLCS algorithm,Scattering,FD approach,ships,extended nonlinear chirp scaling algorithm,maritime scene simulation,Bis-SAR imagery,synthetic aperture radar,Sea surface,radar imaging,frequency-domain analysis,chirp modulation,Azimuth,Algorithm design and analysis,frequency-domain method,electromagnetic wave scattering,natural scenes,"
"assessment of marine litter through remote sensing: recent approaches and future goals","2021","This bibliographic review provides an overview of techniques used to detect marine litter using remote sensing. The review classified studies in terms of platform (satellite, aircrafts, drones), sensors (passive or active), spectral (visible, infrared, microwaves), spatial resolution (<1 to >30 m), type and size (macroplastics, microplastics), or classification methodology (sighting, photointerpretation, supervised). Most studies applied satellite information to address marine litter using multi- and hyper- spectral optical sensors. The correspondence analysis on analyzed variables exhibited that aircrafts with high spatial resolution (<3 m) with optical sensors (λ = 400 to 2500 nm) seem to be the most optimum combination to target marine litter, while satellites carrying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors (λ = 3.1 to 5.6 cm) may detect sea-slicks associated to surfactants that might contain high concentration of microplastics. Gaps indicate that future goals in marine litter detection should be addressed with platforms including optical and SAR sensors.","SAR,Remote sensing,Sea-slicks,Marine plastic litter,Optical sensors,"
"comparison of ship detection algorithms using alos-palsar, ground-based maritime radar, and ais","2011","MLCC (Multi-Look Cross-Correlation) is a useful technique to extract the images of ships embedded in sea clutter from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. However, the previous MLCC has a difficulty of detecting small ships since SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is not high enough. Therefore, we developed a new Improved MLCC (IMLCC) to increase SNR to extract small boats. Although the IMLCC method increased SNR, there still remained some highly correlated noises in the coherence images caused by strong radar backscatter from sea surface. In order to improve the IMLCC algorithm further, we propose a new method of applying Lognormal-CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) to IMLCC coherence images. The results using ALOS-PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-Phased Array L-band SAR) data showed substantial improvement in SNR and detection rate.","ALOS-PALSAR,lognormal-CFAR,marine radar,Coherence,radar detection,CFAR,radar clutter,radar backscatter,ship detection algorithm,Marine vehicles,sea surface,ground-based maritime radar,phased array radar,SAR,Synthetic aperture radar,AIS,IMLCC method,synthetic aperture radar,multilook cross correlation,IMLCC algorithm,radar imaging,Correlation,correlated noise,IMLCC,correlation methods,constant false alarm rate,Azimuth,coherence image,Ship detection,MLCC,Visualization,radar polarimetry,Signal to noise ratio,advanced land observing satellite- phased array L-band SAR,ship SNR,backscatter,"
"gwvt: a gpu maritime vessel tracker based on the wisard weightless neural network","2017","Maritime surveillance systems increase the security of ports and ships. The video tracking is an important and challenging component of a surveillance system. Difficulties can arise due to weather conditions, target trajectory and appearance, occlusions, lighting conditions and noise. The tracker locates the vessel frame by frame in real time. This paper proposes the GPU WiSARD Vessel Tracker GWVT, a maritime vessel tracker that uses the WiSARD weightless neural network and implemented on a GPU. The GPU parallel processing feature allows the tracking algorithm to be executed very fast. CUDA easy the implementation of the parallel WiSARD tracker because the network discriminators fit well in the thread and block layout. The implementation of a WiSARD based vessel tracker on a GPU is innovative on literature. The GWVT realizes the vessel tracking at only 1 millisecond allowing other tracking techniques to be executed in parallel to rise the performance. Discounting the kernel function call time from GWVT average tracking time, GWVT becomes 13,95 faster than the CPU tracker version.","GWVT average tracking time,tracking techniques,vessel frame,GPU parallel processing feature,Neural networks,parallel WiSARD tracker,vessel tracking,GPU,neural nets,target tracking,object tracking,ships,parallel architectures,WiSARD neural network,tracking algorithm,graphics processing units,object detection,target trajectory,video tracking,Radar tracking,GPU WiSARD Vessel Tracker GWVT,network discriminators,CPU tracker version,surveillance system,video signal processing,wisard weightless neural network,Tracking,maritime surveillance systems,Graphics processing units,Training,parallel processing,GPU maritime vessel tracker,ports,Surveillance,video surveillance,Visual Computing,Random access memory,WiSARD based vessel tracker,Detectors,"
"maritime automated targets recognition algorithm test bed for high resolution isar imagery","2013","A maritime automatic target recognition system is under development to perform ship classification using images from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) systems. This work will describe the algorithm framework for feature extraction, classification, and aim-point recognition. ISAR systems produce two-dimensional images of ships from the periodic motion inherent to all maritime objects and can be used to distinguish objects of interest for Homeland Security. There is a need for real-time classification of these objects. This work extends the state of the art in two ways: One - current maritime classification focuses on satellite ISAR, creating latency for classification[1]; and Two - work with Homeland Security ISAR radar systems is focused on concealed weapon detection [2,3]. This work uses localized ISAR images from stationary radars to classify maritime objects. Since the aspect and cross-range scale factor are continually changing, ISAR images form distinct representations unique to each object under observation. These distinct representations are analogous to visual images in many ways. They have unique shapes and areas of strong return, much in the same way objects in passive images have unique sizes and colors. However, ISAR images are synthetic portrayals of scattered field data from active sensor RF sensors whereas visual images are observations of passive sensors. This distinction must be a considered as a design constraint in the classification system - each feature employed must be exhaustively examined regarding its physical counterpart. Within that constraint, ISAR synthetic imagery feature extraction techniques can leverage from previous work developed for passive sensors. This is especially the case of High Range Resolution (HRR) ISAR systems. After extraction from ISAR prototype images, a set of representative features will be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a supervised learning model capable of pattern recognition.","marine radar,active sensor,Inverse synthetic aperture radar,image motion analysis,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,image colour analysis,supervised learning model,Target recognition,periodic motion,ships,radar computing,marine engineering,support vector machines,2D ship images,object detection,automated target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,feature extraction,image classification,maritime automated target recognition algorithm test bed,high range resolution ISAR imagery,RF sensors,Classification algorithms,SVM,homeland security ISAR radar systems,radar imaging,support vector machine classifier,Doppler effect,high resolution,Image segmentation,concealed weapon detection,weapons,satellite ISAR system,aim-point recognition,inverse synthetic aperture radar systems,stationary radars,Image resolution,national security,maritime object classification,image sensors,ship classification,learning (artificial intelligence),pattern recognition,passive sensors,object recognition,oceanographic techniques,"
"prescreening and discrimation of maritime targets in single-channel sar images","2016","A targets detection algorithm is proposed for maritime surveillance by single-channel SAR images.

"bistatic sar maritime ship target 3-d image reconstruction method without distortion in local cartesian coordinate","2023","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) has been attracting worldwide attention because of its forward-looking imaging and high anti-interference. In harsh environment, it is vital for BiSAR to conduct extensive surveillance, imaging, and recognition of maritime ship targets. However, under the disturbance of sea waves, the ship target has an unknown and massive 3-D rotation, so that its imaging projection plane (IPP) is also undetermined. Thus, high-dimensional random distortion appears in imaging results, making it difficult to recognize the target through 2-D distorted images effectively. To solve these problems, BiSAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method without distortion in local Cartesian coordinate (LCC) is proposed. In this article, according to positions of scatterers and rotation parameters, significant differences of different scatterers of maritime ship targets have been found in bistatic range, Doppler centroid (DC), and Doppler frequency rate (DFR), which lays a solid foundation for the scatterer separation of ship targets. On this basis, a 3-D R-DC-DFR domain is constructed, and 2-D echoes of the maritime ship target are projected into R-DC-DFR domain to separate scatterers. Then, by remapping data of transmitter and receiver in R-DC-DFR domain to LCC, as well as evaluating their similarity metric, the optimal rotation parameters of the ship target can be obtained via the maximal similarity. Therefore, the image distortion caused by the unknown IPP has been removed, and 3-D image reconstruction of ship targets can be realized without distortion in the LCC. Furthermore, to evaluate performances of 3-D image reconstruction for different rotation parameters and bistatic configurations, 3-D reconstruction index is proposed and analyzed. Both point-targets and maritime ship targets are simulated to emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed method.","local Cartesian coordinate,bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR),marine radar,R-DC-DFR domain,Image reconstruction,maritime ship target,Marine vehicles,bistatic SAR maritime ship target 3-D image reconstruction method,high-dimensional random distortion,Transmitters,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,3-D reconstruction,ships,synthetic aperture radar,image distortion,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,BiSAR maritime ship target,2-D distorted images,imaging projection plane,Receivers,Imaging,point-targets,remote sensing by radar,local Cartesian coordinate (LCC),oceanographic techniques,"
"a novel technique to identify ais transmissions from vessels which attempt to obscure their position by switching their ais transponder from normal transmit power mode to low transmit power mode","2022","Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are transponder systems installed on marine vessels which transmit the location, speed and other vessel details. These signals are received by shore side AIS Base stations. The use of AIS is mandatory under international SOLAS regulations for certain categories of vessels. AIS is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue (SAR) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their AIS transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their AIS transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with SOLAS regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, AIS transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field (RSSI) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming AIS messages with. The technique presented, analyses received RSSI in combination with predicted RSSI values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National AIS was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in RSSI of approximately 10 dBm (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.","AIS spoofing,Received signal strength indicator,Low transmit power,Sybil attack,Automatic identification system,"

"improving sar wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","2023","Satellite observations are increasingly in demand and valuable for monitoring the ocean and coastal winds in near-real-time and analyzing the data historically. However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","Offshore wind farm,SAR,Sentinel-1,CFAR,Anomalous pixel,Coastal environment,"

"vessel detection and classification from spaceborne optical images: a literature survey","2018","This paper provides an overview of existing literature on vessel/ship detection and classification from optical satellite imagery. Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.","Ship detection,Sea target detection,Ship classification,Maritime domain awareness,Object recognition,Vessel classification,Optical satellite data,Vessel detection,"
"assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern gulf of mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","2018","Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","Landsat,Northern Gulf of Mexico,Offshore platform,Platform status assessment,Remote sensing,SAR,Time-series,"

The objective of the paper is to highlight the limitations and challenges to be considered when processing real, multichannel GMTI data from pioneering SAR sensors for maritime surveillance. Different calibration or channel balancing strategies, on the basis of the digital balancing (DB) method, are studied, considering their impact on SAR-GMTI performance.

"spaceborne multichannel sar imaging algorithm for maritime moving targets","2023","Spaceborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective means to realize high-resolution and wide-swath imaging. However, for spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging of maritime moving targets, the target motion will cause undesired channel imbalance, i.e., phase error, and further introduce the spurious targets in the image. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging algorithm for maritime moving targets, which consists of sequential coarse imaging and accurate imaging. The key strategies are to separate different moving targets by coarse imaging and to estimate the phase error based on the relationship between phase errors and amplitudes of spurious targets. First, the quantitative relationship between phase errors and amplitudes of spurious targets is established. Second, based on coarse imaging results, different maritime targets are effectively separated. Then, based on the measured amplitudes of spurious targets, a cost function, which represents the difference between the real target velocity and estimated target velocity, is constructed and minimized to separately estimate the velocities and phase errors of targets. Moreover, to further improve the accuracy of estimation and to suppress the undesired effects caused by target defocusing, clutter, and noise, an iterative strategy is adopted. Finally, by autofocusing, a well-focused SAR image is obtained. The GF-3 dual-channel real data experiment is conducted. The results indicate that the spurious targets are well suppressed, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","estimation accuracy improvement,well-focused SAR image,undesired channel imbalance,spectrum reconstruction,radar detection,autofocusing,accurate imaging,real target velocity,Synthetic aperture radar,high-resolution imaging,moving target imaging,iterative strategy,spaceborne multichannel synthetic aperture radar,cost function,estimated target velocity,object detection,nonuniform sampling,synthetic aperture radar,spurious targets,radar imaging,velocity measurement,Radar polarimetry,sequential coarse imaging,Channel imbalance estimation,iterative methods,target defocusing,phase error estimation,Azimuth,target motion,GF-3 dual-channel real data experiment,spaceborne multichannel SAR imaging algorithm,spaceborne radar,Imaging,Signal to noise ratio,wide-swath imaging,parameter estimation,Estimation,multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR),Channel estimation,maritime moving targets,"

"integrated x band active phased array radar for maritime surveillance","2021","Airborne maritime surveillance plays an important role in safeguarding the coastline and exclusive economic zones.

This detection problem is handled by a generalized likelihood ratio detector whose test statistics has a simple closed form expression.

"dynamic detection of water surface area of ebinur lake using multi-source satellite data (landsat and sentinel-1a) and its responses to changing environment","2019","In arid and semi-arid climatic areas, lakes are extremely essential for fragile ecological environment and regional sustainable development. Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake becomes a representative ecological degradation region in northwestern China. The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of inter-month dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data.

The maximum lake surface area was 965.29 km2 in April 22nd, 2017, while the minimum value was 750.37 km2 in September 1st, 2017, and the mean area was 831.51 km2. The seasonal variations showed the stages of “sharp rising” – “significant decreasing” – “gradual stabilizing” in the study period. The water surface area was highly correlated with inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P < 0.001). The variation of Ebinur Lake's water surface area is crucial to monitor the resulting eco-environmental impacts under the changing environmental conditions in the arid and semi-arid areas.","Ebinur Lake,Water index,Sentienel-1A,Remote sensing,Eco-environmental impact,"

"automatic detection of rescue targets in maritime search and rescue missions using uavs","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be an important resource when performing Search and Rescue (SAR) operations at sea, as this technology is fairly inexpensive when compared to traditional SAR approaches that use significant human resources and expensive air and naval assets, thus enabling the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously in these missions to perform rescue targets search in maritime environments.In order to maximize the usefulness of these UAVs in such operations, we propose a method which utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection network to perform real-time rescue target detection on-board the UAV, using standard RGB cameras, with minimal human intervention, thus enabling an increased vehicle autonomy and search range. Additionally, since the UAVs only relay the candidate images and locations that contain possible rescue targets, given by the onboard detector, it is possible to have several UAVs working in parallel that report back to a single human operator.We have selected the YOLOv4-tiny detection network, pretrained in the COCO dataset, and retrained it to detect rescue targets at sea. For this purpose some datasets were recorded and annotated to simulate the presence of maritime rescue targets. The proposed approach has been validated on an independent test dataset, showing that it has good detection capabilities and thus providing convincing results regarding the use of UAVs with automatic target detection capabilities in SAR missions.","automatic target detection capabilities,rescue missions,remotely operated vehicles,real-time rescue target detection on-board,maritime rescue targets,Cameras,Search problems,significant human resources,Relays,rescue targets search,cameras,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,maritime search,YOLOv4-tiny detection network,Autonomous aerial vehicles,single human operator,increased vehicle autonomy,Real-time systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,state-of-the-art object detection network,mobile robots,search range,image sensors,Object detection,possible rescue targets,Detectors,UAV,automatic detection,"
"first comparison of sentinel-1 and terrasar-x data in the framework of maritime targets detection: south italy case","2016","The Sentinel-1A is the first of two satellites that composes the Sentinel-1 radar mission. Both satellites operate a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system to give continuity to the European SAR program. SAR is a flexible sensor able to fulfil users/applications requirements in terms of resolution and coverage thanks to different operational modes and polarizations. With the in-orbit availability of very-high-resolution X-band SAR sensors, the Sentinel-1 satellites have been designed to achieve wide coverage at medium to high resolution. The interferometric wide swath (IWS) mode implemented with the terrain observation with progressive scan (TOPS) technique is the standard acquisition mode over European waters and land masses. IWS in dual-polarization (VV/VH) combination offers 250-km swath at 5 m Ã— 20 m (range Ã— azimuth) spatial resolution. These specifications are in line with the needs of the European Maritime and Security Agency (EMSA) for oil spill and ship detection applications included in the CleanSeaNet program. The main goals of this paper are: assessment of medium-to-high-resolution C-band Sentinel-1 data with very-high-resolution X-band TerraSAR-X data for maritime targets detection; synergetic use of multiplatforms satellite SAR data for target features extraction; evaluation of polarimetric target detectors for the available co-polarization and cross-polarization Sentinel-1A IWS VV/VH products. The objectives are achieved by means of real, almost coincident C-band and X-band SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X satellites over Gulf of Naples and Catania (South Italy).

"nonambiguous sar image formation of maritime targets using weighted sparse approach","2018","For a single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR), finite-pulse repetition frequency and nonideal antenna pattern cause azimuth ambiguities, i.e., ghosts in image domain. In this paper, a novel algorithm of locating processing weighted group lasso SAR image formation for maritime targets is proposed to effectively mitigate the ambiguities, which can work on a single-look complex SAR image. In the scheme, the ambiguous signal model using the conventional SAR focusing processor is first explicitly derived, showing the analytical expression of SAR image formulation. The weighted sparse group lasso algorithm is then employed to group-sparsely reconstruct the subimages of nonambiguous and ambiguous Doppler components. In particular, we introduce adaptively weighted sparsity constraint, obtained from a priori azimuth antenna pattern, and clutter clustering during sparse imaging. It should be emphasized that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the azimuth resolution by coherently integrating the ambiguous signal components, which greatly helps the target detection and recognition in maritime surveillance. Finally, experiments based on simulated and measured data are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","sparse imaging,marine radar,image resolution,target detection,ambiguous signal model,sparse group lasso algorithm,Signal resolution,single-channel synthetic aperture radar,finite-pulse repetition frequency,radar antennas,clutter clustering,Doppler components,Synthetic aperture radar,maritime surveillance,Azimuth ambiguities,Focusing,object detection,radar target recognition,synthetic aperture radar,maritime targets,antenna pattern,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,antenna radiation patterns,SAR focusing processor,weighted sparse group lasso algorithm,Azimuth,weighted sparsity constraint,Image resolution,radar resolution,SAR image formulation,azimuth resolution,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),"

"convolutional neural network-based novel framework for ship recognition in poor visibility maritime surveillance videos","2023","Ship recognition is a central component of the information perception for smart ships. Traditionally, the ship recognition mission is completed by remote sensing or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or manual calibration via maritime surveillance video. However, the difficulty arises in implementing the mission when it suffers the weather with a poor visibility. The recognition accuracy may deteriorate dramatically in such a hostile environment, especially in the heavy fog environment at sea when using conventional methods. In this case, we develop a novel framework for ship recognition based on a smart recognition system that relies on the dark channel defogging and the neural networks. First, a dark-channel defogging algorithm is utilized to remove the adverse impact of poor visibility on recognition. After that, three different neural networks are used to train the defogged images (Specifically: Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3). Finally, we present qualitative and quantitative analyses of three different neural network models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a hostile environment, especially in fog weather with poor visibility at sea.","Image recognition,Neural networks,Ship recognition,Sea surface,Visualization,Surveillance,Robust framework,Marine vehicles,Statistical analysis,Convolutional Neural Networks,Defog method,"
"coprime synthetic aperture radar (copsar): a new acquisition mode for maritime surveillance","2015","In this paper, we propose a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique able, in the case of bright targets over a dark background, to reduce the amount of data to be stored and processed, and, at the same time, to increase the range swath, with no geometric resolution loss. Accordingly, the proposed approach can be usefully employed in ocean monitoring for ship detection. The technique consists of a new SAR acquisition mode and of very simple processing. It is based on the adaptation of the coprime array beamforming concept to the case of SAR systems: two interlaced sequences of pulses are transmitted, with two sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) that are equal to the Nyquist PRF divided by two coprime integer numbers. Each sequence is separately processed via standard SAR processing, and the two final aliased images are combined in a very simple way to cancel aliasing. We call the proposed approach â€œcoprime SARâ€ (CopSAR). Three different implementations are proposed, and the effectiveness of the CopSAR concept is demonstrated by using both simulated and real SAR data. It turns out that the significant data amount reduction and the range swath increase are only paid with a reduction of the target-to-background ratio and with the presence of a (nonstringent) limit on ship azimuth size.","range swath,standard SAR processing,Antennas,coprime array beamforming concept,ship detection,CopSAR target-to-background ratio,SAR systems,Marine vehicles,coprime synthetic aperture radar,sub-Nyquist pulse repetition frequencies,Synthetic aperture radar,ocean monitoring,SAR technique,Standards,maritime surveillance,synthetic aperture radar,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),geometric resolution loss,CopSAR concept,maritime applications,SAR acquisition mode,Azimuth,Sensors,ship azimuth size,Coprime sampling,remote sensing by radar,Arrays,oceanographic techniques,"

Apart from achieving well-focused images, also the knowledge of ship velocity is strategic information for surveillance.

"sarfish: space-based maritime surveillance using complex synthetic aperture radar imagery","2022","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an essential part of maritime surveillance since it can operate in most weather conditions, day and night. Space-borne SAR especially can provide a large surveillance coverage in which both ground-range detected (GRD) imagery at a reduced resolution and single-look complex (SLC) imagery at a finer resolution of the same observation scene are available. Recently, a large, fully labeled, Sentinel-1 GRD based dataset, named xView3-SAR, was released to promote machine learning (ML) research in detection and classification of ships in order to assist with monitoring illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. In this paper, the xView3-SAR's companion SLC dataset, called the SARFish, is introduced. The aim is to promote the use of SLC data for improving IUU fishing ship detection and classification. An ML-based algorithm using the combined GRD-SLC SAR data is presented as a base-line model for demonstration. The algorithm consists of a constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector whose false-alarm rate is reduced by a cascade of classifiers trained using the GRD data, followed by a ship classifier trained using the SLC data. Preliminary results suggest that despite not using multi-looks to reduce sea-clutter spikes, the use of SLC images does not degrade ship detection. Furthermore, a very modest improvement in ship classification is observed.11Under contract from Rheinmetall Defence Australia Pty Ltd, Adelaide, SA, Australia.","radio frequencies,classification,space-based maritime Surveillance,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,maritime vessels,maritime objects,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,Meteorology,complex Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery,MS,visible frequencies,electro-optic imaging,single-look complex (SLC),synthetic aperture radar,Classification algorithms,radar imaging,Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR),Radar polarimetry,SARFish,sufficient spatial resolution,Australia,radar imaging category,Image resolution,ground-range detected (GRD),constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detection,space-borne SAR imagery,Surveillance,imaging modalities,Spaceborne radar,remote sensing by radar,image coverage,machine learning (ML),image scene,"

"maritime surveillance with undersampled sar","2017","According to the minimum antenna area constraint, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems require a low-pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to image the wide swaths in ocean surface monitoring scenarios. However, the low PRF that is lower than the Doppler bandwidth will cause azimuth ambiguities. This letter proposes a novel method of mitigating azimuth ambiguities when using an undersampled SAR system for ship detection over the open sea. In this letter, the concept of range subspectra is adopted to misregister the azimuth ambiguity signals. In addition, a change detection method that uses a principal component analysis and k-means clustering is adopted to detect differences in the azimuth ambiguities between two range subspectra images in which the azimuth ambiguities are misregistered. By compensating for the ambiguities in the corresponding image, the ambiguities can be mitigated. This method is only appropriate for bright targets over dark backgrounds in which residual energy loss occurs for useful signals. Both simulated and real data processing results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it is feasible for maritime surveillance.","two range subspectra images,ship detection,low-pulse repetition frequency,change detection method,azimuth ambiguity mitigation method,bright targets,Principal component analysis,range subspectrum,Synthetic aperture radar,undersampled,undersampled SAR system,image ambiguities,maritime surveillance,Azimuth ambiguities,real data processing,synthetic aperture radar,ocean surface monitoring scenarios,azimuth ambiguity signals,range subspectra concept,Doppler effect,dark backgrounds,Bandwidth,Azimuth,Doppler bandwidth,residual energy loss,open sea,Imaging,synthetic aperture radar systems,principal component analysis,Barium,minimum antenna area,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),k-mean clustering,oceanographic techniques,"

"unambiguous imaging for moving targets in maritime scenarios with dual receive channel mode of gf-3 satellite","2019","Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor that can operate in the dual receive channel (DRC) mode. Different from the traditional single-channel SAR system, the multichannel SAR system can overcome the inherent limitation to achieve high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) at the same time. However, the key challenge it faces is false target suppression. Especially for the moving vessels on the ocean, the existence of false targets will increase false alarm probability and affect the interpretation of SAR images. In this paper, the method of integration of detection, velocity estimation, location, and imaging for moving targets in the HRWS SAR system is proposed as well as applied to get an unambiguous image.

"comparison of detectability of ship wake components between c-band and x-band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","2023","The detectability of wake components is affected by influencing parameters, which can be categorized into ship properties, environmental conditions and image acquisition settings. The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","Ship wake detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Maritime object detection,Detectability modelling,Machine learning,"

"requirement on antenna cross-polarization isolation for the operational use of c-band sar constellations in maritime surveillance","2010","The issue of antenna cross-polarization isolation has been previously discussed for the design of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs). Dual-polarized antennas with cross-polarization isolation that is better than -30 dB are desirable for more convenient polarimetric data calibration since measurements of antenna crosstalk (magnitude and phase) variations with incidence angle are not required. For an antenna with significant polarization crosstalk, it is still possible to retrieve pure polarization measurements of HH, HV, VH, and VV provided that the four corresponding received voltages are measured. However, it is not possible to recover from cross-polarization contamination for single- or dual-polarization measurements. Therefore, it is important to set up a minimum requirement on dual-polarized antenna isolation so that single- and dual-polarization applications are not unduly affected. In this letter, the minimum requirement on cross-polarization antenna isolation is investigated for operational use of C-band SARs in maritime surveillance applications. Calibrated polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data are used to simulate single- and dual-polarization data with cross-polarization contamination for a dual-polarized antenna with cross-polarization isolation ranging from -20 to -35 dB. It is shown that the cross-polarization HV (or VH) channel can be significantly affected, particularly at steep incidence angles. As a result, key applications that require the use of pure HV, such as ship detection and wind-speed measurements, are significantly affected. A requirement for a minimum of -30-dB antenna isolation is established. Antennas with cross-polarization isolation better than -35 dB are desirable for reliable exploitation of HV data at steep incidence angles.","multipolarization,antenna crosstalk,ship detection,Antenna measurements,Aperture antennas,antenna cross-polarization isolation,Pollution measurement,wind-speed measurement,synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry,C-band SAR constellations,Antenna,Contamination,maritime surveillance,dual-polarized antennas,synthetic aperture radar,polarization crosstalk,search radar,Phase measurement,polarimetric synthetic aperture radars,Crosstalk,Polarization,Calibration,dual polarization,calibration,radar polarimetry,Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar,Surveillance,crosstalk,RADARSAT-2,"

"concurrent use of satellite imaging and passive acoustics for maritime domain awareness","2010","The research being conducted in the Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR), a DHS National Center of Excellence for Port Security examines some basic science issues and emerging technologies to improve the security of ports and inland waterways, as well as coastal and offshore operations. This research follows a layered approach utilizing above water and underwater surveillance techniques. The investigated layers include satellite-based wide area surveillance; HF Radar systems providing over-the-horizon monitoring; and nearshore and harbor passive acoustic surveillance. Integration of these systems is aimed at achieving vessel detection, classification, identification, and tracking. In this paper, we present the results of sea tests where satellite imagery was combined with concurrent passive acoustic surveillance. The wide area sensing was provided by the University of Miami CSTARS facility's electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. Satellites detected the ships using a panchromatic EO sensor FormoSat-2 and SAR from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. The Stevens Passive Acoustic System was used for detecting sound produced by the same ships that were detected by satellites. Concurrent Satellite - Acoustic measurements provide the following advantages: 1. Increasing the probability of small vessel detection and decreasing false alarms. 2. The joint systems can provide redundant detection and classification in conditions where one of the systems fails. For example, EO satellite imaging does not work at night and in fog and cloudy conditions while acoustic detection has limits during stormy weather due to ambient noise. SAR imaging can detect vessels in all weather, but provides less detail about a specific vessel. 3. Acoustics can provide target classification and bearing and satellites can give target localization and heading. SAR data can be used to estimate vessel speed in some cases. 4. Satellite imaging is helpful for the acoustic detection of an underwater target in cases when satellite information allows separation of surface and underwater targets. 5. Joint measurements provide more data (information) for target classification. Several tests were conducted in New York Harbor, where the satellite images and acoustic signatures of the same boats were recorded. The satellite registered a number of small boats.

"high-squint sar imaging of maritime ship targets","2022","High-squint synthetic aperture radar (HS-SAR) imaging technology greatly enhances the flexibility of SAR. However, the existing HS-SAR imaging algorithms are generally based on the assumption that the illuminated target is static during the synthetic aperture formation. As a consequence, the state-of-the-art algorithms are unable to focus on moving targets well, thus leading to displaced and blurred images of the targets. A maritime ship is a typical kind of moving target with complex noncooperative motion, which has received much attention. Thus, it is a difficult but valuable issue to study HS-SAR imaging of ship targets. In this work, the influence of ship translation and fluctuation is theoretically analyzed. On the basis of these analyses, the new conception of â€œthird range compression (TRC)â€ caused by ship translation is proposed, and the squint minimization (SM) operation is implemented for the compensation of TRC. Moreover, considering that the target Doppler parameters induced by ship fluctuation are related to its position, a novel method called WASH-CLEAN (watershed and CLEAN) is proposed to automatically focus ship scattering points with different swings. Finally, we propose an integrated modified range-Doppler (RD) imaging algorithm by combining the advantages of HS-SAR and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR).

"change detection support for supervisory controllers of highly automated systems: effects on performance, mental workload, and recovery of situation awareness following interruptions","2018","Dynamic Positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled process to automatically keep a floating vessel at a specific position or to follow a pre-defined path (tracking) by using its own propellers and thrusters. The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.","Management-by-exception,Situation Awareness Recovery (SAR),Dynamic positioning,Human-automation collaboration,Out-of-the-loop (OOTL) performance problem,"

Results from a three year period of the study show that as a main environmental problem, oil pollution has a relatively high percentage of spatial distribution in the bay.

"wavelet-based despeckling for onboard image processing in a small satellite sar maritime surveillance constellation","2012","New developments in small spacecraft capabilities will soon enable formation-flying constellations of small satellites, capable of performing remote sensing missions at low cost. One such mission concept under investigation involves a maritime surveillance microsatellite constellation. Two or more small microsatellites will follow a large synthetic aperture radar (SAR) transmitter, each carrying a SAR receiver antenna and one carrying an automatic identification system (AIS) antenna. Voluntary broadcasts of vessel position and velocity via AIS are received and decoded, and compared with SAR observations to verify the data and identify potentially non-cooperative vessels. Limited transmit power and downlink time will dictate that data be processed onboard the spacecraft.

"spaceborne radar imaging of maritime moving targets with the cosmo-skymed sar system","2014","Advanced satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, such as Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK), provide high-resolution images with reasonably short revisiting time, allowing for a number of applications in areas such as homeland security and maritime surveillance. Especially in the case of maritime surveillance, moving targets imaging represents a challenge for SAR systems as the complex target motions produce evident image defocusing. In this paper, we propose a complete processing chain that aims at detecting and imaging ship targets moving inside the imaged scene. In the proposed technique, moving targets are focused by using inverse SAR (ISAR) processing, which proves effective also in the case of target's complex motions. The implemented processing chain can be considered an innovative combination of well-established detection and ISAR imaging approaches. It is important to state that the proposed maritime ISAR mode for the CSK SAR system acts as an add-on system and, therefore, does not require any modification to the original CSK design. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by processing archive images acquired by CSK in spotlight mode; moreover results obtained by using CSK images acquired ad hoc against a cooperative target are also provided in order to prove the validity of the overall chain also in presence of targets with small size. As additional option of the proposed maritime ISAR it will also be shown that super-resolution techniques are applicable to targets affected by complex motions after ISAR processing is used.","spaceborne radar imaging,Marine vehicles,Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR),Cosmo-SkyMed SAR System,Synthetic aperture radar,geophysical image processing,add-on system,Program processors,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),superresolution techniques,radar imaging,Image segmentation,Radar imaging,spaceborne radar,Imaging,Spaceborne radar,inverse SAR processing,remote sensing by radar,maritime moving targets,"
"high resolution isar imaging for maritime targets by encoder-decoder network combined with the time-frequency attention","2021","The Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging result of a rotating maritime target is usually defoculsing since the complex sea conditions may cause time-varying spin speed of targets. A common solution is to utilize range instantaneous Doppler (RID) algorithm for short time imaging, however, the RID algorithm suffers from the low time-frequency resolution. Therefore, this paper proposes an Encoder-Decoder neural net-work combined with Time-Frequency Attention (TFA) module to enhance instantaneous frequency resolution. The TFA module is utilized to extract the spectral lines of weak scatterers, further, the Encoder-Decoder network is designed to transform the low-resolution time-frequency refined by the TFA module to their high-resolution counterparts.

Operational activities show regular occurrence of accidental and deliberate oil spill in European waters.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire under cloud cover and during polar nights. Additionally, polarimetry has been proven to improve the detection capability. In this work, we compare six state-of-the-art quad polarimetric detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small sized icebergs in four locations in Greenland. These were the polarimetric notch filter (PNF), polarimetric match filter (PMF), polarimetric whitening filter (PWF), optimal polarimetric detector (OPD), reflection symmetry detector, and the dual polarisation anomaly detector (iDPolRAD). We use four single look complex ALOS-2 quad pol images. The data were calibrated and processed.

"tracing illegal oil discharges from vessels using sar and ais in bohai sea of china","2021","In China's 14th Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to coordinate the promotion of marine ecological protection and prevent environmental risks such as marine oil spills. The illegal discharge of oily waste from ships is an important source of oil spill pollution in the Bohai Sea, and has become an important factor hindering the purification of the marine environment. Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea. AIS can provide real-time and historical position and track information of ships. The combination of SAR and AIS can provide a great help for maritime regulatory authorities to find the source of oil spill pollution. However, China has not yet established a mature and effective oil spill supervision system based on SAR and AIS. This paper proposes a framework for oil spill detection and accountability using the combination of SAR, AIS and boarding inspection, and takes an example of the monitoring and tracking process of illegal oil discharge from a ship in the Bohai Sea. As far as we know, this is the first time that China has used SAR and AIS to identify ships that illegally discharge oily sewage. This work framework can provide a reference for China's maritime agencies to improve the oil spill supervision system during the 14th Five-Year Plan.","Synthetic aperture radar,Illegal discharge,Automatic identification system,Oil spill,"
"satellite surveillance of fishing vessel activity in the ascension island exclusive economic zone and marine protected area","2019","Designation of large expanses of the ocean as Marine Protected Area (MPA) is increasingly advocated and realised. The effectiveness of such MPAs, however, requires improvements to vessel monitoring and enforcement capability. In 2014 commercial fishing was excluded from the Ascension Island Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In 2015, through updated regulations, a licenced fishery re-opened in the northern half of the EEZ while the southern half remained closed. To assess compliance with these closures and regulations, several promising satellite technologies (Satellite Automatic Identification System (S-AIS), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) of two vessels), were trialled alongside at-sea patrols. Use of SAR enabled assessment of ‘dark’ (non-AIS transmitting) vessels, the scope of whose activities are hardest to gauge. The high level of compliance with regulations observed, suggests the MPA may prove effective, yet a need for vigilance remains. Vessels aggregate near the EEZ border and a quarter of vessels tracked across three years exhibited S-AIS transmission gaps and present a heightened compliance risk. Use of remote, rather than local, expertise and infrastructure provide a blue-print and economies of scale for replicating monitoring across similarly sized MPAs; particularly for large (>~ 25 m) vessels with metallic superstructures conducive to SAR detection. Funding ongoing monitoring in Ascension is challenged by current levels of license uptake, which provides insufficient offsetting revenue. Satellite-derived intelligence, can be used to set risk thresholds and trigger detailed investigations. Planning long-term monitoring must, however, incorporate adequate resources for follow-up, through patrols and correspondence with flag-states and fisheries management organisations.","Satellite surveillance,Marine Protected Area,Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction,Compliance,High seas,Fisheries,"

The SAR images which form the test data are complemented with ground truth to define the reference detection configuration, which permits quantifying the probability of detection, the false alarm rate, and the accuracy of estimating ship dimensions. Although the results show that all the detectors perform well, there is no perfect detector, and a better detection system could be developed that combines the best elements from each of the single detectors.

To solve the problem that classical cellular iterative search (CIS) algorithm is easy to fall into local optimal solution when determining the mission area, the particle swarm optimization algorithm based on time-space weight (TS-PSO) is proposed in this paper. This algorithm summarizes the optimization objectives and constraint conditions of the MSAR mission area planning according to search theory, carries out the parametric modeling of mission area legitimately and obtains the global optimal solution by continuous exploration in the parameter definition domain. On this basis, by analyzing the time-space weight of drift prediction data, the optimization results are further improved.

"an unambiguous imaging method of moving target for maritime scenes with spaceborne high-resolution and wide-swath sar","2022","In azimuth multichannel high-resolution and wide-swath (AMC-HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, undersampling of azimuth signal results in the failure of the single-channel echo imaging, so the echoes of all the channels should be reconstructed to obtain the unambiguous SAR image. Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the stationary scene echoes. However, moving targets (MTs) will cause false targets in the reconstructed SAR image, which has a great influence on SAR image interpretation and moving target detection, especially in maritime scenes. Hence, we propose an unambiguous imaging method of the moving target for maritime scenes with AMC-HRWS SAR. First, azimuth deramp processing is introduced to obtain coarse-focused moving targets, and then their echoes can be extracted from the sea clutter. Based on the extracted data, a radial velocity estimation method is proposed, which is high efficiency and does not require redundant channels. In addition, based on the estimated radial velocity and the characteristics of the coarse-focused signal, a novel signal reconstruction method of moving target is presented. The reconstruction performance of this method is not affected by channel imbalance, and false targets can be removed even if there is radial velocity error. Besides, the effectiveness of this scheme is verified by the simulation data and GaoFen-3 SAR real data. The estimated radial velocities of ships are verified by automatic identification system (AIS) information. The imaging results show that false targets are effectively suppressed, and moving targets are located in correct positions.","moving target detection,GaoFen-3 SAR real data,stationary scene echoes,SAR image interpretation,Image reconstruction,image resolution,azimuth multichannel high-resolution,image sampling,wide-swath SAR,single-channel echo imaging,Synthetic aperture radar,Signal reconstruction,high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS),AMC-HRWS SAR,false targets,object detection,synthetic aperture radar,radial velocity estimation method,signal reconstruction,unambiguous imaging method,image reconstruction,radar imaging,Doppler effect,moving target (MT) signal reconstruction,novel signal reconstruction method,radial velocity estimation,maritime scenes,Azimuth,spaceborne high-resolution,unambiguous SAR image,Imaging,maritime scene,Estimation,synthetic aperture radar (SAR),reconstructed SAR image,Azimuth multichannel (AMC),"

"global decrease in heavy metal concentrations in brown algae in the last 90 years","2023","In the current scenario of global change, heavy metal pollution is of major concern because of its associated toxic effects and the persistence of these pollutants in the environment. This study is the first to evaluate the changes in heavy metal concentrations worldwide in brown algae over the last 90 years (>15,700 data across the globe reported from 1933 to 2020). The study findings revealed significant decreases in the concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb and Zn of around 60–84% (ca. 2% annual) in brown algae tissues. The decreases were consistent across the different families considered (Dictyotaceae, Fucaceae, Laminariaceae, Sargassaceae and Others), and began between 1970 and 1990. In addition, strong relationships between these trends and pH, SST and heat content were detected. Although the observed metal declines could be partially explained by these strong correlations, or by adaptions in the algae, other evidences suggest an actual reduction in metal concentrations in oceans because of the implementation of environmental policies. In any case, this study shows a reduction in metal concentrations in brown algae over the last 50 years, which is important in itself, as brown algae form the basis of many marine food webs and are therefore potential distributors of pollutants.","Temporal trends,Hazardous elements,Marine pollution,Biomonitoring,Climate change,"
"a fast sar image position algorithm for maritime target location","2016","In order to find the maritime targets location in SAR image accurately, a fast R-D algorithm is introduced in this paper and it can solve targets location problems which are in the sea area. The real latitude and longitude coordinates measure system and geographical coordinates are built up for SAR image, then the targets located in the sea can be point out. First, based on information in SAR satellite data headers the Doppler center frequency coefficients can be calculated. Then the parameters are carried in the R-D pattern for calculate four vertex coordinates of SAR image. Generally the solution of R-D pattern is an iterative process, here a fast algorithm is proposed which combined with slope distance, Doppler parameters and earth model to reduce variables, then and the position of SAR is calculated and the latitude and longitude coordinates of target is also obtained. Second, the SAR image geocoding can be made up and the target in SAR image over sea can be found out. Finally, compare these results with AIS data, the accuracy of location is analyzed.

"an automated sar-based method for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2023","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active Earth observation system that can obtain high-resolution ocean images all day and all weather. It can be used for monitoring the marine environment, maritime traffic, and oil spills at sea. SAR provides accurate and real-time ocean information, which can ensure water traffic safety and ecological environment. Therefore, it plays an irreplaceable role in maritime surveillance. At present, deep-learning based object detection methods have achieved certain results in the application of ship detection in SAR images. Ship targets in SAR images have strong angular reflection characteristics, causing some parts of them to have large grayscale values, appearing as scattering points. At the same time, the heading of ship usually has a certain angle with the horizontal direction. Traditional deep-learning models do not have sufficient generalization ability for these situations. Horizontal bounding boxes also contain a large amount of background features, which affects the accuracy of the model. In response to these characteristics, first use convolutional neural network to extract ship features; Secondly, generate oriented proposals to reduce the impact of background features; Thirdly, using Canny and Harris to obtain features of ship edges and scattering points as attention mechanisms to enhance bounding box regression and classification; Finally, optimize the loss function, which will consider the influence of angle.

"ocean oil spill detection from sar images based on multi-channel deep learning semantic segmentation","2023","One of the major threats to marine ecosystems is pollution, particularly, that associated with the offshore oil and gas industry. Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea. These images were pre-processed to create a 3-channel input image IM = ","Oil spill detection,Deep learning,SAR images,Spatial filtering,"

"iso-kinematic maps from statistical analysis of ps-insar data of piemonte, nw italy: comparison with geological kinematic trends","2011","SAR interferometry based on Permanent Scatterers (PS-InSAR™) is used here to study the present crustal mobility of a large area of NW Italy, in the Piemonte region. Thirty-eight satellite scenes (ERS SAR), taken from May 1992 to January 2001, were analysed for detecting more than 2million PS on the study area. Continuous velocity surface maps (Iso-Kinematic Maps: IKM) were obtained from geo-statistical and spatial cluster techniques (Hot Spot analysis) of PS “short-period” data, to identify relative ground motions and to compare them with “long-period” tectonic mobility trends, i.e. those inferred at regional scale over geological times (some million years). The comparison was made by individuation of homogeneous kinematic areas, represented in the IKM, and characterization of the boundaries between them (Iso-Kinematic Boundaries: IKB). The IKB were used as tools to asses if the PS-InSAR data on present-day crustal mobility could fit with the distribution of real tectonic structures or field geological elements. IKM were drawn for uplifting geological sectors of Piemonte (Maritime Alps, Gran Paradiso, Langhe) where moderate to very low seismicity is recorded, and gravitational instabilities of rock mass on mountain slopes are widespread. The land sectors have been chosen in order to test the suitability of IKM in very different geo-morphological conditions. Different types of correspondence between the IKM and the geological kinematic trend were found:-a first type in which the kinematic trend of short-period (a decade of years, i.e. the PS-InSAR detection time span) is in agreement with a long-period tectonic trend (some million years) and seem to be driven by well known faults subparallel to the IKB. These kinematic trends can be hidden by the slope movement due to gravitational instabilities;-a second type in which the kinematic trend of short-period does not strictly correspond to the long-period trend, but can be considered as minor-order, uplifting-subsidence cycles, even if in contrast with the long-period kinematic trend. Alternatively, the short-period kinematic trends could reflect the action of deep-seated geological forces or structures, not yet known or inferable (at least with the recorded PS-InSAR velocities) on the basis of the available geological data and models.",""
"influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern chile","2016","We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","Length,Reproduction,Anchovy,Environment,Northern Chile,Humboldt Current System,"

"an intelligent decision algorithm for the generation of maritime search and rescue emergency response plans","2019","Maritime search and rescue (SAR) decisions are the most important part of maritime SAR operations. In the process of making maritime SAR decisions, a key factor affecting efficiency and success rate is how to quickly respond to accidents and develop an emergency response plan. At present, maritime SAR emergency response plans are still mostly obtained through a combination of drift prediction models and SAR experience. There is a lack of SAR resource scheduling and SAR task assignment. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using an intelligent decision-making algorithm to formulate maritime SAR emergency response plans so as to produce results more scientifically. First, the relevant research areas and research data are briefly introduced, and the main mathematical models involved in the optimal search theory are expounded. Next, key technologies involved in the process of maritime SAR emergency response plan generation, including the determination of search area, the scheduling of SAR resources, the allocation of search tasks, and the planning of search routes, are analyzed in detail. Two optimization model algorithms, namely the SAR resource scheduling model based on genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA) and the regional task allocation algorithm based on space-time characteristics, are proposed as approaches to solving the problem of resource scheduling and task allocation. Finally, the effectiveness and optimization of the proposed algorithms are verified by analyzing the emergency response of a real case which occurred in the Bohai Sea and comparing the different schemes.

"supporting maritime search and rescue missions through uas-based wireless localization","2018","The use of unmanned aircraft systems to support maritime search and rescue missions holds great potential. Applications range from the fast and efficient search of vessels and persons in distress to the provision of rescue and communication resources. In this paper, we address a received signal strength based localization method of persons without dedicated search and rescue equipment. The specific challenge addressed in this work is to analyze the proposed localization method under realistic conditions. Thus, a maritime channel model is implemented and by means of field tests experimentally validated. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated in a two step concept: In the first step the capability of different search patterns and localization algorithms is analyzed and evaluated in a hardware in the loop simulation environment. In the second step, a scaled experimental setup, which uses a technology comparable to cellular communications, is evaluated to prove the viability of the overall system. Besides the overall accuracy, the required localization time is a key performance indicator.

"surveillance in maritime scenario using deep learning and swarm intelligence","2022","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have played a crucial role in supporting Search and Rescue (SAR) Operations due to their fast movement capabilities and flexibility. During a search and rescue operation scenario, the time constraint is a crucial parameter, so the required time to detect humans in distress with precision is also a vital part. Modern Deep learning algorithms like CNN also aid in these missions. However, most models and datasets available focus on search and rescue missions on the ground or land. UAV-based search and rescue operations in the Maritime Scenario remain a challenge. This study focused on using deep learning algorithms such as CNN to precisely detect a human in peril with a swarm of drones. At the same time, we emphasize using swarm intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO) to effectively find a victim in the shortest time by exploring a massive area. The distinctiveness of this system is that it combines the model with the best accuracy to detect and the best swarm intelligence algorithm for finding targets in the quickest time possible, thus enhancing the surveillance mission.

Along with that, among three different swarm intelligence algorithms, according to the simulation, Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm took the minimum average time, which is 20.4 units, whereas the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm and Bat Optimization Algorithm, respectively, took 65.6 and 73.8 units of time.","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),emergency management,CNN part,Particle Swarm Algorithm,rescue missions,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Maritime Scenario,Particle Swarm Optimization,remotely operated vehicles,Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm,rescue operation scenario,Bat Optimization Algorithm,Marine Search and Rescue (SAR),flexibility,fast movement capabilities,particle swarm optimisation,quickest time,VGG16,different swarm intelligence algorithms,surveillance mission,Helicopters,swarm intelligence algorithm,rescue operations,object detection,optimisation,MobileNetV2 models,image classification,Particle swarm optimization,minimum average time,convolutional neural nets,autonomous aerial vehicles,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),Object Detection,Boats,datasets available focus,Deep learning,Computational modeling,Surveillance,time constraint,Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm,Swarm Intelligence,Time factors,swarm intelligence,Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,Modern Deep learning algorithms,"
"onboard processing concept for maritime surveillance demonstrated with dlrâ€™s airborne radar sensors f-sar and dbfsar","2021","In the paper an onboard processing concept for maritime surveillance applications is proposed. It is suited for airborne platforms and future high-altitude platforms (HAP). The concept uses range-compressed single- and multichannel radar data as input and doesnâ€™t require time consuming synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing as conventionally needed when it comes to ship detection with spaceborne SAR systems. Small coherent processing intervals (CPIs) are used for detecting and tracking the ships in range-Doppler domain. In addition to the reduced processing requirements, the range-Doppler domain has the advantage that even ships with small radar cross section (RCS) can be detected when they move with a certain line-of-sight velocity so that their signals are shifted in Doppler to the exo-clutter region. In the paper the overall processing concept is briefly discussed and the effectiveness is demonstrated by using real radar data acquired with DLRâ€™s airborne radar sensors F-SAR [1] and DBFSAR [2].",""

"seaweed and climate change: a mapping review","2023","Seaweed has garnered increasing interest due to its capacity to mitigate climate change by curbing carbon emissions from agriculture, as well as its potential to serve as a supplement or alternative for dietary, livestock feed, or fuel source production. Moreover, seaweed is regarded as one of the earliest plant forms to have evolved on Earth. Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including “marine heatwave”, “temperate estuary”, “ocean acidification”, and “macroalgal bloom”. The most frequently cited keywords are “climate change”, “biomass”, “community”, and “photosynthesis”. The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions. We propose that seaweed production may be compromised during prolonged episodes of reduced water availability, emphasizing the need to formulate strategies to guarantee its continued viability. This article offers fresh perspectives on the analysis of seaweed research in the context of impending climate change.","Photosynthesis,Phytoplankton,Eutrophication,"
"the costa concordia last cruise: the first application of high frequency monitoring based on cosmo-skymed constellation for wreck removal","2016","The Italian vessel Costa Concordia wrecked on January 13th 2012 offshore the Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), with the loss of 32 lives. Salvage operation of the vessel started immediately after the wreck. This operation was the largest and most expensive maritime salvage ever attempted on a wrecked ship and it ended in July 2014 when the Costa Concordia was removed from the Giglio Island, and dragged in the port of Genoa where it was dismantled. The refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were monitored, in the period between 14th and 27th of July, exploiting SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in crisis mode. The main targets of the monitoring system were: (i) the detection of possible spill of pollutant material from the vessel and (ii) to exclude that oil slicks, illegally produced by other vessels, could be improperly linked to the naval convoy during its transit along the route between the Giglio Island and the port of Genoa. Results point out that the adopted monitoring system, through the use of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can be profitably employed to monitor emergency phases related to single ship or naval convoy over wide areas and with a suitable temporal coverage. Furthermore, the refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were a success because no pollution was produced during the operations.","COSMO-SkyMed,Oil spill,Costa Concordia,SAR,Wreck,"
"a novel monostatic sar hrws imaging scheme for maritime surveillance","2016","This paper focuses on the problem of maritime surveillance for ship detection and proposes a novel monostatic SAR high resolution wide swath imaging scheme. The scheme changes the way that Scan SAR illuminates sub-scenes, and proposes a scanning mode using the prior information of ships' spatial distribution in each sub-scene. Firstly, a method based on range profiles is used to obtain the target number in each sub-scene. After that, the radar illuminates each sub-scene in a probability calculated by a transfer-probability matrix. Finally, a compress sensing algorithm is utilized to reconstruct each sub-scene using the obtained sparse aperture echo data, and the whole wide swath image is joint by putting all the sub-scenes together. Experimental results show that the proposed imaging scheme can get a wide swath image effectively without reducing the image resolution.","SAR imaging,marine radar,subscene reconstruction,image resolution,ship detection,matrix algebra,scanning mode,Range profile,Marine vehicles,monostatic SAR high resolution wide swath imaging scheme,Synthetic aperture radar,transfer probability matrix,ship spatial distribution information,sparse aperture echo data,ships,compress sensing algorithm,transfer-probability matrix,maritime surveillance,object detection,compressed sensing,synthetic aperture radar,search radar,image reconstruction,radar imaging,echo,Apertures,probability,Image resolution,Radar imaging,monostatic SAR HRWS imaging scheme,Imaging,Compressed Sensing,"
"integrated ship monitoring system for realtime maritime surveillance","2016","The paper introduces an integrated ship monitoring system, which has been designed and developed with the purpose of real-time maritime surveillance. The integrated system now provides ship information such as position, flag, type etc. over maritime in real-time through the automatic download, processing and visualization steps of data collected from terrestrial-and satellite-based automatic identification systems (AIS) and Sentinel-1. The collected AIS and FMCW radar data are the main source for the real-time remote maritime surveillance, and the SAR-based automatic ship detection system is operated as a SAR mode to integrate the past data because of a time delay in the Sentinel-1 acquisition. The radar and land-based AIS were installed at an ocean tower off the west coast of South Korea. This system will support a rapid and effective surveillance over a huge oceanic area.","Satellites,marine radar,ocean tower,Sentinel-1,radar detection,real-time,Marine vehicles,ship monitoring,CW radar,remote maritime surveillance,South Korea,ships,AIS,Oceans,Integrated system,search radar,FMCW radar data,Artificial intelligence,Real-time systems,integrated ship monitoring system,SAR based automatic ship detection system,automatic identification systems,Surveillance,FM radar,"
"benefits of terrasar-x - paz constellation for maritime surveillance","2014","This paper focuses on the benefits of constellations for maritime monitoring applications.
