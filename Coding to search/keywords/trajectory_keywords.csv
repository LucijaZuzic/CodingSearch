"feasibility study of gnss as navigation system to reach the moon","2015","Reaching the Moon poses very strict requirements in terms of performance, flexibility and cost for all the spacecraft subsystems. These requirements become more stringent if the mission is designed to be accomplished using a small spacecraft. The navigation subsystem is without any doubts essential and nowadays, several systems offer different solutions to the navigation problem. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) such as GPS, GLONASS, or the future Galileo and BeiDou systems, introduce an easier way to provide an autonomous on-board orbit determination system; they only require an on-board GNSS receiver, with low-cost, low-power consumption and limited mass and volume. While GNSS receivers have been already exploited with success for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), their use for very High Earth Orbit (HEO) up to the Moon altitude is still at the research stage. In this context, the purpose of the present work is to determine the potential achievable accuracy of a code-based GNSS receiver solution, during the whole trajectory to reach the Moon. GPS, Galileo, and GPS-Galileo combined (dual constellation) solutions are estimated, by considering constellations availability, pseudorange error factors and geometry factors. Unlike previous investigations, our study is making use of the very accurate multi-GNSS constellation simulator “Spirent GSS8000”, which supports simultaneously the GPS and Galileo systems with L1, L5, E1, and E5 frequency bands. The contribution of this study, clearly demonstrates that GNSS signals can be tracked up to the Moon׳s surface, but not with the current GNSS receiver׳s technology for terrestrial use. We consider and discuss a possible navigation solution that uses a double constellation GPS-Galileo receiver aided by an on board orbital filter system in order to improve the accuracy of the navigation solution and achieve the required sensitivity.","GNSS,GNSS receiver,Moon exploration,Moon Transfer Orbit (MTO),GPS,Space navigation,"
"online detection of anomaly behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2020","In the surveillance domain, timely detection of anomaly behaviors is very important and is a great challenge to human operators due to information overload, fatigue and inattention. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on trajectories have been proposed for this problem. However, these algorithms generally have problems such as complex parameter setting, unfaithful statistical model, not well-calibrated false alarm rate, poor ability of online learning and sequential anomaly detection, etc. The theory of conformal prediction was introduced to solve these problems by constructing the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector. Yet, it only considers position information of the targets and is not sensitive to velocity and course anomaly behaviors. And the run times are increasing as the increase of the data size, which is not appropriate for early warning surveillance application. In order to solve these problems, sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNCAD) and sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor inductive conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNICAD) based on multidimensional trajectories are proposed in this paper. Experiments in both simulated military scenario and realistic civilian scenario show the presented algorithm has a good performance to online detect anomaly behaviors and would have a wide prospect in early warning surveillance systems.","Multidimensional,Anomaly behavior,Trajectory,Online detection,"
"motion modeling and simulation of maritime autonomous surface ships in realistic environmental disturbances","2020","A novel modeling and simulation pipeline is proposed in this paper to predict the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion of MASS under realistic environmental disturbances. The MASS model consists of several physics-based differential equations that are built based on state-of-the-art studies. The onboard sensors are utilized to drive the MASS model to keep the consistent control input with the real ships. A build-in hydrodynamic database describes the motion characteristics of ships. Moreover, an actual sea database is developed based on the third-generation wave numerical model to reproduce the ocean characteristics in the simulation. The spatial-and time-varying environmental vector fields are obtained from the real sea database to ensure consistency with the real environment. Three real voyage cases are reproduced by the presented method. The simulation results are compared with the records from onboard sensors for validation. The RMSE of the simulated trajectories is 3.789', 3.110', and 1.318' under the single influence of disturbances due to the inappropriate description of the real sea. Under the coupling disturbances, the RMSE of trajectories reduces to 0.1829', 0.5249', and 0.4030'. Consequently, the results indicate that the ocean database accurately reflected the ocean characteristics realistically, and the presented method can effectively predict the motions of the real ship under the actual sea environmental disturbances.","onboard sensors,control system synthesis,state-of-the-art studies,third-generation wave numerical model,remotely operated vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,Marine vehicles,ship,Mathematical model,coupling disturbances,simulated trajectories,spatial- time-varying environmental vector fields,Predictive models,realistic environmental disturbances,ships,differential equations,hydrodynamic database,hydrodynamics,motion control,Databases,Oceans,position control,ocean database,motion modeling,motion characteristics,actual sea environmental disturbances,physics-based differential equations,Hydrodynamics,Numerical models,time series,six-degrees-of-freedom,actual sea database,mobile robots,MASS model,marine control,numerical analysis,consistent control input,ocean characteristics,"
"optimal maneuvering and control of cooperative vehicles as case study for maritime applications within harbors","2019","This paper presents the development of a networked control system for maritime applications within the joint project GALILEOnautic to enable autonomous shipping and optimal maneuvering in harbor environments. To achieve this objective, all networked vehicles estimate position, velocity, orientation and time dynamically using a maritime navigation filter. These vehicle states are broadcasted to a central computation unit via long term evolution (LTE) mobile communication in combination with virtual private network (VPN). After a data synchronization step, an optimization algorithm uses the vessel states to calculate model-based optimal trajectories for each networked participant. These trajectories consist of target positions at certain instants of time and optimal settings for the rudder and propulsion units which are used as feedforward variables for a local trajectory controller on each vessel. To compensate smaller errors due to model inaccuracies during trajectory calculation, a feedback control loop is also established. Beside active network participants, other vehicles can be considered as well using data which is broadcasted by the automatic identification system (AIS). This paper presents the promising results of GALILEOnautic demonstrating an encounter situation of two networked vessels and one disturbing, non-networked participant. To demonstrate how the approach is able to avoid critical situations, three different demonstrators with increasing complexity are shown: networked robots, unmanned surface vehicles, and a ship-handling simulator.","model inaccuracies,feedback,target positions,trajectory calculation,remotely operated vehicles,maritime navigation filter,model-based optimal trajectories,optimization algorithm,optimal control,LTE,harbor environments,VPN,local trajectory controller,feedback control loop,nonnetworked participant,ships,automatic identification system,autonomous shipping,networked vessels,central computation unit,feedforward,networked control system,virtual private network,AIS,optimisation,position control,rudder,data synchronization step,networked vehicles,networked robots,virtual private networks,maritime applications,networked participant,vehicle states,vessel states,active network participants,optimal maneuvering,trajectory control,unmanned surface vehicles,mobile robots,optimal settings,navigation,marine vehicles,collision avoidance,Long Term Evolution,propulsion units,joint project GALILEOnautic,long term evolution mobile communication,"
"a semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on ais data","2022","Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","Vessel trajectory classification,Variational autoencoder,Deep learning,Semi-supervised learning,Automatic identification system,"

"conflictfinder: mining maritime traffic conflict from massive ship trajectories","2017","Collision-free is one of the major safety concerns for maritime traffic management. To analyze the collision data and understand the cause of the collision can contribute the improvement of the maritime traffic safety and management. However, the real collisions is not always available to analyze. Based on a massive AIS trajectory data collected, we focus on mining the ships' movement behaviors those may bring a possible collision if they do not take any avoidance, called Maritime Traffic Conflict. Even though the maritime traffic conflict is a non-accident incident, the movement behaviors of maritime traffic conflict may have the similar behaviors of navigational collision for analysis. Thus, we propose ConflictFinder to provide a framework for maritime traffic conflict mining. Different from existing methods those focus on detecting the conflicts between two ships in a restricted water way, we discover the conflicts occurred by multi-ships in open sea. For analysis of maritime traffic conflicts, a prototype of ConflictFinder is implemented which helps with gaining a better understanding of traffic conflicts discovered and can be applied to the improvement of maritime traffic safety evaluation and management.","AIS Data,data mining,maritime traffic conflict,Safety,Marine vehicles,mining maritime traffic,massive AIS trajectory data,Trajectory Data Mining,massive ship trajectories,ships,collision data analysis,marine safety,maritime traffic safety evaluation,marine engineering,ship movement behaviors,maritime traffic safety management,Prototypes,Artificial intelligence,ConflictFinder,Conflict Detection,Maritime Traffic,Trajectory,navigational collision,restricted water way,open sea,maritime traffic safety,Navigation,Data mining,collision free,"
"research on ship abnormal behavior detection method based on graph neural network","2022","Because of the existing maritime intelligent supervision, ship abnormal behavior detection ignores the interdependence between different time series of ships and different abnormal behavior characteristics, which leads to poor real-time performance and limited detection accuracy of abnormal detection. This paper explores the mechanism of ship abnormal behavior monitoring and detection based on graph attention network. This mechanism uses a sliding window to generate fixed data input, uses graph attention network to capture the dependence between ship behavior characteristics, and determines the threshold of anomaly according to the sea environment set in this paper. In order to complete the online real-time detection of ship abnormal behavior with multivariate and multidimensional time series, improve the accuracy of ship abnormal behavior detection and reduce the blind area of VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) system monitoring.","ship abnormal behavior monitoring,VTS system,sea environment set,graph attention network,multivariate time series,graph neural network,Marine vehicles,neural nets,Mechatronics,ships,marine safety,VTS system monitoring,multidimensional time series,sliding window,Data models,object detection,vessel traffic service,Time series analysis,existing maritime intelligent supervision,online real-time detection,Real-time systems,graph theory,time series,ship abnormal behavior detection method,Trajectory,maritime supervision,fixed data input generation,Cognition,traffic engineering computing,ship abnormal behavior detection,abnormal behavior characteristics,ship behavior characteristics,"
"a ship movement classification based on automatic identification system (ais) data using convolutional neural network","2020","With a wide use of AIS data in maritime transportation, there is an increasing demand to develop algorithms to efficiently classify a ship’s AIS data into different movements (static, normal navigation and manoeuvring). To achieve this, several studies have been proposed to use labelled features but with the drawback of not being able to effectively extract the details of ship movement information. In addition, a ship movement is in a free space, which is different to a road vehicle’s movement in road grids, making it inconvenient to directly migrate the methods for GPS data classification into AIS data. To deal with these problems, a Convolutional Neural Network-Ship Movement Modes Classification (CNN-SMMC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The underlying concept of this method is to train a neural network to learn from the labelled AIS data, and the unlabelled AIS data can be effectively classified by using this trained network. More specifically, a Ship Movement Image Generation and Labelling (SMIGL) algorithm is first designed to convert a ship’s AIS trajectories into different movement images to make a full use of the CNN’s classification ability. Then, a CNN-SMMC architecture is built with a series of functional layers (convolutional layer, max-pooling layer, dense layer etc.) for ship movement classification with seven experiments been designed to find the optimal parameters for the CNN-SMMC. Considering the imbalanced features of AIS data, three metrics (average accuracy, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC)) are selected to evaluate the performance of the CNN-SMMC. Finally, several benchmark classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT)) are selected to compare with CNN-SMMC. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-SMMC has a better performance in the classification of AIS data.","Trajectory image,AUtomatic Identification System (AIS),Ship movement classification,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),"
"vessel sailing route extraction and analysis from satellite-based ais data using density clustering and probability algorithms","2023","The vessel Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected by satellites have the features of large coverage area and large data volume, and they are instantaneous discrete data rather than time-continuous data, so the data has large dispersion with many noise points. This poses a challenge for vessel sailing route extraction. This paper proposes a vessel sailing route extraction method which consists of the fast Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and the Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF) noise reduction algorithm. The method in this paper firstly improves the clustering discrimination method in the DBSCAN algorithm to separate trajectories in different directions. Secondly, this paper extracts a fast clustering algorithm based on the density clustering algorithm to reduce its computing time overhead with satellite big data. Finally, this paper proposes the KDE-based OF processing algorithm, which calculates the outlier probability distribution value of the trajectory points through the algorithm to eliminate the edge trajectory points with low probability distribution. Based on the actual satellite vessel AIS data, this paper conducts multi-method comparisons and performance analysis experiments. Experiments show that the proposed method has the best stability and advancement.","Vessel sailing route extraction,Kernel Density Estimation-based Outlier Factor (KDE-based OF),Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN),Automatic Identification System (AIS),"
"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"

"data-driven adaptive disturbance observers for model-free trajectory tracking control of maritime autonomous surface ships","2021","In this article, we address the disturbance/ uncertainty estimation of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs) with unknown internal dynamics, unknown external disturbances, and unknown input gains.

"characterization of an episode with elevated ozone concentrations","1976","A detailed analysis has been made of a seven day period in 1973, during which elevated ozone levels were observed at Ottawa. In addition to the ozone data, results are also presented for oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, total hydrocarbons and particulate matter. The particulates were analyzed for seven constituents, including the cations ammonium, calcium, sodium, potassium and lead and the anions sulfate and nitrate. Also measured were several other properties of the particulates, including the size distribution. It was found that none of the other gaseous pollutants showed any increase in concentration when high ozone levels were present. In contrast, the particulate matter did increase and several constituents, notably ammonium and sulfate, showed a dramatic rise. A comparison with ozone data from Toronto and upper New York state showed that the high ozone concentrations were widespread. A meteorological analysis showed that elevated ozone levels were associated with a Tropical air mass with a moderate southwesterly flow of air. Trajectory calculations were carried out to show the origin of the air over Ottawa before, during and after the period of increased ozone.",""

"joint trajectory tracking and recognition based on bi-directional nonlinear learning","2009","Motion trajectory is one of the most important cues for tracking and behavior recognition and can be widely applied to numerous fields. However, it is a difficult problem to directly model the spatio-temporal variations of trajectories due to their high dimensionality and nonlinearity. In this paper, we propose a joint trajectory tracking and recognition algorithm by combining a generative model derived from a bi-directional deep neural network (called “autoencoder”) into a Bayesian estimation framework. The “autoencoder” network embeds high-dimensional trajectories into a two-dimensional plane based on a peculiar training rule and learns a trajectory generative model by its inverse mapping. A set of plausible trajectories can be generated by the trajectory generative model. In the tracking process, the samples from the plausible trajectory set are weighted by a mixed likelihood and are resampled to obtain the target state estimation at each time step in spirit of the particle filtering. The trajectory identity is inferred by evaluating the improved Hausdorff distance between the estimated trajectory up to now and the truncated reference trajectories. Moreover, the trajectory recognition results are also used to guide the trajectory tracking for the next time. The experiments on tracking and recognizing handwritten digits show that the proposed approach can achieve both robust tracking and exact recognition in background clutter and partial occlusion.","Nonlinear dimensionality reduction,Trajectory generative model,Autoencoder network,Visual tracking,Improved Hausdorff distance,Particle filter,"

"augmented ship tracking under occlusion conditions from maritime surveillance videos","2020","Ship tracking provides crucial on-site microscopic kinematic traffic information which benefits maritime traffic flow analysis, ship safety enhancement, traffic control, etc., and thus has attracted considerable research attentions in the maritime surveillance community. Conventional ship tracking methods yield satisfied results by exploring distinct visual ship features in maritime images, which may fail when the target ship is partially or fully sheltered by obstacles (e.g., ships, waves, etc.) in maritime videos. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an augmented ship tracking framework via the kernelized correlation filter (KCF) and curve fitting algorithm. First, the KCF model is introduced to track ships in the consecutive maritime images and obtain raw ship trajectory dataset. Second, the data anomaly detection and rectification procedure are implemented to rectify the contaminated ship positions. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we implement the proposed framework and another three popular ship tracking models on the four typical ship occlusion videos.

"graph-based ship traffic partitioning for intelligent maritime surveillance in complex port waters","2023","Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is a critical component of intelligent maritime traffic surveillance. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to gain MSA accurately given the growing complexity of ship traffic patterns due to multi-ship interactions possibly involving classical manned ships and emerging autonomous ships. This study proposes a new traffic partitioning methodology to realise the optimal maritime traffic partition in complex waters. The methodology combines conflict criticality and spatial distance to generate conflict-connected and spatially compact traffic clusters, thereby improving the interpretability of traffic patterns and supporting ship anti-collision risk management. First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters. Therefore, this study makes significant contributions to intelligent maritime surveillance and provides a theoretical foundation for promoting maritime anti-collision risk management for the future mixed traffic of both manned and autonomous ships.","Graph partitioning,Intelligent maritime surveillance,Maritime safety,Maritime knowledge extraction,AIS data,"
"atmospheric river linked to extreme rainfall events over kerala in august 2018","2021","A multi-day atmospheric river (AR) in the second week of August 2018 was pivotal in causing extreme precipitation over south-west coast of India that eventually lead to record-breaking floods in the state of Kerala. Integrated water vapor transport (IVT) analysis depicted an intense and long-duration CAT 5 atmospheric river stretching from the Arabian Sea across South India into the Bay of Bengal. A high-pressure ridge over the eastern Arabian Sea and western India and a trough over the Bay of Bengal forming a subsection of monsoon wave-train was observed ahead of the flood event. The monsoon trough was exacerbated by the synchronous effect of a polar westerly jet trough that created an anomalous low-pressure region covering central and eastern India and a quasi-stationary depression over the Bay of Bengal. The system favored continuous supply of moisture from the Indian Ocean into Kerala. To locate major sources of moisture, the air parcels that rained out to generate extreme precipitation are tracked backwards using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT).

"joint multi-domain resource allocation and trajectory optimization in uav-assisted maritime iot networks","2023","The integration of Maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT) technology and unmanned aerial/surface vehicles (UAVs/USVs) has been emerging as a promising navigational information technique in intelligent ocean systems. In this article, we consider the UAV-assisted M-IoT network where USVs offload computation-intensive maritime tasks via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the UAV equipped with the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server subject to the UAV mobility. To improve the energy efficiency of offloading transmission and workload computation, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USVsâ€™ offloaded workload, transmit power, computation resource allocation, as well as the UAV trajectory subject to the USVsâ€™ latency requirements. Despite the nature of mixed discrete and non-convex programming of the formulated problem, we exploit the vertical decomposition and propose a two-layered algorithm for solving it efficiently. Specifically, the top-layered algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of optimizing the UAV trajectory based on the idea of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and the underlying algorithm is proposed to optimize the underlying multidomain resource allocation problem based on the idea of the Lagrangian multiplier method.

"application of ray tracing for beyond-line-of-sight maritime communication in evaporation ducts","2023","Atmospheric ducts provide a potential way to establish beyond-line-of-sight (B-LoS) links for maritime communications. Based on the ray tracing (RT) method, long distance propagation in the maritime evaporation duct environment is studied in this paper. The variations of horizontal distance and height are calculated according to the refractivity distribution. Eigenrays between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) are determined by tracing the ray trajectories. Furthermore, the path loss, delay spread, and angles of arrival (AoAs) are estimated. Simulation results calculated by the RT method match theoretical results generated by parabolic equation (PE) methods in the short range. In the B-LoS range, the path loss estimated by RT is a bit higher than that estimated by PE. In the RT model, the increase in the number of rays calculated in the B-LoS range may lead to this case. Simulation results show that the RT method can well evaluate the anomalous propagation in the evaporation duct and estimate channel parameters effectively.","long distance propagation,ray tracing,atmospheric ducts,Ducts,beyond-line-of-sight maritime communication,channel parameter estimation,ducts,horizontal distance variations,receiver,path loss,B-LoS links,path loss estimation,RT method,Wireless communication,Transmitters,anomalous propagation,delay estimation,channel estimation,evaporation duct,eigenrays,maritime evaporation duct environment,angle of arrival estimation,B-LoS range,parabolic equation methods,direction-of-arrival estimation,wireless channels,transmitter,parabolic equations,beyond-line-of-sight,marine communication,ray trajectories,Simulation,Receivers,Refractive index,delay spread,ray tracing method,refractive index,acoustic wave propagation,Ray tracing,refractivity distribution,"

"smoke aerosol transport patterns over the maritime continent","2013","Smoke transport patterns over the Maritime Continent (MC) are studied through a combination of approaches, including a) analyzing AODs obtained from satellite products; b) aerosol transport modeling with AOD assimilation along with the atmospheric flow patterns; c) analyzing smoke wet deposition distributions; and d) examining forward trajectories for smoke events defined in this study. It is shown that smoke transport pathways are closely related to the low-level atmospheric flow, i.e., during June–Sept, smoke originating from the MC islands with a dominant source over central and southern Sumatra, and southern and western Borneo, is generally transported northwestward south of the equator and northeastward north of the equator with the cross-equatorial flow, to the South China Sea (SCS), the Philippines and even further to the western Pacific. During the October–November transitional period, smoke transport paths are more zonally oriented compared to June–September. Smoke originating from Java, Bali, Timor etc, and southern New Guinea, which are in the domain of easterlies and southeasterlies during the boreal summer (June–November), is generally transported westward. It is also found that smoke transport over the MC exhibits multi-scale variability. Smoke typically lives longer and can be transported farther in El Niño years and later MJO phases compared with non El Niño years and earlier MJO phases. During El Niño periods there is much stronger westward transport to the east tropical Indian Ocean. Finally, orographic effect on smoke transport over the MC is also clearly discernable.","Aerosol transport,Smoke,El Niño,MJO,Smoke transport,Maritime Continent,"

"visualization and visual analysis of vessel trajectory data: a survey","2021","Maritime transports play a critical role in international trade and commerce. Massive vessels sailing around the world continuously generate vessel trajectory data that contain rich spatial–temporal patterns of vessel navigations. Analyzing and understanding these patterns are valuable for maritime traffic surveillance and management. As essential techniques in complex data analysis and understanding, visualization and visual analysis have been widely used in vessel trajectory data analysis. This paper presents a literature review on the visualization and visual analysis of vessel trajectory data. First, we introduce commonly used vessel trajectory data sets and summarize main operations in vessel trajectory data preprocessing. Then, we provide a taxonomy of visualization and visual analysis of vessel trajectory data based on existing approaches and introduce representative works in details.

"change in forest condition: characterizing non-stand replacing disturbances using time series satellite imagery","2020","Objective information is required to monitor and characterize disturbances and disturbance regimes as related to changing climate and anthropogenic pressures. Forest disturbances occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales, with varying extent, severity, and persistence. To date, most of our understanding of detecting forest disturbances using remotely sensed imagery has been based on detecting abrupt and rapid, stand replacing disturbances, such as those related to wildfire and forest harvesting. Conversely, more continuous, subtle, and gradual non-stand replacing (NSR) disturbances, such as those related to drought stress or insect infestation have been subject to less focus. This can be attributed to the variability of NSR in space and time, as well as detection difficulties due to their often-subtle alterations to forest canopies and structure. Time series remote sensing techniques offer new opportunities for the capture and characterization of NSR disturbances. In this research, we investigate NSR disturbances as detected using a Landsat time series-based disturbance detection algorithm, Composite2Change (C2C) applied to the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada. We first examined three key characteristics of the spectral trajectory of NSR disturbances: pre-disturbance conditions, disturbance severity and disturbance persistence. From these characteristics, we defined seven typical NSR patterns (exemplars) for Canada’s forested ecosystems. Using annual information on predicted stand-level cover and biomass, we found that all NSR exemplars resulted in a loss of canopy cover, ranging from an average loss of between 5 and 31%. For instance, the most common exemplar was linked to a 15% reduction in canopy cover and a 13 Mg/ha reduction in biomass. While stands lost biomass, over the duration of the NSR, most stands increased slightly in stand height likely due to growth of the remaining trees or release from competition from the remaining stems. Comparing exemplars across Canada with independent data on NSR disturbance events confirmed that NSR exemplars that had larger severities, and shorter disturbance persistence times, were more commonly associated with insect infestations (e.g. mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)), whereas exemplars with a lower severity, and longer persistence were more commonly associated with drought events. Developing a nomenclature around remote sensing based characteristics of NSR disturbances provides an approach to both map NSR disturbances and better understand their impact on forest attributes, as well as provide tools to assess if these disturbanes are changing over space and time.","Landsat,Time series,Land cover,Disturbance,Insects,drought,Land use,"
"unsupervised maritime traffic pattern extraction from spatio-temporal data","2015","Maritime traffic pattern extraction is a fundamental and crucial factor for maritime surveillance and anomaly detection. Emerging technologies like Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data which is used to construct a maritime traffic model. In this paper, we propose a framework of maritime traffic pattern extraction from vessel AIS information, which learns a traffic pattern using an unsupervised technique, and can be applied on historical Automatic Identification System data. AIS data is a kind of spatio-temporal data that contains information of location data, as well as time stamps. In this way, traffic pattern is described by AIS data. Furthermore, we conduct a simulation experiment that extracts traffic pattern from the AIS data through the unsupervised technique. The proposed framework takes advantage of AIS data, which is a type of the spatiotemporal data that consists of vessel motion information, to perform the experiment. The result shows that the unsupervised framework converts useful information from raw AIS data to effective traffic pattern. The proposed method strongly supports the further research on maritime traffic pattern extraction of AIS data. Besides, an overview of the framework and the unsupervised technique for high-level maritime situation awareness is presented.","Traffic control,Clustering algorithms,unsupervised learning,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,vessel AIS information,spatiotemporal data,data analysis,ships,automatic identification system,marine engineering,Automatic Identification System,maritime traffic pattern,AIS,maritime surveillance,Data models,feature extraction,Classification algorithms,identification,Trajectory,maritime situation awareness,maritime traffic pattern extraction,density-based clustering,Data mining,"
"framework for ship trajectory forecasting based on linear stationary models using automatic identification system","2022","Maritime surveillance is of utmost priority for a nation's security, and hence it's economy. For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model,Window Generator,Trajectory Forecast,Time Series Analysis,Automatic Identification System,Maritime Surveillance,"
"routeminer: mining ship routes from a massive maritime trajectories","2014","Mining trajectory data has been attracting significant interest in the last years. By analyzing trajectory data, we are able to discover the movement behavior and location-aware knowledge, and then develop many interesting applications such as movement behavior discovery, location prediction, traffic analysis, and so on. However, trajectory data mining is a challenge task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, discovering the valuable knowledge from maritime trajectory is made even more difficult due to the maritime area is a free moving space. Unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for ships to follow in maritime area. A ship's movement may not exactly repeat the same trajectory even the ship has the similar movement behavior with others. In this work, Route Miner system provides a framework of ship route mining for maritime traffic analysis. Given a set of ship trajectories in a maritime area, Route Miner explore the movement behavior from those massive trajectories in a free moving space. Then, ship routes are detected based on those behavioral pattern. Finally, the system generates a set of ships routes to provide operators a better understanding from ship trajectory data. We conduct the experiments on real maritime trajectories to show the effectiveness of proposed Route Miner. In the future, Route Miner is going to serve as the photo type for exploring the solutions of the challenges those related to anomaly detection and traffic management in the maritime domain.","data mining,Vectors,movement behavior,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,movement behavior discovery,traffic management,ship trajectories,Trajectory Data Mining,mining ship routes,ship route mining,Ship Route Mining,marine systems,maritime trajectories,Vehicles,trajectory data analysis,route miner system,Maritime Trajectory,trajectory data mining,maritime domain,behavioral pattern,maritime traffic analysis,Roads,location prediction,Trajectory,massive maritime trajectories,Uncertainty,road networks,Data mining,maritime area,location-aware knowledge,"

The space-bore synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations for ship and oil spill are verified by air-borne SAR observations and on-site observations. The accuracy of the forecasting trajectory is improved by integrating more observations. The uncertainty in the forecasting is accounted for by an ensemble of the available wind and current forcing, in order to improve the reliability of the conclusions.

"validation of xai explanations for multivariate time series classification in the maritime domain","2022","Due to the lack of explanation towards their internal mechanism, state-of-the-art deep learning-based classifiers are often considered as black-box models. For instance, in the maritime domain, models that classify the types of ships based on their trajectories and other features perform well, but give no further explanation for their predictions. To gain the trust of human operators responsible for critical decisions, the reason behind the classification is crucial. In this paper, we introduce explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches to the task of classification of ship types. This supports decision-making by providing explanations in terms of the features contributing the most towards the prediction, along with their corresponding time intervals. In the case of the LIME explainer, we adapt the time-slice mapping technique (LimeforTime), while for Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and path integrated gradient (PIG), we represent the relevance of each input variable to generate a heatmap as an explanation. In order to validate the XAI results, the existing perturbation and sequence analyses for classifiers of univariate time series data is employed for testing and evaluating the XAI explanations on multivariate time series. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation technique to assess the quality of explanations yielded by the chosen XAI method.","Explainability,Interpretability,Multivariate time series,Maritime domain,Machine learning,Black-box,"

Conventionally, Origin-Destination matrix data is utilized for event detection which has limitations such as removal of temporal aspect of data and inability to access to trajectory features such as speed of vessel from origin to destination. To utilize aforementioned features available in Automatic information system (AIS), we formulate the problem in a novel way, by detecting anomalies in a set of directed graphs representing the movement pattern at each time interval.

"holocene changes in biomass burning in the boreal northern hemisphere, reconstructed from anhydrosugar fluxes in an arctic sediment profile","2023","The rapid warming of Arctic is causing increased fire activities in the boreal Northern Hemisphere (NH), leading to unprecedent changes in the global carbon cycling, human health and ecosystems. Understanding the interaction between fire and climate in this far north region is crucial for predicting future changes of wildfires. However, fire records over geological time scales are still scarce in the high latitudes of NH to provide comprehensive pictures of the fire history in this region. Here, we used the flux of levoglucosan (Lev) and its isomers in a sediment profile YN from Svalbard, high Arctic, as proxies for the changes in biomass burning from ∼9–2 kyr BP (thousand years before present). Backward trajectories and comparison with charcoal syntheses from various regions confirmed that the Lev transport to the profile site is sourced from the fire activities in the boreal NH, especially in northern Europe and northern Siberia. The Lev flux exhibited a slight overall decreasing trend at ∼3 %/kyr (p = 0.09) over the study period, as well as centennial maxima at ∼9, 8–7, 6, 5, and 4–3 kyr BP (p = 0.06). On sub-orbital scales, the long-term decrease in fire activities corresponded to trends of summer temperature in the extratropics of the NH (p = 0.01, r = 0.42), reflecting their regulation of fuel availability and flammability. On centennial to sub-millennial time scales, high levels of biomass burning were associated with periods of increased North Atlantic ice-rafted debris (p = 0.02, r = 0.38), which were indicative of cold and dry conditions over most of the source regions, reflecting the impacts of dryness on fuel flammability. The results suggested that enhanced Arctic amplification on centennial time scales may reduce biomass burning in most of the boreal NH, although fires in some mid-latitude regions may be facilitated.","Fire history,Anhydrosugar,Ny-Ålesund,Levoglucosan,Holocene,Arctic,Climate change,Northern Hemisphere,"
"a fully-autonomous framework of unmanned surface vehicles in maritime environments using gaussian process motion planning","2023","Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are of increasing importance to a growing number of sectors in the maritime industry, including offshore exploration, marine transportation, and defense operations. A major factor in the growth in use and deployment of USVs is the increased operational flexibility that is offered through use of optimized motion planners that generate optimized trajectories. Unlike path planning in terrestrial environments, planning in the maritime environment is more demanding as there is need to assure mitigating action is taken against the significant, random, and often unpredictable environmental influences from winds and ocean currents. With the focus on these necessary requirements as the main basis of motivation, this article proposes a novel motion planner, denoted as Gaussian process motion planning 2 star (GPMP2*), extending the application scope of the fundamental Gaussian-process-based motion planner, Gaussian process motion planning 2 (GPMP2), into complex maritime environments. An interpolation strategy based on Monte Carlo stochasticity has been innovatively added to GPMP2* to produce a new algorithm named GPMP2* with Monte Carlo stochasticity, which can increase the diversity of the paths generated. In parallel with algorithm design, a robotic operating system (ROS)-based fully-autonomous framework for an advanced USV, the Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel 20, has been proposed.

"a novel ship trajectory clustering method for finding overall and local features of ship trajectories","2021","Ship trajectory clustering is one of the main methods of ship trajectory mining based on AIS data. However, there exist two main problems in trajectory clustering: One is the inherent problem of the clustering algorithm, such as low computational efficiency, poor recognition of noise, sensitivity to the density distribution of data, etc.; the other problem is about the similarity measurement of the trajectories, that is, most of the measurement methods ignore the overall motion trend or local features of ship trajectories. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes the FOLFST, a novel ship trajectory clustering method for Finding Overall and Local Features of Ship Trajectories, which consists of four parts: 1) segment the trajectory with the ADP (Adaptive-threshold Douglas-Peucker) algorithm; 2) adopt new sub-trajectory segments similarity measurement method which considers both the wholeness and locality of the trajectory; 3) cluster the sub-trajectory segments with the improved FOP-OPTICS (Finding of the Ordering Peaks Based on OPTICS); 4) identify sub-trajectories which belong to multiple clusters. The experimental results show that the FOLFST has obvious advantages over the other four algorithms in identifying the overall and local features of ship trajectories, noise recognition, computational efficiency, etc.","Sub-trajectory clustering,Ship trajectory,AIS,Similarity measurement,"

"framestep: a framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes","2018","We are witnessing an increasing usage of location data by a variety of applications. Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place.

"el niño driven haze over the southern malaysian peninsula and borneo","2020","The Southeast Asian (SEA) region is no stranger to forest fires - the region has been suffering from severe air pollution (known locally as ‘haze’) as a result of these fires, for decades. The fires in SEA region are caused by a combination of natural (the El Niño weather pattern) and manmade (slash-and-burn and land clearing for plantations) factors. These fires cause the emissions of toxic aerosols and pollutants that can affect millions of people in the region. Thus, this study aims to identify the impact of the SEA haze on the Southern region of the Malaysian Peninsula and Borneo region of East Malaysia using the entire air quality observation data at surface level in 2015. Overall, the concentration of PM10 was about two-fold higher during the haze period compared to non-haze period. The concentrations of CO, flux of CO and flux of BC were aligned with PM10 during the entire observation period. The wind field and cluster of trajectory indicated that the Southern Malaysian Peninsula and Borneo were influenced mainly from the wildfires and the combustion of peat soil in the Indonesian Borneo.

For stationary features, we find that all but a small subset of the features are observable. For moving features, we show that an important class of feature and ASV trajectories are not observable.","Remotely operated vehicles,Kalman filters,remotely operated vehicles,robot vision,Cameras,nonlinear systems,observability,Simultaneous localization and mapping,nonwater object detection,Observability,Vehicle detection,stationary features,omnidirectional camera,nonlinear control systems,local observability analysis,Mobile robots,moving features,Instruments,Hazards,maritime environment,mobile robots,autonomous surface vehicle operation,Object detection,Navigation,ASV kinematics,marine vehicles,robot kinematics,feature localization,"
"contextual verification for false alarm reduction in maritime anomaly detection","2015","Automated vessel anomaly detection is immensely important for preventing and reducing illegal activities (e.g., drug dealing, human trafficking, etc.) and for effective emergency response and rescue in a country's territorial waters. A major limitation of previously proposed vessel anomaly detection techniques is the high rate of false alarms as these methods mainly consider vessel kinematic information which is generally obtained from AIS data. In many cases, an anomalous vessel in terms of kinematic data can be completely normal and legitimate if the 'context' at the location and time (e.g., weather and sea conditions) of the vessel is factored in. In this paper, we propose a novel anomalous vessel detection framework that utilizes such contextual information to reduce false alarms through 'contextual verification'. We evaluate our proposed framework for vessel anomaly detection using massive amount of real-life AIS data sets obtained from U.S. Coast Guard. Though our study and developed prototype is based on the maritime domain the basic idea of using contextual information through 'contextual verification' to filter false alarms can be applied to other domains as well.","Kinematics,AIS Data,emergency management,vessel kinematic information,Contextual Verification,Trajectory Clustering,Anomaly Detection,contextual verification,US coast guard,Meteorology,False Alarm Reduction,illegal activities,marine engineering,automated vessel anomaly detection,false alarms,Big data,contextual information,Context,false alarm reduction,maritime anomaly detection,Real-time systems,emergency response,Tracking,Trajectory,territorial waters,AIS data,"
"historical ais data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction of directional maritime traffic networks","2020","Vessel experience route analysis can provide empirical support for maritime traffic management. Recently, the application of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides multi-dimensional data about voyages and vessels. However, traditional route extraction methods do not take into account information such as the vessel traffic pattern and the density distribution in the channel. The experience routes obtained is not accurate enough. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for extracting vessel experience routes from historical AIS data. The method consists of three parts: vessel traffic pattern extraction, channel boundary extraction, channel triangle network construction and hottest route extraction. The method comprehensively considers the spatiotemporal information and density distribution of the vessel trajectories, and constructs a directional maritime traffic network which can effectively convert historical data into information supporting decision-making.","Traffic control,vessel experience route analysis,data mining,Clustering algorithms,Kernel,empirical support,historical data,unsupervised method,Feature extraction,historical AIS data-driven unsupervised automatic extraction,Directional Maritime Traffic Network,maritime traffic management,vessel traffic pattern extraction,information supporting decision-making,channel triangle network construction,multidimensional data,density distribution,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,Traffic Pattern,channel boundary extraction,pattern clustering,decision making,Artificial intelligence,vessel trajectories,Trajectory,Triangular Network,traffic engineering computing,directional maritime traffic network,Data mining,voyages,vessel experience routes,"

"maritime anomaly detection based on mean-reverting stochastic processes applied to a real-world scenario","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure is presented, based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) device for a certain time, and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity. The decision that has to be taken is either declaring that a deviation happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables for the solution of the anomaly detection problem.","real-world data,Anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,security of data,maritime security,Stochastic processes,proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure,target tracking,statistical analysis,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,OU process long-term velocity parameter,automatic identification system,automatic identification system device,stochastic processes,marine engineering,AIS,nominal velocity,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,vessel switches,Trajectory,statistical hypothesis test,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,Transponders,planned route,Navigation,"
"self-adaption vessel traffic behaviour recognition algorithm based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics","2020","Clustering analysis is commonly used for vessel traffic behaviour recognition. The clustering results reflect the characteristics of different vessel traffic behaviours, which can assist authorities in transportation management. However, there are two drawbacks to traditional clustering analysis. First, the similarity measures among different trajectories in a clustering analysis mainly focus on spatial differentiation and frequently do not consider motion features, such as speed and course. Second, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a famous clustering analysis method, is characterized by poor self-adaption, which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets. These issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis. To address these problems, a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories. The proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories. Furthermore, the Parzen window (a non-parametric estimation method) and the multivariate Gaussian distribution are employed to generate self-adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm for a given sample set. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved DBSCAN algorithm. The clustering analysis results obtained with the proposed method could provide insights towards better monitoring and navigation advice to help improve marine managerial effectiveness and avoid maritime accidents.","Vessel behaviour recognition,Self-adaption,Multi-attribute trajectory characteristics,DBSCAN,"
"gpu-accelerated compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories in maritime iot industries","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression imperative and challenging. This article mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories and their graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations. The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","trajectory compression,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,vessel trajectory data quality,trajectory visualization,Internet of Things,Industries,GPU-accelerated compression,large-scale vessel trajectories,data visualisation,Acceleration,compression threshold,vessel trajectory,parallel computing,ships,KDE-based visualization,marine safety,kernel density estimation,marine engineering,GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks,maritime transportation,graphics processing units,automatic identification system,collision avoidance services,maritime IoT industries,intelligent traffic management,compressed vessel trajectories,KDE algorithm,Artificial intelligence,AIS-based vessel trajectory data,data compression,Data visualization,graphics processing unit (GPU),graphics processing unit,Graphics processing units,Trajectory,maritime Internet-of-Things industries,large-scale AIS data,marine vehicles,automatic vessel-tracking system,"
"ship collision avoidance behaviour recognition and analysis based on ais data","2022","A novel approach is proposed to automatically identify the ship collision avoidance behaviour from ship trajectories based on an improved Sliding Window Algorithm. The approach has three main stages: (1) determining the ships’ obligations according to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs); (2) assessing the rudder angle according to the true bearing of the target ship; (3) identifying the corresponding ship handling behaviour from the ship trajectory taking into account the Rate of Turn and its derivative based on the Sliding Window Algorithm. Four typical encounter scenarios are studied to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach is then applied to near collision scenarios identified in the maritime traffic off the continental coast of Portugal, which allowed the characterization of the relative and spatial distributions of the locations at which the ships take evasive manoeuvres. The results show that the approach can be applied to accurately detect the ship collision avoidance behaviour from Automatic Identification System trajectory data, and the characterization of the collision avoidance behaviour can potentially be used by situational awareness systems and as the basis for ship collision avoidance decision-making.","Ship evasive manoeuvring,Near collision scenario,Collision avoidance,Sliding window Algorithm,"
"uav-enabled accompanying coverage for hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial maritime communications","2019","Despite of constantly-developing satellites and terrestrial fifth generation (5G) communications, there is still a large gap for maritime broadband coverage. In this paper, we explore the potential gain of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for maritime communications. A hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network is considered, where the UAV is employed to offer an accompanying coverage for mobile ships. We optimize both the trajectory and transmit power of UAV to maximize the minimum of ship's achievable rate. Different from previous studies, we consider a typical composite channel model containing both large-scale and small-scale fading, to cope with the practical propagation environment. Moreover, we assume only the large-scale channel state information (CSI) is known for optimization, because the dynamic small-scale fading cannot be obtained before UAV's flight, whereas the large-scale CSI can be estimated according to the position information of ships. Under this context, an optimization problem is formulated, subject to constraints on UAV's kinematics and communication limitation. We solve the problem which is proved to be non-convex by problem decomposition, successive convex optimization and bisection searching tools.

"energy-efficient trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2022","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAVâ€™s energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAVâ€™s flight trajectory subject to wind effect. The conventional successive convex approximation (SCA) method can provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered wind effect, while the computational/trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework with tailored initialization algorithm that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently, as well as a hybrid offline-online (HO2) design that leverages convex stochastic programming (CSP) offline based on wind statistics, and refines the solution by adapting online to real-time wind velocity. Numerical results show that our optimized trajectory can better adapt to various setups with different target data volume and buoysâ€™ topology as well as various wind speed/direction/variance compared with benchmark schemes. In particular, our proposed HO2 design can effectively adapt to random wind variations with feasible and robust online operation, and proactively exploit the wind for further energy savings in both single-buoy and multi-buoy scenarios.","unmanned aerial vehicles,wind statistics,wind effect,aircraft power systems,successive convex approximation,Energy consumption,SCA,convex programming,energy-efficient trajectory design,control engineering computing,hybrid offline-online design,trajectory complexity,Wireless communication,flight trajectory,data acquisition,single-buoy scenarios,real-time wind velocity,target data volume,communication time scheduling,oceanic exploration,UAV-aided maritime data collection system,Maritime data collection,HO2 design,random wind variations,hybrid offline-online (HO2),trajectory initialization,Wind speed,unmanned aerial vehicle,wind direction,energy savings,marine buoys,convex stochastic programming,Real-time systems,autonomous aerial vehicles,wind speed,wind,trajectory control,Trajectory,energy consumption,cyclical trajectory design,computational complexity,mobile robots,energy conservation,sub-optimal solutions,stochastic programming (SP),aerospace computing,Task analysis,multibuoy scenarios,Data collection,approximation theory,stochastic programming,fixed-wing UAV,CSP,"
"synthetic trajectory extraction for maritime anomaly detection","2018","In the maritime domain, the main goal for large vessels is to drive as fast and efficiently as possible from one harbour to the next. This results in vessels following quite distinct routes. Deviations from these routes can be seen as indicators for illegal or at least suspicious behaviour. In order to extract these routes, clustering algorithms can be used, that will store the traffic patterns as synthetic trajectories. A vessel can be assigned to a specific route or a deviation from the routes can be detected by evaluating these route models. A challenge in designing the synthetic trajectories lies in the faithful representation, sparsity of data, treatment of outliers and split-up of routes. Here, a novel approach to model the uncertainty of the vessels movements while following a route is introduced: A cluster is now represented by a trajectory consisting of segments. Due to obstacles like shallow waters, a route might split up which will generate sub-segments. Instead of storing all cluster points, the position, speed, and course of the vessels are attached to each segment in form of normal distributions. Using these attributes, the probability of a deviation from the given trajectory can be estimated.","Clustering algorithms,Kernel,vessels movements,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,traffic patterns,security of data,trajectory representation,ships,clustering algorithms,marine engineering,maritime domain,Heating systems,route models,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,synthetic trajectory extraction,Trajectory,data sparsity,probability,Gaussian distribution,data handling,"

"drivers and trajectories of land cover change in east africa: human and environmental interactions from 6000 years ago to present","2018","East African landscapes today are the result of the cumulative effects of climate and land-use change over millennial timescales. In this review, we compile archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data from East Africa to document land-cover change, and environmental, subsistence and land-use transitions, over the past 6000 years. Throughout East Africa there have been a series of relatively rapid and high-magnitude environmental shifts characterised by changing hydrological budgets during the mid- to late Holocene. For example, pronounced environmental shifts that manifested as a marked change in the rainfall amount or seasonality and subsequent hydrological budget throughout East Africa occurred around 4000, 800 and 300 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). The past 6000 years have also seen numerous shifts in human interactions with East African ecologies. From the mid-Holocene, land use has both diversified and increased exponentially, this has been associated with the arrival of new subsistence systems, crops, migrants and technologies, all giving rise to a sequence of significant phases of land-cover change. The first large-scale human influences began to occur around 4000 yr BP, associated with the introduction of domesticated livestock and the expansion of pastoral communities. The first widespread and intensive forest clearances were associated with the arrival of iron-using early farming communities around 2500 yr BP, particularly in productive and easily-cleared mid-altitudinal areas. Extensive and pervasive land-cover change has been associated with population growth, immigration and movement of people. The expansion of trading routes between the interior and the coast, starting around 1300 years ago and intensifying in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries CE, was one such process. These caravan routes possibly acted as conduits for spreading New World crops such as maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), although the processes and timings of their introductions remains poorly documented. The introduction of southeast Asian domesticates, especially banana (Musa spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), and chicken (Gallus gallus), via transoceanic biological transfers around and across the Indian Ocean, from at least around 1300 yr BP, and potentially significantly earlier, also had profound social and ecological consequences across parts of the region. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of information and metadatasets, we explore the different drivers and directions of changes in land-cover, and the associated environmental histories and interactions with various cultures, technologies, and subsistence strategies through time and across space in East Africa. This review suggests topics for targeted future research that focus on areas and/or time periods where our understanding of the interactions between people, the environment and land-cover change are most contentious and/or poorly resolved. The review also offers a perspective on how knowledge of regional land-use change can be used to inform and provide perspectives on contemporary issues such as climate and ecosystem change models, conservation strategies, and the achievement of nature-based solutions for development purposes.","LandCover6k,Archaeology,Pastoralism,Palaeoenvironments,Savannah,Agriculture,Pottery,Iron technology,Livelihoods,Land use,Sustainable Development Goals,"

"adaptive marine traffic behaviour pattern recognition based on multidimensional dynamic time warping and dbscan algorithm","2023","Identifying marine traffic behaviour patterns is important for intelligent maritime traffic management systems. The introduction of Automatic Identification System (AIS), which can record speed over ground (SOG) and course over ground (COG) data, makes these patterns accessible. Based on that, a novel adaptive marine traffic behaviour pattern recognition algorithm is proposed to explore potential traffic behaviour patterns. In the proposed recognition algorithm, multidimensional dynamic time warping is introduced to measure the similarity among trajectories; this process considers both the spatial and motion characteristics of trajectories. However, the computational complexity of multidimensional dynamic time warping is high. To reduce the number of required computations, a data simplification algorithm considering ship behaviours is adopted to compress trajectories and, therefore, to achieve an improved computation ability. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is utilized to classify marine traffic behaviour patterns. Due to the poor adaptation of the DBSCAN algorithm, we design a local mean density to evaluate the trajectory density distribution in the given dataset and then determine the optimal parameters in DBSCAN according to the local mean density gradient to improve the adaptivity of the algorithm. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical experiments involving U.S. east coastal waters.

"extraction of maritime road networks from large-scale ais data","2019","Extracting road network information including lane boundaries, lane centerlines, junctions and their relationship from AIS data plays an important role in location based services, urban computing and intelligent transportation systems, etc. However, AIS data are large scale, high noisy, the density and quality are very uneven in different areas, extracting a whole, continuous and smooth maritime road network with rich information from such data is a challenging problem. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive maritime road network extraction approach that can extract both lane boundaries and centerlines for a large sea area from AIS data.

"learning for prediction of maritime collision avoidance behavior from ais network","2021","With the rapid increase in global maritime shipping, there is a great demand for the technology of maritime traffic monitoring to detect inappropriate encountering interaction between ships and prevent ship collision accidents. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect a large volume of maritime traffic data and investigate the collision avoidance behavior of real-world ships. Most collision avoidance systems are based on expert systems and simulations based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Those regulations outline the general principles underlying collision avoidance; however, they do not provide specific guidance and fail to account for the complexity of many real-world situations. Furthermore, guidance systems coordinating the movement of a ship must have the capacity to predict the movement behavior of all ships involved in potential encounter situations, and do so as early as possible for anti-collision reaction. Our objective in this study was to model the collision avoidance behaviors of human operators in order to formulate a set of realistic trajectory predictions for encountering near collision scenarios. By machine learning approach, the proposed framework is able to learn a model of interaction movement behavior from collected AIS historical traffic data involving near collision situations and then generate a set of predicted trajectories while ships encountering. The proposed model eliminates the need for a priori information related to environmental conditions and the rules governing encounter situations.

"research on detection mechanism of vessel abnormal behavior based on immune genetic spectral clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime transport accounts for over 90% of global trade, and maritime safety has been confirmed as a vital issue of maritime transport. Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate, it facilitates the intelligent and automatic management of vessels by the VTS system.","Immune genetic,Abnormal behavior detection,Automatic identification system (AIS),Spectral clustering,Duplicato-degree measurement,Intelligent vessel supervision,"

"on the effectiveness of ai-assisted anomaly detection methods in maritime navigation","2020","The automatic identification system (AIS) has become an essential tool for maritime security. Nevertheless, how to effectively use the static and dynamic voyage information of the AIS data in maritime traffic situation awareness is still a challenge. This paper presents a comparative study of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on their effectiveness in dealing with various anomalies in maritime domain using the AIS data. The AIS on-off switching (OOS) anomaly is critical in maritime security, since AIS technology is susceptible to manipulation and it can be switched on and off to hide illegal activities. Thus, we try to detect and distinguish between intentional and non-intentional AIS OOS anomalies through our AI -assisted anomaly detection framework. We use AIS data, in particular positional and navigational status of vessels, to study the effectiveness of seven AI techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes, in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies. Our experimental results show that ANN and SVM are the most suitable techniques in detecting the AIS OOS anomalies with 99.9% accuracy. Interestingly, the ANN model outperforms others when trained with a balanced (i.e., same order of samples per class) dataset, and SVM, on the other hand, is suitable when training dataset is unbalanced.","maritime traffic situation awareness,AI-assisted anomaly detection,decision trees,Support vector machines,logistic regression,Anomaly detection,static voyage information,random forests,ANN,marine navigation,Feature extraction,security of data,maritime security,k-nearest neighbors,regression analysis,AIS technology,naive Bayes,neural nets,naive Bayes methods,automatic identification system,marine safety,marine engineering,support vector machines,maritime navigation,dynamic voyage information,maritime domain,random forest,SVM,Artificial intelligence,AIS on-off switching anomaly,nearest neighbour methods,artificial neural network,Training,Trajectory,support vector machine,nonintentional AIS OOS anomalies,Navigation,artificial intelligence,decision tree,AIS data,"
"proactive collision avoidance for autonomous ships: leveraging machine learning to emulate situation awareness","2021","Autonomous ship technology is developing at a rapid pace, with the aim of facilitating safe ship operations. Collision avoidance is one of the most critical tasks that autonomous ships must handle. To support the level of safety associated with collision avoidance, this study suggests to provide autonomous ships with the ability to conduct proactive collision avoidance maneuvers. Proactive collision avoidance entails predicting future encounter situations, such that they can preemptively be avoided. However, any such actions must adhere to relevant navigation rules and regulations. As such, it is suggested to predict encounter situations far in advance, i.e. prior to risk of collision existing. Any actions can, therefore, be conducted prior to the applicability of the COLREGs. As such, simple corrective measures, e.g. minor speed and/or heading alterations, can prevent close encounter situations from arising, reducing the overall risk associated with autonomous ship operations, as well as improving traffic flow. This study suggests to facilitate this ability by emulating the development of situation awareness in ship navigators through machine learning. By leveraging historical AIS data to serve as artificial navigational experience, long-range trajectory predictions can be facilitated in a similar manner those conducted by human navigators, where such predictions provide the basis for proactive collision avoidance actions. The development of human situation awareness is, therefore, presented, and relevant machine learning techniques are discussed to emulate the same mechanisms.","Situation Awareness,Machine Learning,Collision Avoidance,Autonomous Ships,"

"“ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of china's lng trade","2023","Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean and low-carbon energy source that plays an important role in combating global warming. As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","Multidimensional analysis,Ship trajectory data,China's LNG trade,LNG trade,Fine-grained trade characteristics,"
"maritime buoyage inspection system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle and active disturbance rejection control","2021","The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is inexpensive and offers a fast response speed and robust flexibility; thus, it is a promising tool in the maritime buoyage inspection scenario, which involves monitoring and accessing a lateral mark system far away from the coast. However, two main problems can occur during inspection. The first is extreme weather conditions, resulting in a deviation between the inspection route and the design route. The second is that the buoyage beacons are visited only once. Therefore, this article proposes a buoyage inspection system consisting of a single UAV and random coastal buoys. The UAV automatically takes off from the depot, performs a self-check on the buoy beacons, and then returns to the depot. A cascade active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) is designed to adjust the real-time trajectory of the UAV system. A feasible trajectory planning method is also designed based on the continuous Hopfield neural network (CHNN) and genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the inspection distance.

"trajectory pattern extraction and anomaly detection for maritime vessels","2021","Trajectory analysis and extraction of trajectory patterns are crucial to enhance marine safety and marine status awareness. The major data source for such analysis is Automatic Identification System (AIS), which publishes data related to movement of the ship while cruising. AIS broadcasts information including type of ship, identity number, state, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), location, speed, direction, and cargo. In this paper, we focus on extracting a variety of trajectory patterns for maritime vessels. The first group of analysis we focus on is arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, which are useful to aid maritime operators. We propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. As the second type of analysis, anomaly detection on marine vessel trajectory is studied.

"object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pixelwise rigidity criterion and application to maritime target recognition","2014","This paper describes a novel approach for rigid object segmentation from a dynamic background using a pre-recorded video with a moving camera, and we apply it to the problem of vessel segmentation in a maritime video scene. The difficulty of modeling background appearance or/and dynamic, modeling object appearance, and compensating camera motion renders this task very challenging. Therefore, the proposed method only uses a geometric constraint regarding target motion rigidity in order to achieve object segmentation in a full video segment. Such an idea is not new in object segmentation literature, but the novelty in this paper resides in that the target rigidity assumption is implemented at the pixel level, but not at the object scale. This is firstly achieved by deriving a theoretical optic flow model in the neighborhood of each pixel under the 3D rigid motion assumption of object, which is later compared against the observed 2D optic flow model in the neighborhood of a pixel in order to derive a pixelwise rigidity criterion. The latter is further reenforced along individual (pixel) trajectories in a video segment. Finally, a mere thresholding operation allows to quickly extract target from background in a full video segment. Our experiments using real maritime video sequences captured with an airborne camera have shown that the method detects maritime targets accurately.","Optical imaging,rigid object segmentation,maritime target detection,dynamic background,motion compensation,Cameras,background appearance modeling,Solid modeling,object segmentation,2D optic flow model,maritime video sequences,pixel trajectories,vessel segmentation problem,prerecorded video,Integrated optics,marine engineering,Three-dimensional displays,object appearance modeling,maritime target recognition,object detection,geometric constraint,rigid object,Object segmentation,video signal processing,moving camera,maritime video scene,nonrigid dynamic background,Motion segmentation,optic flow,image sequences,pixelwise rigidity criterion,image sensors,computational geometry,image segmentation,airborne camera,object recognition,camera motion compensation,"
"maritime traffic monitoring based on vessel detection, tracking, state estimation, and trajectory prediction","2012","Maneuvering vessel detection and tracking (VDT), incorporated with state estimation and trajectory prediction, are important tasks for vessel navigational systems (VNSs), as well as vessel traffic monitoring and information systems (VTMISs) to improve maritime safety and security in ocean navigation.

"influence of atmospheric circulation and local parameters on activity concentration of gross alpha and gross beta in granada, spain","2023","This work analyses the influence of local meteorology and air mass origin on radioactivity levels measured in Granada (Southern Spain). To the scope, gross α and gross β activities at ground-level air were weekly recorded from 2006 to 2021, by collecting aerosol filters and successively analysing them by low-level proportional counting. Time series decomposition shows a strong correlation between the seasonal components of gross α and gross β and the local meteorological parameters, in particular temperature and wind speed. Back trajectories reaching the study area during the sampling, calculated at three height levels (750 m, 1500 m, and 3000 m a.s.l.), were analysed by three methods with the aim to determine the main characteristics of air masses reaching Granada, and their impact on airborne radioactivity levels. The results of the residence time and clustering analyses showed that an increase in the radioactivity levels in the southeast of Spain is connected with air masses coming from the Mediterranean at 750 m and from the South (Sahara Desert) at 3000 m. In line with the outcomes obtained by the cluster analysis, the Concentration Weighted Trajectory (WCWT) results highlight that the air masses transported from Mediterranean and African regions are a potential source of gross α and gross β. Moreover, the findings of the WCWT bring a new aspect by revealing that the southern France region can also have a significant contribution to gross alpha and beta activities.","Gross alpha,Radioactivity,Back-trajectories,Gross beta,Air masses,"

"mvffnet: multi-view feature fusion network for imbalanced ship classification","2021","The accurate classification of moving ships is of fundamental importance to maritime authorities for ensuring the safety and security of shipping operations. With the wide use of automatic identification systems (AISs), which allow ships to receive identification/location information from nearby ships, it is feasible to classify the types of ships by analysing ship behaviour from AIS-based trajectories. However, the imbalanced features of AIS data make it difficult to achieve satisfactory classification results in the presence of several different types of ships. To overcome these potential limitations, we propose a multi-view feature fusion network (MVFFNet) to achieve accurate ship classification with imbalanced data. To guarantee the powerful representation and generalization abilities of MVFFNet, we first extract several multi-view features (i.e., motion features and morphological features) from AIS-based ship trajectories. Several kinematic variables related to ship behaviour are empirically adopted as motion features. The morphological features are automatically extracted via convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) networks. CAE networks are capable of optimally learning the features from informative trajectory images, which are strictly related to the original ship trajectories. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) network is then proposed to combine multi-view features to generate the ship classification results. In addition, a hybrid loss function is presented to handle the imbalance problem of ship types, potentially leading to enhanced robustness and accuracy of ship classification. Comprehensive experiments on two realistic datasets have demonstrated that our proposed MVFFNet consistently outperforms other competing methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.","Ship classification,BiGRU,Imbalanced data,Multi-view feature fusion,CAE,"
"robust infrared maritime target detection via anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency","2022","When detecting diverse infrared (IR) small maritime targets on complicated scenes, the existing methods get into trouble and unsatisfactory performance. The main reasons are as follows: 1) affected by target characteristics and ambient temperature and so on, both bright and dark targets may exist on IR maritime images in practical application and 2) spatial information and temporal correlation of targets are not fully excavated. To these problems, we propose a robust anti-jitter spatialâ€“temporal trajectory consistency (ASTTC) method, the main idea of which is to improve detection accuracy using single-frame detection followed by multi-frame decision. First, we innovatively design adaptive local gradient variation (ALGV) descriptor, which combines local dissimilarity measure with gradient magnitude distribution to enhance the local contrast for both bright and dark targets so that the suspected targets can be robustly extracted. For multi-frame decision, interframe displacement correction is necessary to eliminate the interference of IR imager motion and vibration for target codeword. We use pyramid optical flow to track feature point extracted by Shi-Tomasi to capture interframe registration coefficients. Then, the target position is corrected in the spatialâ€“temporal domain. Finally, a robust spatialâ€“temporal trajectory descriptor (STTD), which achieves target encoding and target trajectory consistency measurement, is designed to further confirm real targets and eliminate false targets.

"trans-boundary air pollution in a southeast asian megacity: case studies of the synoptic meteorological mechanisms and impacts on air quality","2022","Local and regional sources contribute to degraded air quality in many urban areas, however, the influence of trans-boundary air pollution on surface PM2.5 is still poorly characterized in Southeast Asia (SEA) megacities. This study, for the first time, utilizes multi-platform datasets to elucidate two trans-boundary PM2.5 episodes in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, over the periods 25–29 Oct 2013 and 05–08 Oct 2015. Both events persisted with limited diurnal fluctuations and more than 60% of the Air Quality Index (AQI) values at an unhealthy level. PM2.5 concentrations during the events were 100% and 115% higher on average compared to local accumulation periods in the same months, highlighting the importance of trans-boundary pollution to local HCMC air quality. Backward trajectories, MERRA-2 AOD data, and CALIPSO images revealed the origin and synoptic meteorology conditions facilitating both trans-boundary pollution events. Anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions in continental East Asia fed the 2013 event, which was then transported by strong northeasterly winds triggered by an upper-level ridge near the Tibetan Plateau and a low-pressure system in western Pacific Ocean. In contrast, the 2015 event was the result of Indonesia biomass burning (BB), which was enhanced and transported by a westward propagating Western Pacific Subtropical High triggered by a strong El Niño event. Future climate change will likely increase the number of extreme El Niño events, leading to the increase of transboundary Indonesia BB events to HCMC.

"energy-efficient cyclical trajectory design for uav-aided maritime data collection in wind","2020","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially fixed-wing ones that withstand strong winds, have great potential for oceanic exploration and research. This paper studies a UAVaided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV's energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory subject to wind effect, which is a non-convex problem and difficult to solve optimally. Existing techniques such as the successive convex approximation (SCA) method provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on the trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered the wind effect, while the computational complexity and resulted trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently subject to wind effect. Specifically, the proposed UAV trajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible for collecting only a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the computational/trajectory complexity, which allows searching for better trajectory initialization that fits the buoys' topology and the wind. Numerical results show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the benchmark oneflight-only scheme in general.

"the paleoposition of india","1986","In most of the plate tectonic models of paleocontinental assembly, the supercontinent Pangea has been disassociated into independent Laurasia and Gondwana, separated by a vast oceanic Tethys. The position of India remains problematical, but geological and geophysical data support a Pangea reconstruction. Traditionally India has always been regarded as a part of Gondwana as it shares two unique geologic features with other southern continents. These are the Upper Paleozoic glacial strata and the Glossopteris flora. However, neither line of evidence definitely proves continuity of land; together they indicate zonation of cold climates. The recent discovery of Upper Paleozoic glacial strata in the U.S.S.R., southern Tibet, Saudi Arabia, Oman, China, Malaya, Thailand, and Burma demonstrates that the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation was far more extensive beyond the Gondwana limit than is usually thought. Similarly the Glossopteris flora has been found farther north of the Indian Peninsula, in the Himalaya, Kashmir and Tibet. Moreover the floral similarities are explained easily by wind and insect dispersal. On the other hand, the distribution of large terrestrial tetrapods is strongly influenced by the distribution of continents. To terrestrial tetrapods, sea constitutes a barrier. In consequence, they are more reliable indicators of past land connections than are plants, invertebrates and fishes. The postulated separation of India from Antarctica, its northward journey, and its subsequent union with Asia, as suggested by the plate tectonic models, require that during some part of the Mesozoic or Early Tertiary India must have been an island continent. The lack of endemism in the Indian terrestrial tetrapods during this period is clearly inconsistent with the island continent hypothesis. On the contrary, Indian Mesozoic and Tertiary vertebrates show closest similarities to those of Laurasia, indicating that India was never far from Asia. The correlation of faunal similarity is extremly poor between India-Antarctica and India-Australia. This suggests that India cannot be placed alongside Antarctica or Australia in a pre-drift assembly. Moreover, the distribution of marine rocks indicates that India faced an open sea at its eastern margin during Proterozoic, Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Before the drift, India probably occupied the position between Somalia and Asia, and the Tethys was narrow and intracontinental. With the spreading of the Carlsberg Ridge in the Upper Cretaceous, the Indian block rotated counter-clockwise in relation to Africa to converge to Asia, with the opening up of the Arabian Sea. The rotational movement of India is supported by hot spot trajectory and reversal of paleoslopes of the ancient Gondwana rivers. There is a possible genetic relation between the Arabian sphenochasm and the origin of the Himalaya. With continued convergence of India to Asia, limited subduction occured at the Indus Suture along the axis of the Tethys; the further compression led to the closure of the Tethys followed by foldings, faultings and large-scale intracratonic subductions to form the Himalaya. The Himalayan uplift probably began in the Miocene, but went more actively in the Quaternary.",""

"an unsupervised learning method with convolutional auto-encoder for vessel trajectory similarity computation","2021","To achieve reliable mining results for massive vessel trajectories, one of the most important challenges is how to efficiently compute the similarities between different vessel trajectories. The computation of vessel trajectory similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based methods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory similarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be guaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation results.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Convolutional auto-encoder (CAE),Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory clustering,Trajectory similarity,"
"unmanned-surface-vehicle-aided maritime data collection using deep reinforcement learning","2022","Employing unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as marine data collectors is promising for large-scale environment sensing in remote ocean monitoring network. In this article, we consider a USV-aided marine data collection network, where a USV collects data from multiple monitoring terminals while avoiding collisions with monitoring terminals and obstacles. Aiming at minimizing energy consumption and data loss, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem with practical constraints, including collision avoidance, steering angle, and velocity limitation. The problem is intractable due to the stochastic arrived data and the random emergence and movement of dynamic obstacles.

"maritime traffic route detection framework based on statistical density analysis from ais data using a clustering algorithm","2022","Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorffâ€“distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.","traffic separation scheme,ocean areas,marine accidents,Clustering algorithms,Safety,targeted ocean area,Douglas-Peucker algorithm,automatic identification system data,vehicle routing,total maritime traffic,Marine vehicles,maritime autonomous surface ships,quantitative traffic routes,geographic characteristics,DBSCAN,statistical analysis,ships,marine safety,kernel density estimation,AIS trajectory simple,maritime traffic route detection framework,kernel density estimation analysis,Oceans,Hausdorff-distance algorithm,ship trajectory pattern,framework,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,statistical density analysis,marine engineering computing,Trajectory,ship characteristics,maritime traffic route research,Navigation,safety route,density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise,clustering algorithm,AIS data,maritime traffic route,"

First, AIS data is preprocessed and trajectory reconstructed to restore the ship historical navigation state, and a ship encounter identification model is constructed according to the encounter characteristics; Second, a two-stage collision avoidance behavior extraction algorithm is formed to build a behavior knowledge base, and the scenario similarity model is constructed to measure and match similar scenarios based on ship position, motion tendency and collision risk. Then, the Delaunay Triangulation Network is used to fuse ship trajectories of similar scenario to form the collision avoidance path. Finally, a case study is performed using the real AIS data outside Ningbo-Zhoushan Port waters, China, and the effectiveness of the planned path is verified by setting the head-on and crossing situations and comparison between the planned and real paths.

"rainwater chemical composition at two sites in central mexico","2006","Chemical analyses were performed on rainwater samples collected at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City and at a wooded site, Rancho Viejo (RV) in the State of Mexico, for the periods 1994–2000 and 1994–1999, respectively. At UNAM, rainwater was collected for the entire rainy season period each year, while at RV, technical considerations limited collection to weekends only. The results showed large variations in rainwater chemical composition in most years, mainly because of the variability of meteorological conditions and also because of changes in source emissions. Sulfates and NH4+ showed higher annual volume-weighted mean concentrations (VWMC) in both sites. At UNAM, the maximum annual VWMC for SO42− occurred in March and the minimum in July and August. Lower concentrations of almost all ions were found at RV; however, the H+ concentration was higher at this site. The pH in Mexico City, calculated from the annual VWMC of H+, was 4.95, which is a little higher than pH values reported in some other countries. Despite the fact that sulfate and NO3− concentrations were lower at RV, the pH was lower. Air-mass back trajectories were calculated for individual concentrations of SO42−, H+, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, observed at each sampling site for weekend data. At RV, sulfate concentrations were higher when air-mass back trajectories indicated a wind flow from Mexico City and Toluca at 1000 MAGL (meters above ground level) and 3000 MAGL. The hydrogen ion exhibited the same behavior. Calcium and Mg2+ concentrations were also higher when the wind blew from urban areas at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. At UNAM, H+ concentration was lower and Ca2+ and Mg2+ were higher when wind blew from the northern sector of the city at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. In UNAM, the NO3−/SO42− and NH4+/SO42− ratios were 0.5 and 1.09 in 1994 and 0.86 and 1.64 in 2000, respectively, indicating a decrease in SO2 emissions resulting from the change of fuel oil to gas fuel. The SO42−/Ca2+ ratio was significantly lower at the UNAM site (1.82) compared to RV (5.36), and the SO42−/H+ ratio was significantly higher at the UNAM site (6.77) compared to RV (2.01). The Spearman's rho correlation between ionic concentrations indicated a positive correlation in most cases (p<0.05) for data from UNAM and RV. The multiple regression correlation analysis to predict H+ concentration in Mexico City showed that NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, and Ca2+ contributed 23.2%, 20.9%, 8.0%, and 6.1%, respectively, to the H+ prediction, while Cl− plus Na+ plus K+ only contributed 2.2%, and Mg2+ did not contribute. Sea-salt contribution to rainwater chemical composition was negligible with any wind direction at both levels. Excess sulfate (non-sea-salt sulfate) represented 98.7% of the total sulfate in rainwater collected during weekends at RV and 98.6% for weekend and annual rain samples at UNAM.","Central Mexico,Acidity in forests,Annual variations,Rainwater chemistry,"

"a sequential random forest for short-term vessel speed prediction","2022","Short-term vessel speed prediction is exceedingly crucial to various issues in maritime transport, notably in cases with high precision requirement, such as trajectory tracking and collision avoidance. The methods for speed prediction have successively experienced the evolution of empirical formulas, physics-based approaches and data-driven models. Compared to the other two pioneering methods, building the model from data-driven learning seems to be a more appropriate way for ever-larger vessels that entered service in recent years. However, owing to insufficient speed-related features that can be known in advance, such as the engine state and propeller propulsion, traditional data-driven models usually have poor generalization ability when facing new test data. In this paper, taking a case study of a 400,000 DWT ore carrier sailing between China and Brazil, we first provide comparisons of several widely-used data-driven models and select the framework of random forest as the basic. Then, by considering the hardship of directly utilizing real-time monitoring data, we creatively put forward a novel prediction model by introducing sequential data of last historical speed records to bring the potential information of engine state into model learning. Through comprehensive experiments, the superiority and robustness of the proposed model are demonstrated by comparing with other frequently-used time-series prediction methods.","Random forest,Short-term vessel speed prediction,Temporal data,Data-driven methods,Very large ore carriers,"

"deep learning-powered vessel trajectory prediction for improving smart traffic services in maritime internet of things","2022","The maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a revolutionary communication paradigm where a large number of moving vessels are closely interconnected in intelligent maritime networks. However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identification system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efficacy. To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories.

This study aims to develop a novel unsupervised methodology for feature extraction and knowledge discovery based on automatic identification system (AIS) data, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support trajectory data mining. The unsupervised hierarchical methodology is constructed from three parts: trajectory compression, trajectory similarity measure, and trajectory clustering. In the first part, an adaptive Douglas–Peucker with speed (ADPS) algorithm is created to preserve critical features, obtain useful information, and simplify trajectory information. Then, dynamic time warping (DTW) is utilized to measure the similarity between trajectories as the critical indicator in trajectory clustering. Finally, the improved spectral clustering with mapping (ISCM) is presented to extract vessel traffic behavior characteristics and mine movement patterns for enhancing marine safety and situational awareness. Comprehensive experiments are conducted and implemented in the Chengshan Jiao Promontory in China to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel methodology. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can effectively compress the trajectories, determine the number of clusters in advance, guarantee the clustering accuracy, and extract useful navigation knowledge while significantly reducing the computational cost. The clustering results are further explored and follow the Gaussian mixture distribution, which can help provide new discriminant criteria for trajectory clustering.","Trajectory compression,Pattern extraction,Maritime traffic safety management,Knowledge discovery,Trajectory clustering,"
"a data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","2023","Maritime traffic network is essential for navigation efficiency and safety of the maritime transport system. This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","Maritime traffic network,Maritime transport management,AIS,Machine learning,Big data analytics,"
"anomaly detection in maritime data based on geometrical analysis of trajectories","2015","Anomaly detection is an important use of the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), because it offers support to users to evaluate if a vessel is in trouble or causing trouble. For instance, it can be used to detect if a ship is doing something that may cause an accident or if it has changed its route to avoid bad weather condition. In this work, a new method for finding anomalies in the ships' movements is proposed. The method analyzes the trajectory of ships from a geometrical perspective. The trajectory of the ship is compared with a near-optimal path that is generated by a graph search algorithm. The proposed method extracts some scale-invariant features from the real trajectory and also from the optimal movement pattern, and it compares the two sets of features to generate an abnormality score. The method is unsupervised and it does not require training. Instead of labeling the trajectories as normal/abnormal it calculates a score value that denotes the extent of abnormality. The scoring scheme provides a ranking system in which the user can sort the trajectories based on their abnormality score. This is useful when dealing with large number of trajectories and the user wants to picks the most abnormal cases. For the evaluation, the method was run on three months data of North Pacific Ocean and score values were generated. Among the entire dataset, 100 randomly chosen trajectories were labeled by an expert. After applying a threshold on the score value, the proposed method had 94% accuracy.","maritime data,Clustering algorithms,randomly chosen trajectories,optimal movement pattern,anomaly detection,North Pacific Ocean,Marine vehicles,abnormality score,Mathematical model,Feature extraction,geometrical trajectories analysis,scale-invariant features,ships,marine engineering,bad weather condition,AIS,Oceans,near-optimal path,ship trajectory,ship movements,graph theory,graph search algorithm,Joining processes,score values,search problems,Trajectory,automatic identification systems,"

"footprints of fishing vessels in chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","2022","The importance and difficulty of large-scale quantitative analysis of fishing vessel footprints and fishing intensities with high resolution have received more and more attention and recognition in fishery research. In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated. It is found that the footprints of fishing vessels in China's EEZ waters have a positive spatial correlation, and the areas with high fishing intensities are clustered in the coastal waters of Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and Guangdong Province.

Hence it is critical that we develop unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms that both operate on a data stream and adapt to it. Real-world maritime data streams involve multiple, intersecting forms of concept drift, meaning that the underlying data distribution changes over time. We introduce DB-Drift, a novel algorithm for adapting existing density-based unsupervised anomaly detection pipelines to handle gradual and seasonal drift simultaneously.","Pipelines,surveillance,DB-Drift,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection,unsupervised learning,Concept drift,data distribution,maritime trajectories,density-based unsupervised anomaly detection,Signal processing,concept drift aware density-based anomaly detection,Soft sensors,marine engineering computing,maritime surveillance operations,Trajectory,Surveillance,Signal processing algorithms,real-world maritime data streams,data handling,"
"hybrid satellite-uav-terrestrial networks for 6g ubiquitous coverage: a maritime communications perspective","2021","In the coming smart ocean era, reliable and efficient communications are crucial for promoting a variety of maritime activities. Current maritime communication networks (MCNs) mainly rely on marine satellites and on-shore base stations (BSs). The former generally provides limited transmission rate, while the latter lacks wide-area coverage capability. Due to these facts, the state-of-the-art MCN falls far behind terrestrial fifth-generation (5G) networks. To fill up the gap in the coming sixth-generation (6G) era, we explore the benefit of deployable BSs for maritime coverage enhancement. Both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile vessels are used to configure deployable BSs. This leads to a hierarchical satellite-UAV-terrestrial network on the ocean. We address the joint link scheduling and rate adaptation problem for this hybrid network, to minimize the total energy consumption with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Different from previous studies, we use only the large-scale channel state information (CSI), which is location-dependent and thus can be predicted through the position information of each UAV/vessel based on its specific trajectory/shipping lane. The problem is shown to be an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with a group of hidden non-linear equality constraints. We solve it suboptimally by using Min-Max transformation and iterative problem relaxation, leading to a process-oriented joint link scheduling and rate adaptation scheme. As observed by simulations, the scheme can provide agile on-demand coverage for all users with much reduced system overhead and a polynomial computation complexity. Moreover, it can achieve a prominent performance close to the optimal solution.","Satellites,unmanned aerial vehicles,fifth-generation networks,maritime communications perspective,NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem,polynomial computation complexity,nonlinear equality constraints,on-shore base stations,quality of service,optimal control,wide-area coverage capability,current maritime communication networks,maritime coverage enhancement,integer programming,Resource management,MCN,link scheduling,iterative problem relaxation,scheduling,agile on-demand coverage,trajectory-shipping lane,Channel state information (CSI),reliable communications,process-oriented joint link scheduling,large-scale channel state information,Quality of service,Maritime communications,marine satellites,rate adaptation,sixth-generation era,efficient communications,hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks,rate adaptation problem,6G mobile communication,radio networks,software prototyping,wireless channels,smart ocean era,iterative methods,autonomous aerial vehicles,deployable BSs,6G ubiquitous coverage,Optimization,nonlinear programming,min-max transformation,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Trajectory,energy consumption,trajectory control,computational complexity,marine communication,optimal solution,mobile vessels,transmission rate,maritime communications,unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),hybrid network,"
"context learning from a ship trajectory cluster for anomaly detection","2023","This paper presents a context information extraction process over Automatic Identification System (AIS) real-world ship data, building a system with the capability to extract representative points of a trajectory cluster. With the trajectory cluster, the study proposes the use of trajectory segmentation algorithms to extract representative points of each trajectory and then use the k-means algorithm to obtain a series of centroids over all the representative points. These centroids, combined, form a new representative trajectory of the cluster. This new representative trajectory of the input cluster represents new contextual information extracted from the original set of trajectories, being possible to apply anomaly detection approaches over the new obtained context. The results show a suitable approach with several compression algorithms that are compared with a metric based on the Perpendicular Euclidean Distance.","Trajectory compression,Data mining,AIS data,Trajectory clustering,Context learning,"

"automatic ship route design between two ports: a data-driven method","2020","With the forced installation of the ship's automatic identification system (AIS), a large amount of ship trajectory data in the world is generated. These data provide information on latitude, longitude, speed and course, and plenty of materials for maritime pattern extraction and vessel behavior prediction. And how to dig into these AIS data deeply to discover the ship behavior pattern is an important job. There are two key points on the automatic ship route design research: the turning area generation and the turning area linkage. In this paper, we integrate DBSCAN and Artificial Neural Network capable of automatic ship route design based on massive AIS data between certain ports. The main purpose of this study is to recognize the key regions by applying DBSCAN algorithm and then connect these regions automatically by cluster similarity measuring. Then artificial neural network has been used to learn the relationship of turning regions and generate a reasonable route with different ship dimensions. The main achievement of this study have twofold. First, a research framework for automatic generation of ship route is proposed. We can process big AIS data and use them to generate ship route. Second, generation of different routes according to ships of different dimension under the research framework. The method is capable of generating ship route automatically according to different ship dimensions, which has been evaluated on two real routes around the world.","DBSCAN algorithm,Data-driven,Ship dimensions,Ship route design,ANN,"
"ship trajectory uncertainty prediction based on a gaussian process model","2019","The uncertainty of ship trajectory prediction is addressed. In particular, a probabilistic trajectory prediction model is proposed that describes the uncertainty in future positions along the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions. The ship motion prediction is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal directions, and position probabilities are calculated along these two directions. A data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model based on a Gaussian Process is proposed to describe the lateral motion uncertainty, while the longitudinal uncertainty results from the uncertainty on the ship acceleration along the route. The parameters of the probabilistic models are derived off-line based on historic trajectory information provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The model is then applied to predict the trajectory uncertainty in real time by iteratively updating the prior probability models based on new observed AIS data. Moreover, a sequential Cholesky decomposition algorithm is applied in this study to reduce the computational effort required by the Gaussian Process modelling. Three months of AIS data are used to train and test the proposed probabilistic trajectory prediction model. The results obtained show that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy and meets the demands of real-time applications.","Uncertainty modelling,AIS data,Gaussian process,Trajectory prediction,"

"uav-assisted maritime legitimate surveillance: joint trajectory design and power allocation","2023","This paper investigates a novel maritime wireless surveillance scenario, where a legitimate monitor vessel moves around to eavesdrop the suspicious communication from a suspicious unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to a suspicious vessel with the help of a cooperative UAV. Specifically, the cooperative UAV can adjust its jamming power and trajectory to exactly control the transmission rate of the suspicious link, thus improving the monitor vessel's surveillance performance. Furthermore, since the cooperative UAV cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, its jamming power allocation on the ocean should be carefully designed by the energy thresholds. Under such setup, we formulate a sum eavesdropping rate maximization problem, which jointly optimizes the jamming power and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the cooperative UAV, as well as the two-dimensional (2D) trajectory of the monitor vessel. To address this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the design problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm to find its suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed jamming-assisted 3D joint design can significantly improve the eavesdropping rate and save the jamming power compared to the benchmark schemes.","Trajectory,Wireless communication,UAV cooperative jamming,trajectory design,Eavesdropping,Surveillance,Autonomous aerial vehicles,Three-dimensional displays,power allocation,Maritime legitimate surveillance,Jamming,"

However, the traditional methods cannot be used to distinguish the trajectories in opposite directions. This paper presents an improved measurement with Cosine and Hausdorff distance to measure the difference between any two trajectories in different directions.

"graph signal variation detection: a novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship ais tangled trajectories","2023","Tangles are a common anomaly in Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, resulting from disorder in time sequences. They increase the spatial complexity of trajectories, making existing methods unable to fully recognize and process them. This will seriously affect the analysis of ship behavior. Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","Total variation,Trajectory preprocessing,Graph signal,AIS data,Greedy algorithm,"
"a context-aware approach for vessels’ trajectory prediction","2023","An accurate vessel trajectory prediction can improve safety management at sea. Although the vessels' trajectories can be affected by complex and high dimensional context factors such as wind, wave size, and current, the research in incorporating them in trajectory prediction is still burgeoning. This paper proposes a context-aware data-driven framework for vessel trajectory prediction. In this regard, trajectories are enriched with context information at the first stage. This includes evaluating methods of trajectory annotation. Next, feature selection techniques are applied to solve the problems caused by high dimensionality, i.e., incensement in the complexity and the computational load. Finally, selected factors are used in a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network. The implementations on the Automatic Identification System (AIS), weather, and ocean condition dataset around the English Channel collected during February 2016, indicated that the spline interpolation is suitable for trajectory annotation. Water depth, wave direction, and height are the most influencing context in vessels’ data-driven movement prediction. The predictions made by the proposed framework are 15.31% more accurate than the prediction of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Therefore, the proposed context-aware trajectory prediction framework might suit maritime systems and applications like collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection.",""
"cae: contextual auto-encoder for multivariate time-series anomaly detection in air transportation","2022","The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast protocol is one of the latest compulsory advances in air surveillance. While it supports the tracking of the ever-growing number of aircraft in the air, it also introduces cybersecurity issues that must be mitigated e.g., false data injection attacks where an attacker emits fake surveillance information. The recent data sources and tools available to obtain flight tracking records allow the researchers to create datasets and develop Machine Learning models capable of detecting such anomalies in En-Route trajectories. In this context, we propose a novel multivariate anomaly detection model called Contextual Auto-Encoder (CAE). It uses the baseline of a regular LSTM-based auto-encoder but with several decoders, each getting data of a specific flight phase (e.g. climbing, cruising or descending) during its training. To illustrate the CAE’s efficiency, an evaluation dataset was created using real-life anomalies as well as realistically crafted trajectory modifications, with which the CAE as well as three anomaly detection models from the literature were evaluated. Results show that the CAE achieves better results in both accuracy and speed of detection. The dataset, the models implementations and the evaluation results are available in an online repository, thereby enabling replicability and facilitating future experiments.","Air traffic security,Anomaly detection,Multivariate time series,CAE,ADS-B,"
"data mining approach to shipping route characterization and anomaly detection based on ais data","2020","A data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection. The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines. Finally, an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided.","Traffic characterization,Maritime traffic,Anomaly detection,Data mining,AIS data,"

The minisatellite has been modified to accommodate a propulsion system capable of delivering up to 1700 m/s delta-V, enabling it to support a wide range of very low cost missions to LaGrange points, Near-Earth Objects, and the Moon. A mission to the Moon - dubbed “MoonShine” - is proposed as the first demonstration of the modified minisatellite beyond LEO. The second platform - Surrey's Interplanetary Platform - has been designed to support missions with delta-V requirements up to 3200 m/s, making it ideal for low cost missions to Mars and Venus, as well as Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and other interplanetary trajectories. Analysis has proved mission feasibility, identifying key challenges in both missions for developing cost-effective techniques for: spacecraft propulsion; navigation; autonomous operations; and a reliable safe mode strategy.

"long-term impact of continental and maritime airflow on aerosol environment and rain microstructure near landâ€“sea boundary","2022","The present study deals with the interplay of multiple atmospheric processes in changing the microphysical properties of precipitation during the pre-monsoon season (Marchâ€“May) using the long-term experimental data of raindrop size distributions (DSDs) spanning over 15 years (2005â€“2019) obtained at an urban tropical location, Kolkata (22.57Â°N, 88.37Â°E), near the landâ€“sea boundary. The changing pattern of air mass flows from the maritime and continental region, which contribute to the formation of precipitation processes, has been responsible for the varying characteristics of rain. Changes in raindrop sizes are related to aerosol properties, cloud features, temperature, and relative humidity that change mass-weighted mean drop diameter ( $D_{m}$ ) differently in low and high rain rate regimes.  $D_{m}$  has shown an increasing trend over time for low rain rates (< 15 mm/h), but a decreasing trend for high rain rate regimes (â‰¥15 mm/h). An increase (decrease) in mean temperature (relative humidity) below the atmospheric boundary layer (< 1.6 km) has enhanced the evaporation of small raindrops and altered rain microphysical features. Based on satellite observations, it has been found that the increasing aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been accompanied by an increase in cloud effective radius (CER), resulting in the anti-Twomey effect, which is due to the dominance of maritime influence over continental activities. Because of the predominant maritime activities, sea salt aerosols have a greater presence, causing an increase in CER, which consequently prevents raindrops from becoming large enough before they fall, thereby reducing  $D_{m}$  at high rainfall rates.","sea salt aerosols,clouds,continental region,rain,altered rain microphysical features,temperature,cloud features,rain drop sizes,atmospheric optics,atmospheric boundary layer,Clouds,pre-monsoon season,continental activities,maritime airflow,change mass-weighted mean drop diameter,air mass,precipitation dynamics,aerosol properties,precipitation process,aerosol environment,raindrops,predominant maritime activities,rain microstructure,raindrop size distributions,high rainfall rates,Aerosols,atmospheric humidity,mean temperature,urban tropical location,raindrop sizes,maritime/continental airflow,maritime influence,low rain rates,high rain rate regimes,MODIS,Trajectory,aerosol optical depth,cloud effective radius,Ocean temperature,anthropogenic activities,Rain,changing pattern,Market research,monsoons,land-sea boundary,multiple atmospheric process,relative humidity,aerosols,atmospheric temperature,atmospheric techniques,"

Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N2O5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding the low level of SO2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant emissions SW of Milan, beyond the Apennines. A distinctive pattern for HCl was observed, featured by an afternoon peak and a morning minimum, and best correlated to atmospheric temperature, although it was not possible to identify any specific source.

"a semi-supervised deep learning model for ship encounter situation classification","2021","Maritime safety is an important issue for global shipping industries. Currently, most of collision accidents at sea are caused by the misjudgement of the ship’s operators. The deployment of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) can greatly reduce ships’ reliance on human operators by using an automated intelligent collision avoidance system to replace human decision-making. To successfully develop such a system, the capability of autonomously identifying other ships and evaluating their associated encountering situation is of paramount importance. In this paper, we aim to identify ships’ encounter situation modes using deep learning methods based upon the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. First, a segmentation process is developed to divide each ship’s AIS data into different segments that contain only one encounter situation mode. This is different to the majority of studies that have proposed encounter situation mode classification using hand-crafted features, which may not reflect the actual ship’s movement states. Furthermore, a number of present classification tasks are conducted using substantial labelled AIS data followed by a supervised training paradigm, which is not applicable to our dataset as it contains a large number of unlabelled AIS data. Therefore, a method called Semi-Supervised Convolutional Encoder–Decoder Network (SCEDN) for ship encounter situation classification based on AIS data is proposed. The structure of the network is not only able to automatically extract features from AIS segments but also share training parameters for the unlabelled data. The SCEDN uses an encoder–decoder convolutional structure with four channels for each segment (distance, speed, Time to the Closed Point of Approach (TCPA) and Distance to the Closed Point of Approach (DCPA)) been developed. The performance of the SCEDN model are evaluated by comparing to several baselines with the experimental results demonstrating a higher accuracy can be achieved by our proposed model.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Trajectory data,Deep learning,Convolutional neural network,Semi-supervised learning,Encounter situation classification,Encoder–decoder,"
"verification and intercomparison of global ocean eulerian near-surface currents","2023","The OceanPredict task team for Intercomparison and Validation (IV-TT) has established the CLASS4 data standard for routine forecast verification against selected reference observing platforms. The set of CLASS4 reference data has been recently extended to include near-surface currents derived from the trajectories of drifting buoys drogued at 15 m. We have applied these data to the Ocean Model, Analysis and Prediction System (OceanMAPS) at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABoM) for verification and inter-comparison with Mercator Océan International ocean forecast system (MOi), the operational models of the Met Office, UK: Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) and Coupled Atmosphere-Land-Ocean-Ice Data Assimilation (CPLDA) systems, and the Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GDPS-GIOPS) at the Canadian Centre for Meteorological and Environmental Prediction (CCMEP). The aims for this verification analysis are to extend the routine monitoring of the operational system; to assess the OceanMAPS skill against other models; and to inform our stakeholders of the OceanMAPS performance. We have evaluated the impacts of adding Stokes drift and tidal currents from separate global wave and global tide models to the model currents on the verification of currents. Including Stokes drift leads to significant improvements in representation and the metrics for model skill while inclusion of tides has no significant impact on the global statistics. Zonal currents have a stronger signal than the meridional currents as indicated by their high correlation with observations, and lower errors. This indicates zonal currents on average are more predictable and persistent than the meridional currents, resulting in improved representation in the models. Overall, MOi, and the new version of OceanMAPS (4.0i), and FOAM show marginally better performance against the observations relative to other models. Although there are significant differences in the configurations of the eight models under evaluation, all the models are shown to be remarkably statistically equivalent with consistent spatial and temporal patterns indicating the main differences are attributable to unrepresented processes. We therefore conclude that there is significant scope to further improve the representation of the modelled currents with the observations.","Intercomparison of global ocean models,Global drifter program,Ocean modelling,Ocean currents verification,"

"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%. With the proposed computational framework, AIS data can be utilized for maritime predictions, supporting more complex marine applications and covering more expansive geographic areas.","Vessel trajectory prediction,Automatic Identification System,Vessel origin–destination analysis,Vessel destination prediction,"
"neural network-based automatic reconstruction of missing vessel trajectory data","2019","Automatic identification system (AIS) is an independent tracking system which has been widely utilized on ships to frequently broadcast the time-stamped vessel position reports. The generated massive AIS data can contribute to protecting maritime security and enhancing maritime transportation efficiency, such as maritime surveillance, anomaly detection and traffic route extraction, etc. However, the received AIS-based vessel trajectories commonly suffer from missing data due to network overload and bad weathers. To improve the quality of vessel trajectories for further researches, a two-step calculation method for vessel trajectory reconstruction is proposed in this work. In particular, the Random Forest method is introduced in the first step to automatically identify the missing position records within vessel trajectories. The missing data points could be accurately estimated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The second step proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories with missing AIS data.

"a visibility graph approach for path planning and real-time collision avoidance on maritime unmanned systems","2021","In high navigation traffic areas, path planning and collision avoidance is a crucial element of safe navigation, mostly in view of possible future applications in hybrid scenarios where both manned and Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) share the environment.This paper deals with a novel procedure to generate optimal paths in presence of static and moving obstacles. The proposed path planning approach deals with an optimization problem based on the so-called Essential Visibility Graph (EVG) [1], an extension of the standard Visibility Graph (VG) [2], in order to find the minimum cost piecewise linear path between two points in a scenario with several obstacles. Such approach can be used also in presence of multiple ASV or movable obstacles, by using a re-planning procedure to update the EVG over a selected prediction time interval. To make the solution compliant with the current regulation and make ASV behaviour predictable by human pilots on manned vehicles, EVG was extended by implementing a cut procedure based on Collision Regulations (COLREGS) [3]. Finally, the use of Dubins curves provides smooth paths, compliant with physics constraints such as the minimum turn radius.A campaign of numerical simulations was carried out to test the effectiveness of the proposed technique in different operational scenarios. Results show that the algorithm is always able to identify COLREGS-compliant trajectories, in order to avoid collisions and assure minimum safety distance as well.

"mining regular behaviors based on multidimensional trajectories","2016","In the information fusion domain, mining regular behaviors is very important to task classification, anomaly behavior detection, situation assessment and threat estimation. Through clustering multidimensional trajectories which are accumulated in all kinds of electronic information systems, regular behaviors could be mined. Most of the trajectories clustering methods are clustering spatial position closed trajectories to a cluster. They cannot distinguish behaviors whose space position is similar but the moving speed and direction are quite different. Some sub-trajectory clustering methods which presented similarity measures considering segment direction, speed, and angle could solve this problem, but they are not suitable to some application scenarios which should clustering the whole trajectories. In this paper, we proposed a multidimensional trajectory clustering algorithm to mine regular behaviors by considering the attribute, type, position, velocity and course characteristics, and implement it on two experiments. This research is very helpful for mining all the regular behaviors in different application scenarios and would have a wide prospect in expert and intelligent systems.","Hausdorff distance,Multidimensional trajectory,Clustering,Regular behavior,"
"spatial clustering method of historical ais data for maritime traffic routes extraction","2022","The automated extraction of maritime routes that accurately resembles the real traffic of vessels is crucial for intelligent traffic management systems to understand vessel behaviour in sea areas, identify events, and support decision-making. Available solutions for maritime traffic route extraction utilize traditional clustering algorithms, which have high computational costs. Data reduction methods are proposed for use with these clustering methods to improve clustering performance, which involves a loss in movement pattern quality. Such solutions often result in low quality representations of traffic routes, which poorly estimate sailing distances for long journeys and time of arrivals and poorly identify non-conformities. In this paper, we propose a spatial clustering method (SPTCLUST-II) to extract spatial representations of sailing routes from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Our method can cluster huge volumes of trajectory data in a minimal amount of time without using any of the traditional clustering algorithms and with no reduction or modification of the spatio-temporal predicates of the original trajectories. A real-world AIS dataset captured in the area of the Gulf of Mexico is used for the evaluation of the proposed method.

"ship behavior prediction via trajectory extraction-based clustering for maritime situation awareness","2022","This study presents a method in which historical AIS data are used to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. This is facilitated via a system intelligence-based approach that can be subsequently utilized to provide enhanced situation awareness to navigators and future autonomous ships, aiding proactive collision avoidance. By evaluating the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region, the method applies machine learning techniques to extrapolate commonalities in relevant trajectory segments. These commonalities represent historical behavior modes that correspond to the possible future behavior of the selected vessel. Subsequently, the selected vessel is classified to a behavior mode, and a trajectory with respect to this mode is predicted. This is achieved via an initial clustering technique and subsequent trajectory extraction. The extracted trajectories are then compressed using the Karhunen–Loéve transform, and clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach in this study differs from others in that trajectories are not clustered for an entire region, but rather for relevant trajectory segments. As such, the extracted trajectories provide a much better basis for clustering relevant historical ship behavior modes. A selected vessel is then classified to one of these modes using its observed behavior. Trajectory predictions are facilitated using an enhanced subset of data that likely correspond to the future behavior of the selected vessel. The method yields promising results, with high classification accuracy and low prediction error. However, vessels with abnormal behavior degrade the results in some situations, and have also been discussed in this study.","Collision avoidance,Unsupervised learning,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"

"mobility pattern analysis of ship trajectories based on semantic transformation and topic model","2020","Recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications, i.e. route discovery and anomaly detection. Besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory, topic modeling popular in the field of Natural Language Processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents. This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","Ship mobility pattern,Trajectory analysis,Topic modeling,Automatic identification system,"

"ais-based maritime anomaly traffic detection: a review","2023","Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade. Due to the huge number of vessels worldwide, there is also a non-negligible volume of Maritime incidents such as collisions/sinking and illegal events (e.g., piracy, smuggling, and unauthorized fishing).

AIS provides one of the fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels’ traffic behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data. These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions.

"a prototype gui for unmanned air vehicle mission planning and execution","2014","This paper describes the development of a graphical user interface which provides unique mission control services to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators. The software has two modes of operation, Planning Mode and Execution Mode. In Planning Mode an operator can readily simulate a desired flight plan to determine mission feasibility. Key features of this mode include integration of forecast weather data and interactive trajectory planning. Harsh North Atlantic weather can jeopardize a mission, so running a simulation with predicted wind conditions may greatly reduce the risk of a UAV loss. In Execution Mode the operator can deploy an autonomous vehicle, change the route “on the fly”, hold the aircraft over a point of interest, and return the UAV to home base whenever necessary. In both modes the predicted and actual weather conditions are the key to mission success. All weather data required for these functions is automatically downloaded via the internet. Operation of the software, including interactive trajectory planning, weather observation, mission planning and execution, is achieved through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Simulation results, flight trajectories, and weather data can be saved for further analysis. Comparing missions with and without weather information, it was determined that meteorological information can have a very significant impact on the mission success or failure.

However, AIS can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or â€œspoofingâ€.

Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations.

"improved kinematic interpolation for ais trajectory reconstruction","2021","Ship trajectory information has made a significant contribution to the data-based research in analyzing maritime transportation and has facilitated the improvement of maritime safety. However, the AIS data, which consists of ship trajectory, inevitably contains noises or missing data that can interfere with the conclusion. In this paper, an improved kinematic interpolation is presented for AIS trajectory reconstruction, which integrates data preprocessing and interpolation that considers the ships' kinematic information. The improved kinematic reconstruction method includes four steps: (1) data preprocessing, (2) analysis of time interval distribution, (3) abnormal data detection and removal, (4) kinematic interpolation that takes the kinematic feature of ships (i.e., velocity and acceleration) into account, adding forward and backward track points to help correct the acceleration function of reconstruction points.

"discovering maritime traffic route from ais network","2016","The recent build-up network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipped on vessels provides a rich source of vessel movement information. AIS is originally designed for automatically exchanging navigation information, such as their unique identification, position, course, and speed, with nearby vessels and terrestrial receivers to affect collision avoidance and safety control. The collected sequences of AIS logs can be considered as maritime trajectory data, i.e., the sequences of location points with timestamps. This vast amount of AIS trajectory data can be collected and employed to achieve an awareness of maritime traffic knowledge. This paper is devoted to discovery of maritime traffic route from trajectory data generated by AIS networks. However, AIS trajectory data discovery is a challenging task because of the trajectory data is available with uncertainty. Furthermore, unlike the vehicles' movements are constrained by road networks, there is no such a sea route for vessels to follow in marine areas. To overcome the challenges, we propose a framework of Maritime Traffic Route Discovery (abbreviated as MTRD) to generate pattern-aware routes to achieve an effective understanding of maritime traffic awareness.

"a deep encoder-decoder network for anomaly detection in driving trajectory behavior under spatio-temporal context","2022","Traditional trajectory anomaly detection aims to find abnormal trajectory points or sequences using data mining techniques. As a comparison, we focus on the evaluation of the anomalies of driving habits for different drivers based on their trajectory data. This is particularly important for the application of adjusting the amount of insurance in accordance with the driving behaviors. Instead of customizing rules for modeling various driving behaviors, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for driving trajectory anomaly detection, called STDTB-AD. Specifically, taking into account the fact that movement is spatial–temporal dependent, the study first partitions the whole road network into a series of spatial–temporal units, which have homogeneous properties of traffic flows. Then, the motion parameters (i.e., acceleration, speed, and direction) of driving trajectories falling within each spatio-temporal unit are calculated for representing context-aware features of drivers. This method is able to detect the deviation of movement from the normal traffic state on the spatial–temporal units. Finally, a variational autoencoder is utilized to quantify the abnormity degree of each driver according to the reconstruction probability of driving feature vector. Evaluations based on taxi trajectory data show that our model can consider both the spatial and temporal contexts for detecting driving behavior anomalies and achieve higher detection accuracy than traditional models based on either spatial or temporal context.","Anomaly detection,Driving behavior,Deep learning,Trajectory data,"

In this paper, we show how three division distances with the clusters can detect anomalous navigational behaviors. The proposed method decides for each trajectory point if the vessel is anomalous, considering longitude, latitude, speed and direction. Although the approach is point-based, which is applicable for real-time AIS surveillance, it is also flexible enough for analysts to set their own threshold for labeling whole trajectories.","naval engineering computing,navigational behaviors,Clustering algorithms,vessel movements,distance measurement,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,specialized distance measures,traffic separation scheme boundaries,Gravity,ship movement anomaly detection,ships,automatic identification system,real-time systems,maritime surveillance,Data models,international maritime organization rules,pattern clustering,trajectory mining,vessels,Trajectory,clustering,Labeling,real-time AIS surveillance,Data mining,maritime traffic domain,"

"deep learning to enhance maritime situation awareness","2019","Maritime surveillance sensors like AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Radar provide useful information for decision-making support, which is of paramount importance for effective operations against maritime threats and illegal activities [1]. However, decision-making systems that trust solely on AIS information tend to fail in real situations because such information could be missing, inaccurate or even deceptive [2]. On the other hand, only Radar information is not enough to get a complete description of the maritime situational picture. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for vessel monitoring that examines a particular scenario where a deep learning solution can infer a navigation status based on the vessels trajectories, and thus to detect suspicious vessels activities. For this purpose, a dataset, named DeepMarine, has been specifically created by collecting data of AIS historical recordings.

To gain the trust of the operator, it is important to develop a robust system, which gives the operator enough insight to take a rational choice about future steps.

Despite the goal of anomaly detection in real life operations, until today, mostly simulated anomalies have been evaluated to measure the performance of different algorithms. Therefore, an annotation tool is developed to provide a ground truth on a non-simulative dataset. The annotated data is used to compare different algorithms with each other.

Vessel motion dynamics are defined by multiple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with different long-run mean parameters, which in our approach can be estimated with a change detection procedure based on Page's test, aimed to reveal the spatial points representative of velocity changes. A density-based clustering algorithm is then applied to aggregate the detected changes into groups of similar elements and reject outliers.

"decade-low aerosol levels over the bohai and yellow seas amid the covid-19 lockdown","2022","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has crucially influenced anthropogenic activities, which in turn impacts upon the environment. In this study, we investigated the variations on aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm over the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea during the COVID-19 lockdown (from February to March in 2020) of China mainland based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observation by comparing with historical AOD records (2011–2019). Our results show that with the lockdown implementation, the decade-low AOD levels are achieved in February and March 2020 (0.39 ± 0.18 and 0.37 ± 0.19, respectively), which are 22% and 28% (p < 0.01) lower than the average AOD between 2011 and 2019 (0.50 ± 0.08 and 0.52 ± 0.05, respectively). After the lockdown restrictions were relaxed and industrial production gradually resumed, the AOD in April 2020 rebounded to the historical average level. Besides, compared with historical observations (2011–2019), the AOD temporal variability from February to April 2020 showed different pattern, with the decade-high increase from March to April (+0.11) and decade-low increase from February to March (-0.01). Independent observations and simulation, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from ground-based measurements, wind field from Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform, satellite-derived aerosol type, and back trajectories calculation by Hybird Single Paricle Lagrangian Intergrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, indicated that the above abnormal AOD variation can be attributed to reduction of anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The results of this paper, therefore, indicate that aerosols over the Bohai and Yellow Seas are strongly influenced by human activities, and the public health events such as the epidemic may alter the intensity of human activities and thus the spatio-temporal pattern of aerosol over ocean. With the global spread of the epidemic and the corresponding significant changes in human behavior patterns (restrictions on human activities, etc.), more studies should be carried out in the future about the aerosol variability and its potential impact on the marine environment.","PM,AOD,Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea,COVID-19,Decade-low,Lockdown,"

"a framework for maritime anti-collision pattern discovery from ais network","2019","The avoidance of collisions between ships in encounter situations is crucial to maritime traffic safety. Most research on maritime collision avoidance has focused on planning a safe path by which to avoid approaching ships in accordance with the requirements laid out in the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs). The resulting solution provides reference for the navigator in planning movements to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, specific anti-collision actions are generally based on the experience of the navigator. This study differed from existing works in that we sought to derive collision avoidance behavior from the trajectory data of actual ships. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) network makes it possible to collect an enormous volume of trajectory data and investigate real-world ship behavior. Unfortunately trajectory data that introduces uncertainty can hinder behavior mining for collision avoidance. Irregular and/or asynchronous location sampling can lead to situations in which the movement of a ship does not necessarily follow a given trajectory, even if its movement behavior is similar to that of other ships. In this study, we developed a framework to decipher the anti-collision behavior of ships in encounter situations from a large database of trajectory data collected by AIS network, and to present this behavior in the form of anti-collision patterns. A prototype of the proposed framework was built to enable pattern analysis and visualization functions, thereby providing a deeper understanding of collision avoidance behavior in maritime traffic.

"modeling and application of global maritime transport accessibility based on probability distribution","2023","The study of sea area accessibility is often overlooked despite the fact that vessel routesâ€™ density at sea can reflect human activity patterns.

An accessibility model for sea areas was then proposed and applied to the grid, resulting in the accessibility assessment of global sea areas in 2014 and 2018. The results indicated that the average global maritime accessibility value increased from 5.2% in 2014 to 14.4% in 2018. Accessibility to various international trade routes, such as those through the Cape of Good Hope and polar regions, significantly increased. However, accessibility to sea areas such as the Mediterranean and sea areas near the Pacific Islands decreased.

"changes in maritime traffic patterns according to installation of floating lidar using spatial analysis","2023","Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying.

In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.","Traffic control,Maritime traffic,maritime traffic data,buffer zone,Marine vehicles,wind power plants,globally maritime traffic patterns,Laser radar,marine space,existing maritime traffic patterns change,ships,marine safety,marine engineering,Wind farms,marine facilities,Oceans,regular traffic patterns,pattern clustering,Artificial intelligence,offshore installations,optical radar,future maritime traffic patterns,telecommunication traffic,spatial analysis,automatic identification system (AIS),Analytical models,"

"an adaptive threshold fast dbscan algorithm with preserved trajectory feature points for vessel trajectory clustering","2023","Vessel navigation pattern recognition plays an important role in the research of intelligent transportation on water. Clustering using the data stored in The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a current research hotspot. However, there are three problems in the past clustering analysis. First, the traditional Douglas-Peucker (DP) Compression Algorithm exists feature point loss and trajectory distortion when compressing trajectories. Second, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm require high time cost. Finally, most of the studies ignore the interaction between parameters when choosing the parameters of DBSCAN. These problems seriously affect the efficiency and accuracy of clustering. To solve these problems, this paper improves the existing methods by (1) Adaptive selection of compression thresholds and trajectory feature points for each trajectory when using the DP algorithm ensures the realism of the compressed trajectory; (2) using the Fast-DTW algorithm to improve the computation speed and ensure the accuracy of trajectory similarity; (3) Self-selection of parameter combinations based on Silhouette Coefficient (SC) scores was achieved using the similarity distribution of the trajectories in combination with an improved K-Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (KANN).

In marine traffic applications, the clustering results may exhibit a customary route and traffic volume distribution. In order to improve the clustering performance of ship trajectory data, which is characterized by a large data volume and distribution complexity, a method consisting of Douglas-Peucker (DP)-based compression and density-based clustering is proposed. In the first part of the proposed method, the appropriate parameters for the DP algorithm were determined according to the shape changes in the trajectories, which were used to compress the trajectories prior to calculating the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance matrix. In the second part, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was improved in terms of determining the parameters. Based on the statistical characteristics of ship trajectory distribution, the appropriate DBSCAN parameters could be determined adaptively. Evaluation and comparison experiments were conducted based on massive real ship trajectories in the Chinese port of Beilun-Zhoushan. The results demonstrated that, compared to the traditional DTW distance, the proposed similarity measurement exhibits superior performance in terms of both time and quality.

"dbscan algorithm for ais data reconstruction","2021","Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel’s ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment’s drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.","clustering,DBSCAN,AIS data analysis,trajectory reconstruction,AIS,"
"maritime coverage enhancement using uavs coordinated with hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks","2020","Due to the agile maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great promise for on-demand communications. In practice, UAV-aided aerial base stations are not separate. Instead, they rely on existing satellites/terrestrial systems for spectrum sharing and efficient backhaul.

In this paper, we deploy UAVs for coverage enhancement of a hybrid satellite-terrestrial maritime communication network. Using a typical composite channel model including both large-scale and small-scale fading, the UAV trajectory and in-flight transmit power are jointly optimized, subject to constraints on UAV kinematics, tolerable interference, backhaul, and the total energy of the UAV for communications. Different from existing studies, only the location-dependent large-scale channel state information (CSI) is assumed available, because it is difficult to obtain the small-scale CSI before takeoff in practice and the ship positions can be obtained via the dedicated maritime Automatic Identification System.

"a probabilistic risk approach for the collision detection of multi-ships under spatiotemporal movement uncertainty","2021","It is vital to analyse ship collision risk for preventing collisions and improving safety at sea. The state-of-the-art of ship collision risk analysis focuses on encountering conflict between ship pairs, subject to a strong assumption of the ships having no/little spatiotemporal motion uncertainty. This paper proposes a probabilistic conflict detection approach to estimate potential collision risk of various multi-vessel encounters, in which the spatiotemporal-dependent patterns of ship motions are newly taken into account through quantifying the trajectory uncertainty distributions using AIS data. The estimation accuracy and efficiency are assured by employing a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, which provides the quantitative bounds on the approximation accuracy and allows for a fast estimation of conflict criticality. Several real experiments are conducted using the AIS-based trajectory data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed new approach. The results show that it enables the effective detection of collision risk timely and reliably in a complicated dynamic situation.

"multi-stage and multi-topology analysis of ship traffic complexity for probabilistic collision detection","2023","Maritime traffic situational awareness plays a vital role in the development of intelligent transportation-support systems. The state-of-the-art study focuses on near-miss collision risk between/among ships but reveals challenges in estimating large-scale traffic situations associated with dynamic and uncertain ship motions at a regional level. This study develops a systematic methodology to evaluate ship traffic complexity to comprehend the traffic situation in complex waters. In the new methodology, the topological and evolutionary characteristics of ship traffic networks and the uncertainty in ship movements are considered simultaneously to realise probabilistic collision detection. The methodology, through the effective integration of probabilistic conflict estimation and traffic complexity modelling and assessment, enables the evaluation of traffic complexity in a fine-grained hierarchical manner. With the AIS-based trajectory data collected from the world’s largest port (i.e. Ningbo-Zhoushan Port), a thorough validation of the evaluation performance is conducted and demonstrated through scenario analysis and model robustness. Moreover, some critical research results are obtained in terms of traffic network heterogeneity analysis; statistics including occurrence frequency, temporal distribution, life cycle, and transition probability of traffic complexity patterns; and correlation examination between the number of ships and traffic complexity patterns. These findings offer new insights into improving maritime traffic awareness capabilities and promoting maritime traffic safety management.","Ship traffic complexity,Maritime risk,Spatial-temporal traffic dynamics,AIS data,Network topology,Situation evolution,"

By estimating the trajectories of other vessels, sub-systems such as collision avoidance algorithms can plan ahead accordingly in order to avoid conflicts. To estimate the trajectories of other vessels, the use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a good candidate data-point, as this is becoming increasingly more common, and in some cases even mandated, on-board vessels. This paper presents a data-driven approach that uses the historical AIS data within a selected area in the Danish waters. The historical data is transformed into a probabilistic heat map using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and is further encoded using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) before entered into the estimation scheme. The estimation scheme consists of a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) configuration, which is sampled multiple times, yielding a single trajectory prediction with uncertainty. The performance of the estimation scheme is demonstrated and compared against two other commonly used methods, showing that the probabilistic heat map provides valuable information, compared to the baseline methods.","Autonomous Navigation,AIS Data,Machine Learning,Autonomous Marine Vessels,Trajectory Prediction,"

"deep reinforcement learning based trajectory optimization for magnetometer-mounted uav to landmine detection","2022","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a viable choice for data collection and landmine (LM) detection. The LM buried under the dirt or sand is detected using a UAV-mounted magnetometer in this paper. A UAV is deployed to gather data along the intended route when the magnetometer receives a signal from the LMs. During a whole round of data collection, we want to reduce the total energy consumption of the UAV-Magnetometer-LM system. To do this, we turn the energy consumption reduction issue into a limited combinatorial optimization problem by concurrently picking time slots and arranging the UAV’s visitation sequence to identify the LM. The problem of minimizing energy usage is NP-hard, making it difficult to solve optimally. In order to tackle this challenge, we used the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme. DDPG is used to enhance the convergence speed and eliminate redundant computations. Furthermore, to improve the detection in real-time, we proposed the proximal online policy technique (POPT). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme consumes 37.14%, 31.25%, and 21.42% better results than synthetic aperture radar (SAR), convolution neural network (CNN), and double deep recurrent Q-network (DDRQN).","DRL,Magnetometer,Landmine,Energy,UAV,"

"vc-gan: classifying vessel types by maritime trajectories using generative adversarial networks","2020","As maritime transport is the backbone of global trade, it is important to ensure the safety and security for sea transportation effectively. However, the dependence on experienced human operators for maritime surveillance does not scale in terms of coverage. While the ship information and trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can be used to automate maritime surveillance, the AIS data may be modified deliberately or accidentally, resulting in difficulties in the detection of illegal maritime activities. We have developed VC-GAN for Vessel Classification using Generative Adversarial Networks to identify vessel types based solely on the vessel trajectories in areas of interest. Our VC-GAN framework adversarially trains a multi-class classifier by learning from the labelled AIS data to classify the types of the vessels of interest, as well as to detect the out-of-class vessels.

"novel climates: trajectories of climate change beyond the boundaries of british columbia’s forest management knowledge system","2018","The non-stationary climates of the 21st century are compelling forest managers to seek non-local species, provenances, and silvicultural regimes that are better suited to the anticipated future climates of their operating areas. Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province’s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC’s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.","Mahalanobis distance,Bioclimate,No-analog,Novel climates,Random Forest,Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification,"

"a dual linear autoencoder approach for vessel trajectory prediction using historical ais data","2020","Advances in artificial intelligence are driving the development of intelligent transportation systems, with the purpose of enhancing the safety and efficiency of such systems. One of the most important aspects of maritime safety is effective collision avoidance. In this study, a novel dual linear autoencoder approach is suggested to predict the future trajectory of a selected vessel. Such predictions can serve as a decision support tool to evaluate the future risk of ship collisions. Inspired by generative models, the method suggests to predict the future trajectory of a vessel based on historical AIS data. Using unsupervised learning to facilitate trajectory clustering and classification, the method utilizes a cluster of historical AIS trajectories to predict the trajectory of a selected vessel. Similar methods predict future states iteratively, where states are dependent upon the prior predictions. The method in this study, however, suggests predicting an entire trajectory, where all states are predicted jointly. Further, the method estimates a latent distribution of the possible future trajectories of the selected vessel. By sampling from this distribution, multiple trajectories are predicted. The uncertainties of the predicted vessel positions are also quantified in this study.","Collision avoidance,Autoencoder,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Machine learning,Maritime situation awareness,"

"asynchronous trajectory matching-based multimodal maritime data fusion for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways","2023","The automatic identification system (AIS) and video cameras have been widely exploited for vessel traffic surveillance in inland waterways. The AIS data could provide vessel identity and dynamic information on vessel position and movements. In contrast, the video data could describe the visual appearances of moving vessels without knowing the information on identity, position, movements, etc. To further improve vessel traffic surveillance, it becomes necessary to fuse the AIS and video data to simultaneously capture the visual features, identity, and dynamic information for the vessels of interest. However, the performance of AIS and video data fusion is susceptible to issues such as data spatial difference, message asynchronous transmission, visual object occlusion, etc. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based simple online and real-time vessel data fusion method (termed DeepSORVF). We first extract the AIS-and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose an asynchronous trajectory matching method to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS-and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledge-driven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions. To validate the efficacy of our DeepSORVF, we have also constructed a new benchmark dataset (termed FVessel) for vessel detection, tracking, and data fusion. It consists of many videos and the corresponding AIS data collected in various weather conditions and locations. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method is capable of guaranteeing high-reliable data fusion and anti-occlusion vessel tracking.

"mimo unmanned surface vessels enabled maritime wireless network coexisting with satellite network: beamforming and trajectory design","2023","Due to the flexible deployment, unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have attracted much interest recently. To solve the resource scarcity problem at sea, USV needs to leverage existing terrestrial and satellite systems for efficient backhaul and spectrum sharing.

However, how to adopt MIMO technology into maritime networks with a sparse scattering environment is still an open issue. In this paper, we employ a multi-antenna USV to support on-demand communications. Utilizing the two-ray channel, we aim to maximize the sum throughput over all USV intended users, by jointly optimizing the cooperative beamforming and trajectory, subject to several practical constraints, including the USV kinetics, quality of service requirement and backhaul capacity. Different from existing whole period designs, we decompose the problem into sequential one-slot problems. Within each slot, the non-convex problem is solved iteratively by using problem decomposition and successive convex optimization methods.

"ais data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","2023","Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"
"decision support scheduling for maritime search and rescue planning with a system of uavs and fuel service stations","2015","When maritime accidents occur, search and rescue (SAR) operations for survivors are a top priority.

The goal of the rescue task is to follow survivors, transmit their location and status to the command center, and await the rescue team. In maritime SAR, the priority of a survivor being in a particular location changes with time due to current and wind. For persistent SAR operations with a system of UAVs, it is beneficial to simultaneously orchestrate the activities of multiple UAVs and fuel service stations. To address these problems, we develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) capable of generating efficient search and rescue operation plans.

"a framework for discovering maritime traffic conflict from ais network","2017","Thanks for the common use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) network has made a large number of the maritime traffic data to be available. Ships equipped with AIS automatically exchange navigational information with nearby ships and terrestrial AIS receivers to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of ships' location and movement for collision avoidance and control. Obviously, with increasing amount of maritime shipping traffic, the navigational collisions are one of the growing safety concerns in maritime traffic situation awareness. To understand the collision situations can help the maritime traffic managers to improve the safety control of maritime traffic. However, it is difficult to statistically analyze such collision due to the number of collected real cases of collisions are relatively low within a short period of time. To overcome the problem of low sample size, we discover traffic conflict from data collected by AIS network to substitute the real collision. Given a set of maritime traffic data collected from AIS network, we try to discover ships' movements that have conflict behaviors and these behaviors may bring a possible collision if they do not take any evasive action. We propose a framework of Clustering-and-Detection to automatically discover the clusters of conflict trajectory from AIS trajectory data in an unsupervised way. Based on real AIS data, the experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively discover sets of trajectory with conflict situation from maritime AIS traffic data.

These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods.

"nmtlat: a new robust mobile multi-target localization and tracking scheme in marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks under byzantine attack","2020","After a shipwreck (ship collision, explosion, disappearance, etc.), people rely on the marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks (MSR-WSNs) as one key weapon to locate and track drowning targets to save lives and assets. However, due to the complex and dynamic ocean environment, marine sensors could be captured by malicious attackers and then become Byzantine sensors. Byzantine sensors may tamper with the actual sensor data at a fixed or time-varying probability and transmit it to the data fusion center (DFC), which renders the normal localization and tracking function of the search and rescue system downgrade or even fail. To address this issue, we develop a New robust marine mobile Multi-Target LocAlization and Tracking scheme called NMTLAT by eliminating abnormal measurement data from the initial measurement data. NMTLAT works in several steps. By analyzing and mining sensors data and behavior, we firstly employ the information entropy of the system composed of a single sensor and their neighbor sensors to develop an efficient dynamic threshold based Byzantine node identification method. After migrating Byzantine sensors, the DFC utilizes sensor-aware and preprocessed marine data of the beacon or honest sensors to complete target localization and trajectory tracking. Specifically, NMTLAT consists of a novel distributed and cooperative multi-target localization and tracking algorithm using both received signal strength indication (RSSI) and priori information of sensors location. NMTLAT employs the importance sampling method to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the sensors and targets location. Furthermore, when the marine target is outside MSR-WSNs coverage, a piecewise function is utilized to characterize the likelihood of finding a drowning target in the search and rescue sea area. Finally, the Lyapunov’s second stability theorem is adopted to measure the stability of the NMTLAT. Our extensive simulation experiments validate that the NMTLAT performance is superior to existing solutions in various marine search and rescue scenarios.","Importance sampling,Lyapunov’s stability theorem,Information entropy,Maritime search and rescue wireless sensor networks,Cooperative localization and tracking,Byzantine sensor identification,"
"maritime situation analysis framework: vessel interaction classification and anomaly detection","2015","Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge.

"a time domain-based iterative method for helicopter maritime search area planning and construction of the simulation environment","2020","Helicopters are widely used in maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions. To improve the probability of success (POS) of SAR missions, search areas should be carefully planned. However, the search area is usually determined based on the survivors' probable locations at a given moment by existing planning methods, while the effects of the relative motion between the helicopter and the search objects are ignored, possibly leading to a significant decrease in the POS. To minimize the impact of search object motion, a time domain-based iterative planning (TIP) method is proposed in this article to obtain the optimal search areas. The survivors' probable locations and mean drift direction are updated iteratively, while the probability map is developed by taking survivors' mean drift direction as a reference. Then, the optimal search area is determined by an iterative search method starting from the cell with the highest probability of containment. To evaluate the effectiveness of a search plan, an agent-based simulation environment of a maritime search mission is constructed based on the AnyLogic simulation platform. Taking a capsizing case as an example, the simulation results show that the novel TIP method minimizes the impact of search object motion on the search effectiveness and obtains higher POS values than those obtained by other methods.","TIP method,maritime search mission,search plan,Planning,Search problems,Agent-based modeling,POS,Helicopters,planning methods,motion control,simulation environment,aircraft control,optimisation,time domain-based iterative planning method,synthetic aperture radar,optimal search area,anyLogic,helicopter maritime search area planning,mean drift direction,iterative methods,search problems,probability map,search and rescue,Trajectory,helicopters,mission area planning,probability,SAR missions,Iterative methods,Computational modeling,search objects,Fuels,"

"exploring ais data for intelligent maritime routes extraction","2020","Maritime traffic route is the basis for the analysis of ship traffic characteristics and navigation safety. However, the spatial freedom of ship navigation makes the extraction of maritime traffic route a challenging task. In order to realize the extraction of ship traffic routes at sea, a maritime route extraction method based on ship history automatic identification system (AIS) data is proposed. In this method, the ship trajectory with rich position information is transformed into a ship trip semantic object (STSO) with semantic information, and each ship trip is abstracted as a “stop-waypoint-stop” trip object. In addition, based on the graph theory, the STSO is further integrated into the nodes and edges of a directed maritime traffic graph to realize the extraction and expression of the shipping routes. In order to prove the effectiveness of this method, the real-world AIS historical data are used for testing, and the results show that this method can effectively extract maritime traffic routes.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Semantic trajectory,Shipping route,Maritime traffic,Graph theory,"
"joint optimization of trajectory and power allocation for usv-assisted maritime wireless network","2021","Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have attracted significant interest recently in maritime wireless communication. This paper studies a USV-assisted maritime wireless network where the USV is employed to support the communication connection between the terrestrial base station (TBS) and ship. Considering the maritime environment characteristic and earth curvature, we establish a systematic USV kinetics and information transmission model. An expected throughput maximization problem is then formulated, where the USV trajectory and power allocation are jointly considered, subject to the constraints of kinematics, safe sailing, line-of-sight (LoS) link distances, power allocation, and information-causality. Due to the complexity of the maritime two-ray signal propagation model, we propose a channel approximation method to find the upper bound of the throughput. The problem is solved by using problem decomposition, successive convex approximation, and interior-point methods. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the adoption of USV by the maritime wireless network can significantly improve communication performance.","line-of-sight link distances,Systematics,convex approximation,Throughput,Upper bound,information transmission model,convex programming,ship,safe sailing,channel approximation method,information-causality,maritime wireless communication,maritime environment characteristic,Wireless networks,interior-point method,ships,terrestrial base station,marine safety,power allocation,USV trajectory,earth curvature,TBS,Signal processing,throughput maximization problem,unmanned surface vehicles,systematic USV kinetics,marine communication,Simulation,Transforms,approximation theory,maritime two-ray signal propagation model,USV-assisted maritime wireless network,"
"an ais-based deep learning framework for regional ship behavior prediction","2021","This study presents a deep learning framework to support regional ship behavior prediction using historical AIS data. The framework is meant to aid in proactive collision avoidance, in order to enhance the safety of maritime transportation systems. In this study, it is suggested to decompose the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region into clusters. Each cluster will contain trajectories with similar behavior characteristics. For each unique cluster, the method generates a local model to describe the local behavior in the cluster. In this manner, higher fidelity predictions can be facilitated compared to training a model on all available historical behavior. The study suggests to cluster historical trajectories using a variational recurrent autoencoder and the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm. The past behavior of a selected vessel is then classified to the most likely clusters of behavior based on the softmax distribution. Each local model consists of a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. When utilizing the deep learning framework, a user inputs the past trajectory of a selected vessel, and the framework outputs the most likely future trajectories. The model was evaluated using a geographical region as a test case, with successful results.","Collision avoidance,Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"
"interval prediction of vessel trajectory based on lower and upper bound estimation and attention-modified lstm with bayesian optimization","2023","Uncertainty prediction of vessel trajectory is essential to enhance maritime situational awareness and traffic safety. Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval. (2) quantifying the prediction uncertainty and improving the reliability of trajectory predictor. (3) performing anomaly detection tasks using visualized trajectory prediction intervals. The research can help maritime traffic participants obtain more reliable trajectory data, which supports making more reasonable traffic supervision decisions.","Long short-term memory,Attention mechanism,Vessel trajectory,Lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE),Interval prediction,"

These techniques work well in a highly noise environment with constant velocity targets. However, some of these techniques are not applicable to targets that have acceleration as well as targets embedded in sea clutter.

"maritime small target detection based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency in infrared video with dense sunglints","2023","Maritime infrared (IR) small target detection in dense sunglint environments has always been challenging. It is difficult for existing methods to distinguish the small target from dense and strong sea clutter because the sea clutter caused by the sunglints has similar spatialâ€“temporal characteristics to small targets. This article proposes a method based on appearance stability and depth-normalized motion saliency (AS-DNMS) for small target detection in IR videos or sequences. First, on each frame of the IR video, the isotropic salience measure (ISM) based on principal curvature filtering is proposed for target enhancement, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract a stable number of candidate targets. Then, we use improved pipeline filtering to form trajectory chains of the candidate targets extracted from the consecutive frames. To improve the matching accuracy of pipeline filtering, we propose an inverse optical flow method to predict the local images of the candidate targets. Third, the motion vectors of the candidate targets are extracted and depth-normalized. According to the principle of projection perspective, a depth normalization model based on the position of the sea-sky line is established, providing a simple and low-cost solution for acquiring depth information of maritime targets under sea-sky backgrounds. Finally, the appearance stability measure (ASM) and the depth-normalized motion saliency measure (DNMSM) are calculated to construct the AS-DNMS joint feature. A double asymptote decision function is employed to determine the real target.

"flexible data integrity checking with original data recovery in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a promising technology that can be widely used in various industries to realize real-time information collection, so as to improve production efficiency and reduce running costs. By combining the technology of IoT, maritime transportation systems (MTS) can prevent vessels collision, improve the efficiency of maritime transportation and reduce the loss of revenue for ports and shipbuilders. The large amount of real-time data generated in IoT-enabled MTS can be efficiently utilized to predict the future trajectories and hotspots of vessels on the sea combined with historical data. However, the maritime traffic data in MTS cannot be effectively processed in traditional big data analysis methods, and the integrity of it needs to be checked before being used to achieve the prediction of trajectories and high-density areas of vessels. In this paper, we propose a flexible data integrity checking scheme with original data recovery in IoT-enabled MTS. In the proposed scheme, the data blocks of vessels are encoded based on the technology of erasure coding. To ensure the availability of the historical data, the existence and the integrity of the data elements stored in the cloud can be checked. Moreover, the original data blocks can be recovered efficiently if the encoded data elements have been corrupted or deleted.

"a contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction","2021","Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectoriesâ€™ simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods.

"seamless and energy-efficient maritime coverage in coordinated 6g spaceâ€“airâ€“sea non-terrestrial networks","2023","Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), which integrate space and aerial networks with terrestrial systems, are a key area in the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. As part of 6G, NTNs must provide pervasive connectivity to a wide range of devices, including smartphones, vehicles, sensors, robots, and maritime users. However, due to the high mobility and deployment of NTNs, managing the space-airâ€“sea (SAS) NTN resources, i.e., energy, power, and channel allocation, is a major challenge. The design of an SAS-NTN for energy-efficient resource allocation is investigated in this study. The goal is to maximize system energy efficiency (EE) by collaboratively optimizing user equipment (UE) association, power control, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployment. Given the limited payloads of UAVs, this work focuses on minimizing the total energy cost of UAVs (trajectory and transmission) while meeting EE requirements. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is proposed, followed by the development of an algorithm to decompose, and solve each problem distributedly. The binary (UE association) and continuous (power, deployment) variables are separated using the Bender decomposition (BD), and then the Dinkelbach algorithm (DA) is used to convert fractional programming into an equivalent solvable form in the subproblem. A standard optimization solver is utilized to deal with the complexity of the master problem for binary variables.

In the process of making maritime SAR decisions, a key factor affecting efficiency and success rate is how to quickly respond to accidents and develop an emergency response plan. At present, maritime SAR emergency response plans are still mostly obtained through a combination of drift prediction models and SAR experience. There is a lack of SAR resource scheduling and SAR task assignment. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of using an intelligent decision-making algorithm to formulate maritime SAR emergency response plans so as to produce results more scientifically.

"boom: bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy for cooperative maritime sensing","2023","With the advancements in sensing technologies, maritime sensing has become indispensable in various domains, including logistics, weather forecasting, and marine ranching. However, transmitting large volumes of sensing data faces many challenges in the maritime environment. Firstly, the transmissions purely depend on satellite links often costly and suffer from long propagation latency. On the other hand, traditional unicast transmission results in data duplication, wasting valuable marine communication resources. With the increasing density of sensing devices, the communication distance between maritime sensors has become closer, enabling the deployment of maritime opportunistic networks consisting of device-to-device links. Rather than using unicast transmission over satellite links, employing multicast with opportunistic routing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple destinations and saves communication resources. Even though the multicast method can avoid redundancy, conducting multicast without considering the maritime characteristics (i.e., the dynamics and the distribution of sensors) may lead to inefficient data delivery. Through real-world experiments, we observe that devices located on the edges of the network have a relatively low receiving rate compared with internal ones and tend to be the bottleneck of the overall multicast progress. Based on this observation, we propose BOOM, a bottleneck-aware opportunistic multicast strategy aiming at reducing multicast latency, taking into account the influence of the bottleneck node and broadcasting rate. Prominently, within maritime scenarios challenged by extreme conditions such as storms, typhoons, and tsunamis, BOOMâ€™s emphasis encompasses the adaptability of multicast strategies, which necessitates dynamic adjustments in response to equipment failures and shifts in network topology. Through mathematical analysis, we prove the formation of opportunistic multicast is an NP-hard problem and further design a heuristic algorithm based on the convex-hull method to reduce the computational cost in strategy generation. We compare BOOM with four other algorithms using real-world maritime vessel trajectories in various scenarios. The simulation result illustrates that the BOOM achieves a significant reduction in transmission latency, which reduces 36% when sensors are sparsely located in water areas, and the reduction could reach up to 59% when sensors are more dense. Furthermore, in extreme environmental testing conditions, BOOM continues to outperform other algorithms in terms of completion time, with performance improvements of up to 39% and 49% in sparse and dense topology environments respectively.","Data communication,Sensors,Task analysis,Maritime Sensing,Multicast Strategy,Marine vehicles,Satellite broadcasting,Wireless sensor networks,Opportunistic Multicast,Unicast,"

"a survey of mobility-aware multi-access edge computing: challenges, use cases and future directions","2023","Many mobile and pervasive applications avail cloud services to reduce overheads in on-device computation. The performance of these services depends on the available bandwidth of the underlying network, the physical proximity of the cloud server and the end devices, the volume of data, the computational capacity of the server, and, importantly, the mobility of the devices hosting the applications. Edge computing promises to provide better performance by bringing services (e.g., a video streaming service) from the cloud to servers near the user. It also enables partial or full offloading of the computation (tasks) and storage functionalities from the User Equipment (UE) to the edge of the network. This saves power and benefits from relatively more powerful devices at the edge. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which supports wireless and wired access technologies, has gained significant research interest. When UEs move, services must continue to operate, tasks may need to be offloaded again, and states related to tasks and services may need to be migrated. In this paper, we focus on four functional components (task/service offloading, resource allocation, content/task caching, and service/task migration) of MEC. We survey the challenges to these and their solutions in the context of UE mobility. Mobility creates challenges during offloading resource-intensive tasks as the user may move while the task is being offloaded. Some of the other challenges are how to jointly allocate computing and communication resources, minimize service down time during migration, and share the backhaul network if the same MEC host must continue to be used. Some key research areas include intelligent task offloading and service migration algorithms, exploiting group mobility to improve task migration time, studying the interplay of MEC parameters such as capabilities of the target MEC host, etc. In addition, predicting the mobile trajectory through intelligent methods and implementations with datasets from real-world scenarios are required. We compare this paper on 11 parameters (service migration, task offloading, resource allocation, content caching, mobility, use cases, architecture, computing paradigm, mobility model, system model, virtualization/Software Defined Networks) with 31 other survey papers from 2018 to April 2022 in MEC and related domains. We discuss the Edge Computing paradigm, the system architecture and model descriptions, and use cases.

The study finds: The oil transportation network of the MSR exhibits the characteristics of the small-world and scale-free as a whole; The space difference of degree and degree distribution is large, and the network centrality shows a trend of decreasing scale and stratification; In the oil transport network, the ports who have the three largest centralities are all the Jurong Port, which has the highest overall centrality and is in the absolute core position; The top 10 ports of the three centralities are basically similar, with only a slight difference in the position order. Most of them are distributed in ASEAN, West Asia and Western Europe, which have strong maritime transportation strength, larger maritime transportation radiation range and superior geographical location.","maritime oil transportation,oil transportation network,transportation,superior geographical location,West Asia,Maritime Silk Road,complex network theory,complex network,Oils,Asia,ASEAN,oil transport network,socio-economic effects,Artificial intelligence,Complex networks,geographic information systems,Roads,Trajectory,tanker trajectory,Western Europe,AIS trajectory data,"

The study focuses on the adjustment of a clustering technique to trajectory data, specifically using a DBSCAN algorithm that is adapted by means of two approaches. On the one hand, the DTW trajectory similarity metric is used to obtain a distance between two trajectories. On the other hand, an extraction of features of interest from each trajectory allowing a summary of the trajectory in a single multidimensional instance.

"intelligent anomaly detection of trajectories for iot empowered maritime transportation systems","2023","The convergence of Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) and Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the promising IoT-empowered MTS (IoT-MTS). However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS. Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer. The experiments were conducted on a real-world automatic identification system (AIS) dataset. The results indicate that the proposed TLTAD can provide accurate anomaly detection on shipsâ€™ trajectories in IoT-MTS with reduced model training times.","reduced model training times,Transportation,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,maritime transportation systems,anomaly detection,Internet of Things,transportation,Marine vehicles,abnormal trajectories,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient,highly negative impacts,model training time,ships,IoT-MTS,trajectory anomaly detection model,deep reinforcement learning algorithm,Data models,normal trajectory,reinforcement learning,maritime transportation ships,Artificial intelligence,real-world automatic identification system dataset,Maritime Transportation Systems,graph variational autoencoder,trained anomaly detection model,Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy,gradient methods,Deep reinforcement learning,model transfer,Trajectory,promising IoT-empowered MTS,intelligent Anomaly Detection,transfer learning,learning (artificial intelligence),data handling,Analytical models,"

"analysis of the activities of high sea fishing vessels from china, japan, and korea via ais data mining","2023","In addition to offshore fishing, high sea fishing has become another important supply channel for seafood. The pelagic catches of China, Japan, and Korea (CJK) account for 60% of the global total, and an analysis of their activities adds essential clarity regarding global fishery resources. This paper develops a framework for analyzing the activities of HSF vessels based on satellite AIS data from 2019, which is used to study the spatial-temporal characteristics of the lengths, speeds, trajectories, and trajectory densities of HSF vessels, the numbers of active vessels, and their average fishing times. The analysis results show that: 1) Chinese HSF vessels are mostly small, relative to Japanese and Korean ships; 2) The speed of Japanese HSF vessels is consistently the highest; 3) All HSF vessels mainly fish in the Northwest Pacific, Western Central Pacific, Eastern Central Pacific, Southeast Pacific, Eastern Central Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, and Western Indian Oceans; 4) The trajectory distribution of Chinese and Japanese vessels are similar, and both are more widely distributed than Korean vessels; 5) Chinese and Korean HSF vessels mostly enter the Atlantic through the Drake Passage, while Japanese ships mostly enter through the Panama Canal; 6) Chinese HSF vessels fish in Antarctic fisheries all year, while Korean ships aim to fish in Antarctic fisheries in the Spring, Summer, and Winter; 7) China has the largest number of HSF vessels in all fisheries, but their average fishing time is the shortest; 8) The average fishing time of all HSF vessels in Spring and Summer is short, increases during the Autumn, and continues to rise in some fisheries during Winter. This study is not only of great significance for the management and conservation of marine resources, but is also a valuable reference for the promotion of international cooperation in safeguarding marine fisheries.","High sea fishing,Pelagic fishery,Fishing vessel,Japan and Korea,China,AIS,"
"cannabis, an emerging aeroallergen in southeastern spain (region of murcia)","2022","The evolution of the behaviour of the Cannabis taxon in the Region of Murcia, Spain, has been analysed (in the cities of Cartagena, 1993–2020; Murcia, 2010–2020; and Lorca, 2010–2020). An attempt has been made to establish the origin of Cannabis pollen in this region to determine whether it is transported locally or from long distances based on air mass origins. Cannabis is an herbaceous, normally dioecious and anemophilous plant, which produces large quantities of pollen grains. It has been widely used for fibre (hemp), bird food (hempseed), essential oils and narcotics. The origin of Cannabis pollen grains has been established by calculating back trajectories at the altitudes of: 750, 1500 and 2500 m above mean sea level (m amsl); 350, 500 and 650 m amsl; and 10, 100 and 250 m amsl, using the HYSPLIT model. Considering this data, 29 days of Cannabis pollen potentially originating in Africa were identified in Cartagena, 19 days in Murcia and 15 days in Lorca. Of the remaining days, the air mass back trajectories showed local or regional pollen origins. These were 83 days in Cartagena, 61 days in Murcia and 57 days in Lorca. The presence of Cannabis in the bioaerosol of the Region of Murcia is irregular, and it is considered a minority pollen type. However, from 2017 to 2020, concentrations increased, with a positive and significant trend of 90% in the Annual Pollen Integral. The pollen season can be defined between June and August. This increase in the concentration of Cannabis pollen grains during this period coincides with an increase in local transport, suggesting the possibility of increased Cannabis cultivation in the study area.","cultivation expansion,Air mass back trajectory,Airborne pollen,pollen,Pollen transportation,"
"maritime group motion analysis: representation, learning, recognition, and deviation detection","2015","This paper introduces new concepts and methods in the analysis of group motions over extended periods of time, and applies it to an example from the maritime domain. Group motion analysis includes these challenges: (1) represent complex motion patterns of multiple entities as they execute group maneuvers and behavior patterns; (2) learn these group motion patterns in a qualitative fashion, invariant to the number of entities participating; (3) recognize such learned maneuvers and behaviors as they unfold in future group tracking data; and (4) detect in real-time deviations of an entity from a recognized group maneuver or behavior, as such motion anomalies may indicate a vessel emerging from a group. The approach adopts a linear field theory to represent the relative motions of objects, in combination with learning & recognition methods that self-organize three evolving field parameters into 3D clusters that represent maneuver categories, and categories sequences that represent behaviors.","Pattern recognition,motion analysis,image motion analysis,complex motion pattern representation,behavior pattern,learning methods,maritime group motion analysis,group tracking data,object tracking,marine engineering,object detection,group maneuvers,Tensile stress,Real-time systems,Indexes,Tracking,deviation detection,Trajectory,linear field theory,Sensors,maneuver behavior patterns,real-time deviations,learning (artificial intelligence),Group tracks,motion anomalies,"

"deeptracks: geopositioning maritime vehicles in video acquired from a moving platform","2021","Geopositioning and tracking a moving boat at sea is a very challenging problem, requiring boat detection, matching and estimating its GPS location from imagery with no common features. The problem can be stated as follows: given imagery from a camera mounted on a moving platform with known GPS location as the only valid sensor, we predict the geoposition of a target boat visible in images. Our solution uses recent ML algorithms, the camera-scene geometry and Bayesian filtering. The proposed pipeline first detects and tracks the target boatâ€™s location in the image with the strategy of tracking by detection. This image location is then converted to geoposition to the local sea coordinates referenced to the camera GPS location using plane projective geometry. Finally, target boat local coordinates are transformed to global GPS coordinates to estimate the geoposition. To achieve a smooth geotrajectory, we apply unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which implicitly overcomes small detection errors in the early stages of the pipeline. We tested the performance of our approach using GPS ground truth and show the accuracy and speed of the estimated geopositions. The source code will be made public once the paper is accepted.","Pipelines,DeepTracks,Kalman filters,Object Tracking by Detection,geoposition,Prediction algorithms,global GPS,Bayes methods,Cameras,Bayesian filtering,camera GPS location,pipeline,maritime vehicle geopositioning,Global Positioning System,image location,Unscented Kalman Filter,UKF,Filtering,camera-scene geometry,boats,unscented Kalman filter,Target tracking,cameras,object detection,video signal processing,moving platform,boat detection,marine engineering computing,GPS ground truth,plane projective geometry,local sea coordinates,Plane Projective Geometry,Boats,Geopositioning,GPS location,moving boat,ML algorithms,Deep Learning,target boat local coordinates,"
"detecting anomalous deviations from standard maritime routes using the ornsteinâ€“uhlenbeck process","2018","A novel anomaly detection procedure based on the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) mean-reverting stochastic process is presented. The considered anomaly is a vessel that deviates from a planned route, changing its nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. In order to hide this behavior, the vessel switches off its automatic identification system (AIS) device for a time  $T$ and then tries to revert to the previous nominal velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$. The decision that has to be made is declaring that a deviation either happened or not, relying only upon two consecutive AIS contacts. Furthermore, the extension to the scenario in which multiple contacts (e.g., radar) are available during the time period $T$ is also considered. A proper statistical hypothesis testing procedure that builds on the changes in the OU process long-term velocity parameter $\boldsymbol{v}_0$ of the vessel is the core of the proposed approach and enables the solution of the anomaly detection problem. Closed analytical forms are provided for the detection and false alarm probabilities of the hypothesis test.","real-world data,AIS contacts,Anomaly detection,anomaly detection problem,Marine vehicles,mean-reverting stochastic process,statistical hypothesis testing,target tracking,Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,automatic identification system,marine engineering,stochastic processes,statistical testing,radar,long term prediction of vessel motion,standard maritime routes,Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process,Artificial intelligence,maritime anomaly detection,Maritime surveillance,statistical hypothesis test,Trajectory,probability,anomalous deviation detection,Transponders,marine communication,anomaly detection procedure,Spaceborne radar,"
"a new road safety indicator based on vehicle trajectory analysis","2016","In 2014, in France, accidents on rural roads accounted for roughly 63% of road mortality (ONISR, 2014). Yet, the locations of accidents are increasingly spread, and it is becoming difficult for road managers to set priorities for interventions on their road network. They can no longer base their strategy on accident analysis. Road managers need to quickly measure the effectiveness of a modified facility, improvement of facilities or modification of the environment. On this type of site accident analysis requires a period of 3 to 5 years to determine the effectiveness of a change. This period of time does not meet the requirements of road managers or road users. To provide a high safety level, managers are implementing innovative developments: wall effect chicane at crossroads, dynamic warning signs, rural roundabouts, etc. Managers want to quickly assess these innovations. In addition, they have less and less money, so it is necessary to give them tools to help prioritize their intervention. It is also preferable for road managers to take preventive action rather than having to wait for accidents or serious injuries to occur, in order to carry out diagnosis and propose countermeasures. In this article, we propose a new safety indicator based on trajectory analysis. By trajectory, we mean a time-function that describes vehicle movement including not only its path on the road but also speeds and accelerations in both horizontal directions (longitudinal and transverse). These trajectories describe vehicle/infrastructure/driver interactions and reveal inadequacies that can lead to accidents. These trajectories are obtained using two roadside observation systems that analyse vehicle trajectories on two specific locations: curves and intersections on rural roads. The first tool is a local trajectory measurement system. It records trajectories of all vehicles passing through a specific zone. The goal is to observe abnormal paths that reveal dysfunctions in the vehicle/Infrastructure/driver system. The main applications-related contribution of this work focuses on developing a comprehensive solution for accurately estimating vehicle trajectories based on a combination of video images and range finder (telemeter) measurements. The purpose of the second tool is to improve understanding of dysfunctions at a crossroads and to evaluate the effectiveness of facilities. A precise study of patterns encountered on accident-prone intersections on rural roads showed that some situations are much more dangerous and frequent than others. In particular, most accidents at intersections are caused by vehicles crossing main roads. The second system presented in this paper detects and records conflicts between users on the secondary road who are crossing the main road, and users driving straight ahead on the main road. This kind of conflict represents the main type of accidents called crossing at grade accidents. The proposed risk indicator is equal to the number of conflicts (near-misses), weighted by the severity of the conflicts recorded in a given period. We chose to take the number of conflicts per hour. The purpose of these tools is to understand anomalies in the vehicle/infrastructure/driver system, and to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on safety. Associated with risk indicators they make it possible to objectively assess driver behaviours with respect to the road infrastructure.","safety,trajectories,curves,intersections,evaluation,"
"supporting maritime search and rescue missions through uas-based wireless localization","2018","The use of unmanned aircraft systems to support maritime search and rescue missions holds great potential. Applications range from the fast and efficient search of vessels and persons in distress to the provision of rescue and communication resources. In this paper, we address a received signal strength based localization method of persons without dedicated search and rescue equipment. The specific challenge addressed in this work is to analyze the proposed localization method under realistic conditions. Thus, a maritime channel model is implemented and by means of field tests experimentally validated. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated in a two step concept: In the first step the capability of different search patterns and localization algorithms is analyzed and evaluated in a hardware in the loop simulation environment. In the second step, a scaled experimental setup, which uses a technology comparable to cellular communications, is evaluated to prove the viability of the overall system. Besides the overall accuracy, the required localization time is a key performance indicator. The resulting outcome of the simulations using active trajectory generation underlines the potential of the discussed approach by achieving localization errors of lower than 200 m in under 10 mins. The experimental results obtained in the outdoor field test of under 30 m absolute euclidean error confirm the simulative results and verify that the proposed concept can significantly improve search and rescue operations.","Channel models,rescue missions,active trajectory generation,outdoor field test,Aircraft,hardware-in-the loop simulation,Wireless communication,Synthetic aperture radar,cellular communications,maritime channel model,cellular radio,rescue operations,Hardware,hardware in the loop simulation,communication resources,search patterns,unmanned aircraft systems,maritime search,required localization time,UAS-based wireless localization,Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),autonomous aerial vehicles,Search and Rescue (SAR),Wireless Localization,Trajectory,RSSI,Received Signal Strength,localization errors,Physics,marine communication,received signal strength,euclidean error,"
"joint optimization of trajectory and beamforming for usv-assisted maritime wireless network coexisting with satellite network","2022","Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have recently found increasing applications in marine scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the cooperative communication of the hybrid terrestrial-maritime wireless system coexisting with a satellite network, where a multi-antenna USV is used as the relay to assist the communication between the terrestrial base station (TBS) and marine users (MUs). Considering the shortage of communication resources, the USV shares the same frequency spectrum with the satellite network. Using the composite maritime two-ray channel, we aim to maximize the throughput over all MUs by optimizing the cooperative beamforming scheme and association jointly with the USV trÄ…jectory, subject to the constraints of USV kinematics, power consumption, quality-of-service requirements, and information-causality.

"trajectory design for uav-enabled maritime secure communications: a reinforcement learning approach","2022","This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled maritime secure communication network, where the UAV aims to provide the communication service to a legitimate mobile vessel in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In this maritime communication networks (MCNs), it is challenging for the UAV to determine its trajectory on the ocean, since it cannot land or replenish energy on the sea surface, the trajectory should be pre-designed before the UAV takes off. Furthermore, the take-off location of the UAV and the sea lane of the vessel may be random, which leads to a highly dynamic environment. To address these issues, we propose two reinforcement learning schemes, Q-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, to solve the discrete and continuous UAV trajectory design problem, respectively. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed reinforcement learning schemes versus the existing schemes in the literature. Additionally, the proposed DDPG algorithm converges faster and achieves higher utilities for the UAV, compared to the Q-learning algorithm.","Satellites,telecommunication security,physical layer security,remotely operated vehicles,Marine vehicles,control engineering computing,reinforcement learning schemes,unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled maritime secure communication network,MCN,UAV-enabled maritime secure communications,trajectory design,reinforcement learning,communication service,Autonomous aerial vehicles,continuous UAV trajectory design problem,autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,maritime communication networks (MCNs),Trajectory,marine communication,Signal to noise ratio,maritime communication networks,Q-learning,unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),telecommunication control,discrete UAV trajectory design problem,"
"deep reinforcement learning based latency minimization for mobile edge computing with virtualization in maritime uav communication network","2022","The rapid development of maritime activities has led to the emergence of more and more computation-intensive applications. In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using these two proposed algorithms, we can minimize the system latency.

"olive groves around the lake. a ten-thousand-year history of a cretan landscape (greece) reveals the dominant role of humans in making this mediterranean ecosystem","2021","The reconstruction of millennial-scale interactions between ecosystems and societies can provide unique and valuable references for understanding the creation of cultural landscapes and help elucidate their value, weaknesses and legacies. Among the most emblematic forms of Mediterranean land use, olive groves and pastoralism have occupied a prominent place. Therefore, it is vital to know when, how, and with what ecological consequences these practices were established and developed. Located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea, Crete is the largest island of Greece. The island is characterised by a long human history of land use, but our understanding of past environmental changes for the entire Holocene is fragmentary. This paper presents a new investigation of Lake Kournas in Crete, where recent coring provided a 15-m sequence covering ten millennia of land cover and land-use history. The study of this new core involves the analysis of the sediment dynamics, flood deposits, pollen, diatoms, fungal and algal remains, and microcharcoals. Results show that ecosystem development near Lake Kournas was not a linear process. They reveal linkages and feedbacks between vegetation, biodiversity, fire, human impact, erosion, and climate change. A possible human occupation and agro-pastoral activities around the lake may have been detected as early as 9500 cal BP, perhaps in a transitional phase between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. At 8500 cal BP, climatic conditions may have promoted the expansion of the evergreen oak woodland. However, human impact was probably the most important driver of ecosystem change with the establishment of an agro-system after 8000 years ago. Thereafter, the trajectory of Kournas’ lake and catchment ecosystems from the Mid to Late Holocene follow the rhythm of land-use change. Among the traditional Mediterranean land uses, olive cultivation locally played a major role in the socio-ecosystem interactions, providing economic benefits but also destabilising soils. During the last six millennia, three main phases of olive cultivation occurred during the Final Neolithic-Minoan period, the Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine (HRB) period and Modern times. Along with the changing land use under the successive political and economic influences rules, the resilience capacities of vegetation permitted it to shift back to higher biodiversity again after decreasing phases. Forest vegetation was always able to recover until the onset of the Venetian period (13th century), when woodlands were dramatically reduced. Only during the past century has forest vegetation slightly recovered, while the flood regime had already been altered during previous centuries. During the past 100 years, biodiversity markedly declined, probably in response to the industrialization of agriculture.","Olive grove,Land-use,Crete,Mediterranean,Paleoecology,Anthropisation,Human impacts,Holocene,Socio-ecosystem,Biodiversity,"
"ship trajectory prediction based on machine learning and deep learning: a systematic review and methods analysis","2023","Ship trajectory prediction based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data has attracted increasing interest as it helps prevent collision accidents and eliminate potential navigational conflicts. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to conduct a systematic analysis of all the prediction methods to help reveal their advantages to ensure safety at sea in different scenarios. It is particularly important and significant within the context of unmanned ships forming a new hybrid maritime traffic together with manned ships in the future. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the up-to-date ship trajectory prediction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning methods. To do so, five classical machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Back Propagation Network) and eight deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory, Gate Recurrent Unit, Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit, Sequence to Sequence, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network, and Transformer) are thoroughly analysed and compared from the algorithm essence and applications to excavate their features and adaptability for manned and unmanned ships. The findings reveal the characteristics of various prediction methods and provide valuable implications for different stakeholders to guide the best-fit choice of a particular method as the solution under a specific circumstance. It also makes contributions to the extraction of the research difficulties of ship trajectory prediction and the corresponding solutions that are put forward to guide the development of future research.","Deep learning,Maritime safety,Hybrid maritime traffic,Trajectory prediction,AIS data,Machine learning,"

"maritime route and vessel tracklet dataset for vessel-to-route association","2022","With an ever-increasing number of vessels at sea, the modelling, analysis and visualisation of maritime traffic are of paramount importance to support the monitoring tasks of maritime stakeholders. Sensors have been developed in this respect to track vessels and capture the maritime traffic at the global scale. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is transmitting maritime positional and nominative information at highest frequency rate, making it a valuable source for maritime traffic modelling. From an original AIS dataset covering the area of Brest, France, we extracted a set of 17 maritime routes, connecting ports in this area. Two different representations for the routes are provided: (1) clusters of AIS contacts, and (2) route prototypes, representing the nominal trajectory of the vessels following the route. Additionally, a set of tracklets (built by five consecutive AIS contacts from the same vessel trajectory) has been extracted from the set of routes and the original dataset, and labelled either with the route name to which they belong or as off-route tracklets. This dataset provides thus some ground truth on the routes followed by vessels and is aimed at testing and validating vessel-to-route or track-to-route association algorithms.","Track-to-route association,Vessel-to-route association,Route prototypes,Maritime routes,Automatic identification system,"

"vertical profile of aerosol characteristics including activation over a rain shadow region in india","2021","Unique airborne observations of aerosol size spectral and chemical characteristics over the peninsular Indian region are illustrated in this case study. Multimodal lognormal distributions were required to fit the observed in situ aerosol size distribution. The aerosol composition and mixing state was deduced from the single-particle analyses of aerosols using the transmission electron microscope and soot photometer coupled with satellite retrieved aerosol classification, and back trajectory analyses. Organic carbon was the most prominent aerosol type found at all altitudes. Refractory black carbon aerosols which constituted about 10–12% of the aerosols in the boundary layer were primarily internally mixed with both inorganic and organic coating. Other major aerosol types were dust and sea salt, with the latter primarily found below 2 km. Further, the cloud forming ability of in-situ aerosols is tested through a cloud condensation nuclei closure analysis.

The multimodal aerosol size distribution and hygroscopicity parameter (κ = 0.18) obtained for the cloud base aerosols over the rain shadow region are useful for studying aerosol-cloud interactions using regional cloud-resolving models.","CCN closure,CAIPEEX,Solapur,Lognormal distribution,Hygroscopicity parameter,"
"a deep spatiotemporal approach in maritime accident prediction: a case study of the territorial sea of south korea","2023","Predicting the risk of maritime accidents is crucial for improving traffic surveillance and marine safety. The availability of data sources and development of machine learning and deep learning methodologies can improve operational risk prediction. Similar to larger vessels, numerous ocean accidents are caused by small- and medium-sized vessels owing to poor conditions and defective equipment. This study aims at investigating the application of deep learning in both short- and long-term predictions of different types of accident risks associated with small vessels by considering multiple influencing factors. Herein, several big data sources that contain data collected from the territorial sea of South Korea, including ocean accidents, ocean depth, weather data, and small vessel trajectories, are utilized. Four machine learning and six deep learning algorithms are implemented and compared in nine scenarios with three different grid sizes using daily, weekly, and monthly models. The results reveal that although the performance of the proposed deep spatiotemporal ocean accident prediction (DSTOAP) model varies according to grid sizes and time intervals, its accuracy (more than 78%) makes it reliable for predicting accidents. Furthermore, although all types of accidents are captured with high accuracy, more than 84% of collision accidents can be predicted accurately. For practical applications, the results of this study can guide ocean accident management and safety planners in choosing appropriate methods for different time schedules and grid sizes, according to the range of coverage of the patrol ship.","Maritime risk,Deep learning,Vessel trajectory,Ocean accident prediction,"
"seaweed and climate change: a mapping review","2023","Seaweed has garnered increasing interest due to its capacity to mitigate climate change by curbing carbon emissions from agriculture, as well as its potential to serve as a supplement or alternative for dietary, livestock feed, or fuel source production. Moreover, seaweed is regarded as one of the earliest plant forms to have evolved on Earth. Owing to the extensive body of literature available and the uncertainty surrounding the future trajectory of seaweed research under evolving climate conditions, this review scrutinizes the structure, dynamics, and progression of the literature pertaining to seaweed and climate change. This analysis is grounded in the Web of Science Core Collection database, augmented by CiteSpace software. Furthermore, we discuss the productivity and influence of individual researchers, research organizations, countries, and scientific journals. To date, there have been 8047 articles published globally (after a series of filters and exclusions), with a notable upswing in publication frequency since 2018. The USA, China, and Australia are among the leading countries contributing to this research area. Our findings reveal that current research on seaweed and climate change encompasses 13 distinct research clusters, including “marine heatwave”, “temperate estuary”, “ocean acidification”, and “macroalgal bloom”. The most frequently cited keywords are “climate change”, “biomass”, “community”, and “photosynthesis”. The seaweed species most commonly referenced in relation to climate change include Gracilaria sp., Sargassum sp., Ecklonia maxima, and Macrocystis pyrifera. These results provide valuable guidance for shaping the direction of specialized topics concerning marine biodiversity under shifting climate conditions. We propose that seaweed production may be compromised during prolonged episodes of reduced water availability, emphasizing the need to formulate strategies to guarantee its continued viability. This article offers fresh perspectives on the analysis of seaweed research in the context of impending climate change.","Photosynthesis,Phytoplankton,Eutrophication,"
"safeway: improving the safety of autonomous waypoint detection in maritime using transformer and interpolation","2023","Detecting waypoints where vessels change their behavior (i.e., maneuvers, speed changes, etc.) is essential for optimizing vessel trajectories to increase the efficiency and safety of sailing. However, accurately detecting waypoints is challenging due to potential AIS data quality issues (i.e., missing or inaccurate messages). In this paper, we propose a five-step learning approach (SafeWay) to estimate waypoints on a given AIS trajectory. First, we interpolate trajectories to tackle AIS data quality issues. Then, we annotate historical trajectories by using an existing waypoint library that contains historical waypoints. As the historical waypoints are passage plans manually created by port operators considering sailing conditions at that time, they are not specific to other historical trajectories between the same ports. We, therefore, use a similarity metric to determine overlapping segments of historical trajectories with the historical waypoints from the waypoint library. Then, we build a transformer model to capture vessel movement patterns based on speed- and location-related features. We do not process location features directly to avoid learning location-specific context, but take into account tailored delta features. We test our approach on a real-world AIS dataset collected from the Norwegian Sea between Å lesund and Måløy and show its effectiveness in terms of a harmonic mean of purity and coverage, mean absolute error and detection rate on the task of detecting trajectory waypoints compared to a state-of-the-art approach. We also show the effectiveness of the trained model on the trajectories obtained from two other regions, the North Sea (London and Rotterdam) and the North Atlantic Ocean (Setubal and Gibraltar), on which the model has not been trained. The experiments indicate that our interpolation-enabled transformer design provides improvements in the safety of the estimated waypoints.","Transformers,Maritime,Interpolation,Safety,Trajectory prediction,Vessel,Maneuver,Waypoint detection,Automatic identification system,AIS,"

"a survey on uav-aided maritime communications: deployment considerations, applications, and future challenges","2023","Maritime activities represent a major domain of economic growth with several emerging maritime Internet of Things use cases, such as smart ports, autonomous navigation, and ocean monitoring systems. The major enabler for this exciting ecosystem is the provision of broadband, low-delay, and reliable wireless coverage to the ever-increasing number of vessels, buoys, platforms, sensors, and actuators. Towards this end, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in maritime communications introduces an aerial dimension to wireless connectivity going above and beyond current deployments, which are mainly relying on shore-based base stations with limited coverage and satellite links with high latency. Considering the potential of UAV-aided wireless communications, this survey presents the state-of-the-art in UAV-aided maritime communications, which, in general, are based on both conventional optimization and machine-learning-aided approaches. More specifically, relevant UAV-based network architectures are discussed together with the role of their building blocks.

"multi-label classification for ais data anomaly detection using wavelet transform","2022","Thanks to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), ships and other maritime equipment are able to communicate with each other, for example, by sending information about their position. This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction. The results of measuring the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real AIS data are presented.","telecommunication security,Clustering algorithms,incorrect AIS data,single satellite,Anomaly detection,Wavelet transforms,anomaly detection,random forests,collision course,Marine vehicles,Machine learning,damaged AIS messages,Data analysis,dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches,satellite communication,ships,wavelet transform,pattern classification,random forest,Classification algorithms,multiple terrestrial areas,pattern clustering,machine learning based framework,Artificial intelligence,multi-label classification,multilabel classification,wavelet transforms,satellite infrastructure,AIS data anomaly detection,maritime equipment,communication range,Trajectory,marine communication,Labeling,early collision detection,AIS data analysis,packet collision effect,satellite AIS deals,"

"advection pathways at the mt. cimone wmo-gaw station: seasonality, trends, and influence on atmospheric composition","2020","Relationships are analysed between advection pathways and atmospheric composition at the high-mountain station of Mt. Cimone (Italy), between 1998 and 2011. Back-trajectory cluster analysis identifies eight main advection pathways. A connection is demonstrated between the seasonality of airmass transport and atmospheric composition. Temporal trends and correlation of variables, flow types and teleconnection indices show, among other, decreasing trends of 210Pb (a radionuclide of crustal origin; −0.008 mBq m−3 year−1) as well as PM10 (−0.15 μg m−3 year−1), indicating that previously observed downward PM10 trends in Europe may actually be attributable to a combination of meteorological factors and decreasing anthropogenic emissions. The detection of a positive (negative) correlation of these tracers with Western (Arctic) air masses, showing significant downward (upward) trends at the study site, further confirms our findings. Lastly, relationships between teleconnection indices and atmospheric transport types/atmospheric variables are further analysed, focusing on large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and regional low-frequency atmospheric circulation pathways, the Mediterranean Oscillation and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation. The analysis reveals the important influence of such regional indices on the advection pathways.","Atmospheric radiotracers,Aerosol,Back-trajectories,Teleconnection,Trends,"

"leveraging graph and deep learning uncertainties to detect anomalous maritime trajectories","2022","Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalous trajectories in the transportation domain. However, some trajectories can exhibit heterogeneous maneuvering characteristics despite confining to normal patterns. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based trajectory representation and association scheme for extraction and confederation of traffic movement patterns, such that data patterns and uncertainty can be learned by deep learning (DL) models. This paper proposes the usage of a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict trajectory at future timesteps as well as estimate the data and model uncertainties associated, to detect anomalous maritime trajectories, such as unusual vessel maneuvering, using automatic identification system (AIS) data. Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of traffic patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.","Monte Carlo methods,classification,recurrent neural nets,graph,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Anomaly detection,DL models,graph-based trajectory representation,automatic identification system data,Monte Carlo dropout,graphical representation,traffic movement patterns,detect anomalous maritime trajectories,Predictive models,regression analysis,evidential deep learning,marine engineering,Data models,data patterns,pattern classification,Artificial intelligence,graph theory,RNN,regression,clustering,uncertainty,Trajectory,Uncertainty,probability,Computational modeling,traffic engineering computing,recurrent neural network-based evidential regression model,deep learning uncertainties,AIS data,"
"a novel hybrid approach for detecting abnormal vessel behavior in maritime traffic","2023","The Abnormal Behavior Detection of Vessels (ABVD) is crucial for enhancing Vesselsâ€™ situational awareness as well as achieving effective management of maritime traffic. Clustering algorithms are extensively employed for ABVD tasks, however, they are not only time-consuming but also frequently inaccurate when dealing with complex and dynamic vessel trajectory detection tasks. To address the above problems, we propose a novel hybrid approach, CSDLSTM(Course/Speed-DBSCAN and LSTM), which combines Density-based Clustering(DBSCAN) and long short-term memory networks to improve the efficiency of ABVD. Specifically, a three-dimensional CS-DBSCAN (Course/Speed-DBSCAN) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates speed and course features along with geospatial information in the clustering process to accurately describe vessel behavior. In addition, the clustering results are used as traffic patterns to train the LSTM predictor for real-time maritime anomaly detection.

"technologies to aid decision making for maritime security","2012","The paper presents 3 key technologies used in an integrated maritime reasoning and monitoring system [1]. These technologies fuse maritime data for decision support in the martime security domain.

Dynamic Bayesian Reasoning & Advanced Intelligent Networks (D'Brain), a reasoning system based on Bayesian networks. Causal and probabilistic information about scenarios of interest are structured as Bayesian networks, in which variables are set according to the interpretation of incoming situation information. The system thus provides a systematic approach to modelling and monitoring for scenarios of interest in the maritime situation. b. Graylist Ranking, a ranking technique to order entities based on their structural relationship with black-listed entities. The ranked list of entities could then be used to prioritize further investigation efforts into higher ranking entities which are considered more suspicious. c.

"loitering behavior detection and classification of vessel movements based on trajectory shape and convolutional neural networks","2022","To improve the ability of ship behavior detection in maritime safety surveillance, a new ship behavior of frequent turning within a certain spatial range, called ship loitering, was found under the ship behavior framework of 'anchored-off, straight-sailing, turning'. The concept of trajectory redundancy is defined as the quantitative representation of trajectory characteristics of ship loitering. A multi-scale sliding window-based ship loitering detection method is designed to process ship trajectories with different spatial ranges and time duration. Further, a shape recognition model based on a convolutional neural network is constructed and trained to identify four typical shapes of loitering trajectories. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the AIS trajectory data collected from the sea off the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the eastern North Pacific Ocean in 2017 and validated against the manual labeling results. The results illustrate that six general categories of ships produce loitering behaviors with different intentions. The characteristics of the spatial-temporal distribution of ship loitering behaviors can be represented as different shapes. The average precision of ship loitering detection reaches 96.5% and the average accuracy of four typical loitering trajectory shapes reaches 86.2%.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Loitering behavior,Ship trajectory,Automatic identification system (AIS),Sliding window,"

"development of denoising and compression algorithms for ais-based vessel trajectories","2022","Ship navigation information derived from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) is widely used in the shipping industry. As AIS reports are featured with huge volume and noises, preprocessing of AIS data is essential before its further application. This study aims to develop effective algorithms to denoise and compress raw trajectories derived from AIS reports. Specifically, an effective noise detection method based on statistical theory and sliding window is first proposed to identify glitches in a given trajectory. Linear interpolation is further used to rectify the glitches detected. Then, two modes of algorithms are proposed for trajectory compression: static mode with preset threshold for compression and dynamic mode considering the distance between trajectory points and the coastline in a real-time manner. Numerical experiments show that the noise detection and rectification algorithms and the trajectory compression algorithms are accurate and highly efficient considering compression rate, information loss, and computation time. The main innovation of this research includes developing an accurate and robust trajectory glitch detection and rectification algorithm, proposing two modes of trajectory compression algorithms, and combining the two tasks in a holistic robust framework. Especially, the dynamic compression mode can overcome a major problem encountered in static compression where the compressed trajectories may go across land. It can also deal with more flexible compression requirements and thus should be more applicable in practice.","Trajectory denoising,Trajectory compression,Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory point-coastline distance,Dynamic threshold,"
