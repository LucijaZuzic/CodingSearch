"deep distance metric learning for maritime vessel identification","2017","This paper addresses the problem of maritime vessel identification by exploiting the state-of-the-art techniques of distance metric learning and deep convolutional neural networks since vessels are the key constituents of marine surveillance. In order to increase the performance of visual vessel identification, we propose a joint learning framework which considers a classification and a distance metric learning cost function. The proposed method utilizes the quadruplet samples from a diverse image dataset to learn the ranking of the distances for hierarchical levels of labeling. The proposed method performs favorably well for vessel identification task against the conventional use of neuron activations towards the final layers of the classification networks. The proposed method achieves 60 percent vessel identification accuracy for 3965 different vessels without sacrificing vessel type classification accuracy.","labeling hierarchical levels,Pattern recognition,vessel identification,distance metric learning,Conferences,distance ranking learning,Neural networks,vessel type classification accuracy,deep learning,visual vessel identification,deep convolutional neural networks,image classification,joint learning framework,Measurement,maritime vessel identification,classification networks,Visualization,neuron activations,image dataset,marine vehicles,deep distance metric learning cost function,learning (artificial intelligence),Computer vision,marine surveillance,feedforward neural nets,Dogs,"

"fast cnn surveillance pipeline for fine-grained vessel classification and detection in maritime scenarios","2016","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very effective for many vision benchmarks in object detection and classification tasks. However, the computational complexity and object resolution requirements of CNNs limit their applicability in wide-view video surveillance settings where objects are small. This paper presents a CNN surveillance pipeline for vessel localization and classification in maritime video. The proposed pipeline is build upon the GPU implementation of Fast-R-CNN with three main steps:(1) Vessel filtering and regions proposal using low-cost weak object detectors based on hand-engineered features. (2) Deep CNN features of the candidates regions are computed with one feed-forward pass from the high-level layer of a fine-tuned VGG16 network. (3) Fine-grained classification is performed using CNN features and a support vector machine classifier with linear kernel for object verification. The performance of the proposed pipeline is compared with other popular CNN architectures with respect to detection accuracy and evaluation speed.

"development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification of marine systems","2022","As part of any Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system for the shipping industry, the determination of the current health of marine systems is fundamental. As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task. To highlight the performance of this methodology, anomalies have been simulated considering the power parameter of a diesel generator. Results demonstrated the potential of time series imaging and image classification approaches, as the Markov-CNN achieved an accuracy of 95% when performing the fault classification task.","Anomaly identification,Time series imaging,Marine systems,Fault diagnosis,Prognostics and health management (PHM),Fault classification,Shipping industry,"

"a semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on ais data","2022","Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","Vessel trajectory classification,Variational autoencoder,Deep learning,Semi-supervised learning,Automatic identification system,"
"shipnet for semantic segmentation on vhr maritime imagery","2018","For VHR maritime images, sematic segmentation is a new research hotspot and plays an important role in coastline navigation, resource management and territory protection. Without enough labeled training data, it is a challenge to separate small objects on a large scale while segment the big area clearly. To deal with it, we propose a novel ShipNet and design a weighted loss function for simultaneous sea-land segmentation and ship detection. To prove the proposed method, we also built and opened a new dataset to the community which contains VHR multiscale maritime images. Compared with the FCN and ResNet, the proposed method got much better F1 scores 85.90% for ship class and 97.54% overall accuracy.

"convolutional neural network-based novel framework for ship recognition in poor visibility maritime surveillance videos","2023","Ship recognition is a central component of the information perception for smart ships. Traditionally, the ship recognition mission is completed by remote sensing or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or manual calibration via maritime surveillance video. However, the difficulty arises in implementing the mission when it suffers the weather with a poor visibility. The recognition accuracy may deteriorate dramatically in such a hostile environment, especially in the heavy fog environment at sea when using conventional methods. In this case, we develop a novel framework for ship recognition based on a smart recognition system that relies on the dark channel defogging and the neural networks. First, a dark-channel defogging algorithm is utilized to remove the adverse impact of poor visibility on recognition. After that, three different neural networks are used to train the defogged images (Specifically: Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3). Finally, we present qualitative and quantitative analyses of three different neural network models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a hostile environment, especially in fog weather with poor visibility at sea.","Image recognition,Neural networks,Ship recognition,Sea surface,Visualization,Surveillance,Robust framework,Marine vehicles,Statistical analysis,Convolutional Neural Networks,Defog method,"
"a semi-supervised deep learning model for ship encounter situation classification","2021","Maritime safety is an important issue for global shipping industries. Currently, most of collision accidents at sea are caused by the misjudgement of the ship’s operators. The deployment of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) can greatly reduce ships’ reliance on human operators by using an automated intelligent collision avoidance system to replace human decision-making. To successfully develop such a system, the capability of autonomously identifying other ships and evaluating their associated encountering situation is of paramount importance. In this paper, we aim to identify ships’ encounter situation modes using deep learning methods based upon the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. First, a segmentation process is developed to divide each ship’s AIS data into different segments that contain only one encounter situation mode. This is different to the majority of studies that have proposed encounter situation mode classification using hand-crafted features, which may not reflect the actual ship’s movement states. Furthermore, a number of present classification tasks are conducted using substantial labelled AIS data followed by a supervised training paradigm, which is not applicable to our dataset as it contains a large number of unlabelled AIS data. Therefore, a method called Semi-Supervised Convolutional Encoder–Decoder Network (SCEDN) for ship encounter situation classification based on AIS data is proposed. The structure of the network is not only able to automatically extract features from AIS segments but also share training parameters for the unlabelled data. The SCEDN uses an encoder–decoder convolutional structure with four channels for each segment (distance, speed, Time to the Closed Point of Approach (TCPA) and Distance to the Closed Point of Approach (DCPA)) been developed. The performance of the SCEDN model are evaluated by comparing to several baselines with the experimental results demonstrating a higher accuracy can be achieved by our proposed model.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Trajectory data,Deep learning,Convolutional neural network,Semi-supervised learning,Encounter situation classification,Encoder–decoder,"
"a camera-based deep-learning solution for visual attention zone recognition in maritime navigational operations","2022","The visual attention of navigators is imperative to understand the logic of navigation as well as the surveillance of navigators' status and operation. Current studies are implemented with the help of wearable eye-tracker glasses; yet, the high expenditure demanded by such equipment and service and its limitations on usability have impeded related research from further development. In this letter, the authors propose a framework, which is the first attempt in the maritime domain, to provide a camera-based deep-learning (CaBDeeL) visual attention recognition solution that outperforms the intrusive eye tracker regarding its shortcomings. A wide-angle camera is configured in front of the navigator in the advanced ship-bridge simulator in a way that visual attention reflected by their facial and head movements is captured in the front view. A pair of eye-tracker glasses is used to classify the captured visual attention images, which then form the primary database.

"a multi-task learning-based framework for global maritime trajectory and destination prediction with ais data","2022","Automatic Identification System (AIS) was initially developed for tracking ships and avoiding collisions. As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%.

"a ship movement classification based on automatic identification system (ais) data using convolutional neural network","2020","With a wide use of AIS data in maritime transportation, there is an increasing demand to develop algorithms to efficiently classify a ship’s AIS data into different movements (static, normal navigation and manoeuvring). To achieve this, several studies have been proposed to use labelled features but with the drawback of not being able to effectively extract the details of ship movement information. In addition, a ship movement is in a free space, which is different to a road vehicle’s movement in road grids, making it inconvenient to directly migrate the methods for GPS data classification into AIS data. To deal with these problems, a Convolutional Neural Network-Ship Movement Modes Classification (CNN-SMMC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The underlying concept of this method is to train a neural network to learn from the labelled AIS data, and the unlabelled AIS data can be effectively classified by using this trained network. More specifically, a Ship Movement Image Generation and Labelling (SMIGL) algorithm is first designed to convert a ship’s AIS trajectories into different movement images to make a full use of the CNN’s classification ability. Then, a CNN-SMMC architecture is built with a series of functional layers (convolutional layer, max-pooling layer, dense layer etc.) for ship movement classification with seven experiments been designed to find the optimal parameters for the CNN-SMMC. Considering the imbalanced features of AIS data, three metrics (average accuracy, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC)) are selected to evaluate the performance of the CNN-SMMC. Finally, several benchmark classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT)) are selected to compare with CNN-SMMC. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-SMMC has a better performance in the classification of AIS data.","Trajectory image,AUtomatic Identification System (AIS),Ship movement classification,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),"

"autonomous mooring towards autonomous maritime navigation and offshore operations","2020","Bollard is a vital component of mooring system. It is the anchor point for mooring ropes to be fixed in order to secure the vessel or ship. An algorithm that translates the segmented mask of bollard output from masked R-CNN along with bounding box and associated class probability to its corresponding edge coordinate and finally to the single reference point for efficient detection and classification of bollard towards autonomous mooring is presented. At first stage, Mask R-CNN framework is trained with custom built bollard. The model obtained from the training is inferred with real data resulting in instance segment of bollard. The segmented mask obtained contains relatively large amount of the data points representing the whole area of bollard, which typically is not desirable. In order to precisely localize the bollard with one reference co-ordinate, the proposed algorithm is applied to segmented mask. Firstly, it translates the segmented mask to only four co-ordinate points, where each point correspond to the edge of bollard. Further, from the edges, the reference point is estimated.

"a cnn-lstm network for augmenting target detection in real maritime wide area surveillance radar data","2020","Typical radar detectors exploit only a small proportion of the valuable information contained in radar reflections, i.e. magnitude and Doppler. A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper.

A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA.

"towards a convolutional neural network model for classifying regional ship collision risk levels for waterway risk analysis","2020","Estimating the navigational risk of vessels operating in sea and waterway areas is important for waterway risk management and pollution preparedness and response planning. Existing methods relying on a model-informed expert judgment of ship-ship collision risk are of limited practical use because periodic risk monitoring is feasible only when this can be done without extensive use of organizational resources. To alleviate such limitations, this article presents a new approach based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition to interpret and classify ship-ship collision risks in encounter scenarios. The specific aim of the article is to investigate whether a CNN-based model can quickly and accurately interpret images constructed based on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in terms of collision risk. To test this, estimates derived from training data are compared to validation data. It is also investigated whether adding additional navigational information based on AIS data improves the model's predictive accuracy. A case study with data from the Baltic Sea area is implemented, where various model design alternatives are tested as a proof-of-concept. The main finding of this work is that a CNN-based approach can indeed meet the specified design requirements, suggesting that this is a fruitful direction for future work.

In order to keep the recognition system robust in various underwater environments, this work proposes an adaptive generalized recognition system — AGNet (Adaptive Generalized Network). By converting fixed wavelet parameters into fine-grained learnable parameters, AGNet learns the characteristics of underwater sound at different frequencies. Its flexible and fine-grained design is conducive to capturing more background acoustic information (e.g., background noise, underwater transmission channel). To utilize the implicit information in wavelet spectrograms, AGNet adopts the convolutional neural network with parallel convolution attention modules as the classifier. Experiments reveal that our AGNet outperforms all baseline methods on several underwater acoustic datasets, and AGNet could benefit more from transfer learning. Moreover, AGNet shows robust performance against various interference factors.","Wavelet transform,Parallel convolution attention,Transfer learning,Ship-radiated noise recognition,Adaptive generalized network,"

"maritime ship detection using convolutional neural networks from satellite images","2021","The significance of efficient monitoring and control of marine traffic for the purpose of safety and security of the ships cannot be overemphasized in the current scenario where global trade and commerce is at its pinnacle. Various stakeholders are concerned with serious maritime issues related to hijacking of ships, illegal fishing, encroachments of sea borders, and illicit exchange of sea cargo, accidents, and military attacks. This requires an automated, accurate, fast, and robust sea monitoring system which can avoid or mitigate the negative effects of such issues.

Deep learning (DL) has been recognized as very promising for solving bottlenecks in the evolution of next generation communication systems. To adapt to the particularity of the marine environment, Rician fading channel is selected as the channel model for maritime communication. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network based end-to-end Autoencoder (CNN-AE) for the maritime communication system. A 1-dimensional convolution layers is introduced in AE. We investigate the characteristics of the maritime channel and optimize performance by redesigning the parameters. Compared with the existing schemes, the proposed CNN-AE maritime communication system not only inherits the characteristics of traditional AE system which can optimize all modules jointly, but also has the merits of CNN's local connection which can support more information.

"an unsupervised learning method with convolutional auto-encoder for vessel trajectory similarity computation","2021","To achieve reliable mining results for massive vessel trajectories, one of the most important challenges is how to efficiently compute the similarities between different vessel trajectories. The computation of vessel trajectory similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based methods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory similarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be guaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation results.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Convolutional auto-encoder (CAE),Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory clustering,Trajectory similarity,"

Modern Deep learning algorithms like CNN also aid in these missions. However, most models and datasets available focus on search and rescue missions on the ground or land. UAV-based search and rescue operations in the Maritime Scenario remain a challenge. This study focused on using deep learning algorithms such as CNN to precisely detect a human in peril with a swarm of drones.

To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based concept for maritime environment perception by using LiDAR as a primary sensor and AIS as an assisting information source. This approach consists of three functional modules: object detection, multi-object tracking, and static environment mapping. For object detection, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect floating objects represented as oriented bounding boxes. To train the CNN, we propose a method that generates simulated labeled datasets. The detected objects from CNN are tracked with Kalman Filter banks.

The traditional horizon detection algorithms based on hand-crafted features claim the advantage of being intuitive and highly targeted, however, their capability of detail extraction and robustness is not strong enough when switching among diverse scenes, meanwhile, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the powerful ability in feature acquisition, but has the disadvantages of interpretability and instability. Given this, this article proposes a novel horizon detection algorithm that combines the traditional method and CNN. First, the hyper-Laplace filter (HLF) is proposed to eliminate the interferences and enhance the saliency of the target. Then a positioning module (PM) based on the traditional idea which fully utilizes the structural characteristics of multifeature-maps in CNN is present to extract the endpoints of the horizon. Finally, an auxiliary module that consists of a revise branch (RB) and self-attention module (SAM) is designed to assist the PM with detailed corrections. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments based on three datasets with more than 25000 frames under various scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the best accuracy and highest stability but also addresses real-time needs. Notably, the detection deviation is controlled within 2 pixels on all three datasets while achieving a comparable detection speed of 170 frames/s. Besides, our algorithm also shows strong robustness even under harsh sea conditions and urban backgrounds.

"a deep semantic autoencoder for maritime wireless communications","2023","With the rapid development of maritime transportation, ocean tourism, monitoring, surveillance and aquaculture, the maritime communication industry has encountered new opportunities. Maritime End-to-end (E2E) communication systems based on deep learning (DL) have become diverse, while semantic communication systems have become a critical research point due to their ability to understand and analyze natural language. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic autoencoder (DSA) for maritime wireless communications. The DSA consists of a semantic encoder, channel encoder, channel decoder, and semantic decoder. The DSA employs transformers and convolutional neural networks to extract and restore the meaning of sentences while minimizing semantic errors during transmission. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the DSA in transmitting maritime data, the Rician fading channel is utilized to simulate complex and varied marine environments. Furthermore, the system parameters of the DSA are optimized through training the maritime data and calculating the loss functions.

"siamfpn: a deep learning method for accurate and real-time maritime ship tracking","2021","Visual object tracking plays an essential role in various maritime applications. However, most of the existing tracking methods belong to generative models, which only focus on the features of the object and require the target has significant visual saliency for accurate tracking.

In this paper, a deep learning based tracking method is proposed to track maritime ships, namely, SiamFPN. In SiamFPN, a modified Siamese Network is combined with multi-RPNs to build a tracking pipeline. Concretely, A ResNet-50 with an FPN structure is used as the CNN of the detection subnetwork of Siamese, and a template subnetwork is parallel to the detection. In order to strengthen the discriminative ability, three RPNs are deployed to process the output of Siamese Network. Moreover, a historical impacts based proposal selection method is developed for selecting correct target areas.

"infrared small dim target detection under maritime near seaâ€“sky line based on regional-division local contrast measure","2023","Infrared (IR) small dim target detection near the seaâ€“sky line (SSL) is crucial for enhancing the early warning capability of maritime vehicles. However, the interferences caused by the strong contrast have not been properly addressed. Consequently, a specially designed algorithm regional-division local contrast measure (RDLCM) that focuses on the detection of IR small dim targets appearing near the SSL is proposed. First, an SSL detection module based on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) is devised to achieve fast pixel-level SSL detection. Then, a set of regional-division windows (RDWs) are designed according to the strong grayscale contrast distribution around the SSL, and through the division of the effective regions, the RDWs could realize the potential extraction and refinement of the IR small dim targets that appear near the SSL.

"an automated sar-based method for ship detection in maritime surveillance system","2023","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active Earth observation system that can obtain high-resolution ocean images all day and all weather. It can be used for monitoring the marine environment, maritime traffic, and oil spills at sea. SAR provides accurate and real-time ocean information, which can ensure water traffic safety and ecological environment. Therefore, it plays an irreplaceable role in maritime surveillance. At present, deep-learning based object detection methods have achieved certain results in the application of ship detection in SAR images. Ship targets in SAR images have strong angular reflection characteristics, causing some parts of them to have large grayscale values, appearing as scattering points. At the same time, the heading of ship usually has a certain angle with the horizontal direction. Traditional deep-learning models do not have sufficient generalization ability for these situations. Horizontal bounding boxes also contain a large amount of background features, which affects the accuracy of the model. In response to these characteristics, first use convolutional neural network to extract ship features; Secondly, generate oriented proposals to reduce the impact of background features; Thirdly, using Canny and Harris to obtain features of ship edges and scattering points as attention mechanisms to enhance bounding box regression and classification; Finally, optimize the loss function, which will consider the influence of angle.

"intrusion detection for maritime transportation systems with batch federated aggregation","2023","As a fast-growing and promising technology, Internet of Things (IoT) significantly promotes the informationization and intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS). The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning.

However, object detection models trained on general objects datasets cannot be expected to give best performance for this scenario as marine vessels are only a small subset of these huge datasets and also do not classify the specific type of sea vehicle. Hence, their benchmarks are not appropriate for maritime surveillance.

"adaptive detection tracking system for autonomous uav maritime patrolling","2020","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally.

"loitering behavior detection and classification of vessel movements based on trajectory shape and convolutional neural networks","2022","To improve the ability of ship behavior detection in maritime safety surveillance, a new ship behavior of frequent turning within a certain spatial range, called ship loitering, was found under the ship behavior framework of 'anchored-off, straight-sailing, turning'. The concept of trajectory redundancy is defined as the quantitative representation of trajectory characteristics of ship loitering. A multi-scale sliding window-based ship loitering detection method is designed to process ship trajectories with different spatial ranges and time duration. Further, a shape recognition model based on a convolutional neural network is constructed and trained to identify four typical shapes of loitering trajectories. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using the AIS trajectory data collected from the sea off the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the eastern North Pacific Ocean in 2017 and validated against the manual labeling results. The results illustrate that six general categories of ships produce loitering behaviors with different intentions. The characteristics of the spatial-temporal distribution of ship loitering behaviors can be represented as different shapes.
