"rep-enhancer: re-parameterizing neural network for real-time low-light enhancement in visual maritime surveillance","2022","Vision-based maritime surveillance has become an essential part of the vessel traffic services system. The images collected in low-light maritime conditions often suffer from poor visibility. These images may significantly degenerate the performance of high-level visual tasks and increase the uncertainty in maritime surveillance. To address this problem, we propose a lightweight neural network (Rep-Enhancer) for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, we first design a re-parameterizable multi-branch edge extraction module, i.e., spatial domain-oriented convolution block (SDCB). Furthermore, skip connections and spatial attention operations are employed to strengthen the features. By exploiting these well-strengthened edge features, we can enhance the low-light images effectively with the encoder-decoder structure. The experimental results have shown that Rep-Enhancer can enhance the low-light image qualifiedly while maintaining great inference efficiency.","Traffic control,Image edge detection,surveillance,low-light images,low-light,Image enhancement,vessel traffic services system,lightweight neural network,high-level visual tasks,Rep-Enhancer,Feature extraction,image enhancement,Neural networks,edge detection,Visual effects,well-strengthened edge features,low-light maritime conditions,edge feature,maritime surveillance,computer vision,object detection,re-parameterization,multibranch edge extraction module,feature extraction,real-time low-light enhancement,visual maritime surveillance,spatial domain-oriented convolution block,low-light image enhancement,convolutional neural nets,Uncertainty,Surveillance,vision-based maritime surveillance,"
"a novel cnn-based autoencoder with channel feedback for intelligent maritime communications","2022","Driven by the rapid growth of maritime business, the research of reliable maritime communications has attracted great attention from both academic and industry. This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) -based autoencoder with channel feedback (CNN-AE-CF) for intelligent maritime communications with complex and changeable environment. A CNN-AE-CF is comprised of CNN layers, which inherits the breakthrough characteristics of CNN, such as generalization, feature learning, classification, and fast training convergence. In the CNN-AE-CF, we introduce a feedback channel and a feedback decoder at the transmitter to decode the feedback signals. Then, the transmitter combines feedback signals with input signals for secondary encoding. We leverage Rician fading channel to simulate the marine environment, in which CNN-AE-CF is trained. Finally, simulation results illustrate the superiority in terms of reliability and robustness. The proposed autoencoder is promising for intelligent maritime communications.","Decoding,Encoding,feedback,telecommunication computing,feedback signals,feedback channel,Transmitters,decoding,Rician channels,CNN,feedback decoder,maritime business,intelligent maritime communications,Robustness,convolutional neural nets,reliable maritime communications,channel feedback,Training,CNN layers,marine communication,autoencoder,Simulation,AI,learning (artificial intelligence),maritime communications,CNN-AE-CF,novel CNN-based autoencoder,"
"a semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on ais data","2022","Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","Vessel trajectory classification,Variational autoencoder,Deep learning,Semi-supervised learning,Automatic identification system,"
"a semi-supervised deep learning model for ship encounter situation classification","2021","Maritime safety is an important issue for global shipping industries. Currently, most of collision accidents at sea are caused by the misjudgement of the ship’s operators. The deployment of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) can greatly reduce ships’ reliance on human operators by using an automated intelligent collision avoidance system to replace human decision-making. To successfully develop such a system, the capability of autonomously identifying other ships and evaluating their associated encountering situation is of paramount importance. In this paper, we aim to identify ships’ encounter situation modes using deep learning methods based upon the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. First, a segmentation process is developed to divide each ship’s AIS data into different segments that contain only one encounter situation mode. This is different to the majority of studies that have proposed encounter situation mode classification using hand-crafted features, which may not reflect the actual ship’s movement states. Furthermore, a number of present classification tasks are conducted using substantial labelled AIS data followed by a supervised training paradigm, which is not applicable to our dataset as it contains a large number of unlabelled AIS data. Therefore, a method called Semi-Supervised Convolutional Encoder–Decoder Network (SCEDN) for ship encounter situation classification based on AIS data is proposed. The structure of the network is not only able to automatically extract features from AIS segments but also share training parameters for the unlabelled data. The SCEDN uses an encoder–decoder convolutional structure with four channels for each segment (distance, speed, Time to the Closed Point of Approach (TCPA) and Distance to the Closed Point of Approach (DCPA)) been developed. The performance of the SCEDN model are evaluated by comparing to several baselines with the experimental results demonstrating a higher accuracy can be achieved by our proposed model.","Automatic Identification System (AIS),Trajectory data,Deep learning,Convolutional neural network,Semi-supervised learning,Encounter situation classification,Encoder–decoder,"
"online fault detection in autonomous ferries: using fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection","2020","Enthusiasm for ship autonomy is flourishing in the maritime industry. In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.","operational reliability,generic threshold limit,acceleration calculation,fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm,variational autoencoder,engine loads,Anomaly detection,fault detector,reliability,multiregime normalization,Acceleration,ship autonomy,prognostics and health management (PHM),neural nets,Autonomous ferry,autonomous ferry crossing operations,system safety,data analysis,marine systems,ships,marine diesel engine degradation,Prognostics and health management,prognostics and health management system,online fault detection,dynamic threshold limit,Diesel engines,data-driven PHM system,mechanical engineering computing,feature selection,feature selection process,diesel engines,Fault detection,condition monitoring,Degradation,environmental conditions,marine diesel engine,maritime industry,failure analysis,Heuristic algorithms,multiregime normalization method,fault diagnosis,velocity calculation,faulty degradation data,"
"ship collision risk assessment based on collision detection algorithm","2020","Ningbo Zhoushan port handled 1.08 billion tons cargoes in 2018 which is considered as the one of biggest ports in the world. There are more than 1 000 ships enter or depart the port per day. Therefore, it is of importance to assess the collision risk for ships passing through the harbor area. In this article, a novel approach is initially proposed to assess ship collision risk in the harbor area based on collision detection technology of ship domain using automatic identified system (AIS) data. This study aims to build a unified framework of collision risk assessment which does not need to build different models in accordance with the ship domain we selected. To clean the historical motion data of ships, a method for anomaly detection of ship static information based on autoencoder (AE) is proposed. Based on the above proposed method, the ship collision frequency can be estimated, besides, the risk area can also be determined. The results obtained from the method could provide a reference on furthering enhance the navigational safety for the Maritime and Port Authority.","historical motion data,collision detection algorithm,Risk management,Safety,anomaly detection,Marine vehicles,safety,ships,marine safety,risk area,Data models,ship collision risk assessment,risk management,ship collision frequency,Artificial intelligence,sea ports,ship domain,risk assessment,automatic identified system data,autoencoder,Context modeling,Ningbo Zhoushan port,navigational safety,Navigation,collision detection,harbor area,Maritime and Port Authority,Waterway transportation,ship static information,"
"pixel-wise ship identification from maritime images via a semantic segmentation model","2022","Accurately identifying ships from maritime surveillance videos attracts increasing attention in the smart ship community, considering that the videos provide informative yet easily understandable spatialâ€“temporal traffic information for varied maritime traffic participants. Previous studies (e.g., ship detection and ship tracking) are conducted by learning distinct features from training samples labeled in terms of bounding boxes, and thus, background pixels may be wrongly trained as ship features. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel approach for achieving a pixel-wise ship segmentation and identification task through a novel design of U-Net deep learning architecture (denoted as EU-Net). The encoder of the EU-Net extracts distinct ship features from input maritime images, and its decoder outputs ship segmentation results in the pixel-wise manner. The proposed EU-Net model consists of encoder and decoder parts via the help of a convolution layer, a depth separable convolution layer, a softmax layer, and so on. More specifically, the EU-Net model identifies each pixel into ship or non-ship as the final output. Experimental results suggest that our proposed model can accurately identify ship (in terms of pixels), considering that the ship segmentation accuracies were larger than 99%. The proposed ship segmentation framework can be further adaptively deployed in the ship sensing system for maritime traffic situation awareness and intelligent visual navigation in a smart ship era.","maritime traffic situation awareness,identification task,Semantics,intelligent visual navigation,Kernel,pixel-wise ship segmentation,understandable spatial-temporal traffic information,deep learning (artificial intelligence),semantic segmentation,maritime surveillance videos,ship detection,EU-Net extracts distinct ship features,smart ship community,Marine vehicles,Feature extraction,input maritime images,Videos,ships,marine engineering,smart ship,ship sensing system,pixel-wise ship identification,object detection,ship segmentation results,feature extraction,image classification,EU-Net model,U-Net deep learning architecture,smart ship era,Convolution,background pixels,Image segmentation,ship segmentation accuracies,semantic segmentation model,maritime traffic participants,Depth separable convolution,image segmentation,video surveillance,ship segmentation framework,pixel-wise manner,"
"motion primitives learning of ship-ship interaction patterns in encounter situations","2022","Understanding the ship encounter situations is a tough task, since the uncertain motions of encountering ships and the long-lasting frequent interactions make the encounter processes dynamic and stochastic. If we can decompose these complex encounter processes into motion primitives, which represent the elementary interaction patterns, an encounter can be more easily understood and identified. In this study, we propose a two-stream Long Short-Term Memory-based autoencoder (LSTM-based AE) approach to extract motion primitives from multi-dimensional encounter data without specific rules and prior knowledge. This approach leverages the sequential representation ability of LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies of each encountering ship motion. Then, we developed a fusion gate named dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) to fuse the outputs of two LSTMs and generated the high-level representation needed to capture the spatiotemporal relationships of the interactions. After that, through a clustering method, the motion primitives were automatically extracted to describe various interaction patterns. The effectiveness of this approach was validated by naturalistic encounter data. The low reconstruction errors of the LSTM-based AE demonstrated that high-level representations captured the relationships of the interactions in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Case studies demonstrated that the utilization of motion primitives provided a semantically interpretable technique to analyze the interaction patterns and encounter process, which is conducive to situation awareness and decision-making for developing intelligent ships.","Motion primitives,Representation learning,Encounter situation,Two-stream LSTM,Ship-ship interaction,"
"wodis: water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation for autonomous surface vehicles in maritime environments","2021","A reliable obstacle detection system is crucial for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to realize fully autonomous navigation with no need of human intervention. However, the current detection methods have particular drawbacks, such as poor detection for small objects, low estimation accuracy caused by water surface reflection, and a high rate of false-positive on water-sky interference. Therefore, we propose a new encoder-decoder structured deep semantic segmentation network, which is a water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation (WODIS), to solve the abovementioned problems. The first design feature of WODIS utilizes the use of an encoder network to extract high-level data based on different sampling rates. In order to improve obstacle detection at sea-sky line areas, an attention refine module (ARM) activated by both global average pooling and max pooling to capture high-level information has been designed and integrated into WODIS. In addition, a feature fusion module (FFM) is introduced to help concatenate the multidimensional high-level features in the decoder network. The WODIS is tested and cross-validated using four different types of maritime datasets with the results demonstrating that the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of WODIS can achieve superior segmentation effects for sea-level obstacles to values as high as 91.3%.","fully autonomous navigation,high-level features,remotely operated vehicles,high-level information,robot vision,Cameras,current detection methods,encoder network,Feature extraction,reliable obstacle detection system,Laser radar,Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs),water surface reflection,Meteorology,deep neural networks,poor detection,high-level data,water-sky interference,deep semantic segmentation network,object detection,feature extraction,Sea surface,WODIS,autonomous surface vehicles,sea-level obstacles,obstacle detection,decoder network,Image segmentation,water obstacle detection network,mobile robots,Navigation,image segmentation,collision avoidance,"
"a novel model for ship trajectory anomaly detection based on gaussian mixture variational autoencoder","2023","The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model. This research can provide technical support for ship trajectory data analysis and risk management of maritime transportation.","Trajectory,anomaly detection of ship trajectory,Clustering algorithms,Classification algorithms,Mathematical models,gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (gmvae),unsupervised learning,Gaussian distribution,Marine vehicles,Artificial neural networks,intelligent transportation,AIS,"
"towards low-visibility enhancement in maritime video surveillance: an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network","2021","Limited by insufficient illumination, the images collected by maritime imaging devices often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, severe information loss, and so on. The above problems restrict the development of maritime- related work such as intelligent supervision, collision warning, accident investigation, etc. To improve the imaging quality of maritime video images, we propose an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network (termed EEMNN) for low-visibility enhancement. In particular, we fuse the multi-scale information extracted from the encoder-decoder module using the dense blocks (DBs) and attention blocks (ABs). It is capable of enhancing the fused information leading to preserving the edges, textures, and other fine details. To prevent the overexposure of enhanced images, we fuse and reconstruct the output features of DBs and ABs with the raw low-light image to get the final enhanced image through two residual blocks (RBs). The mixing of multiple network modules can effectively improve the generalization ability and robustness of our network. Through extensive experiments, EEMNN has higher objective evaluation indicators, more efficient enhancement, more natural maritime scenes, and stronger detail-preservation capabilities compared with other enhancement methods.","efficient and effective multideep neural network,natural maritime scenes,image denoising,Lighting,deep learning (artificial intelligence),Feature extraction,low-visibility enhancement,image enhancement,Neural networks,encoder-decoder module,insufficient illumination,attention blocks,dense blocks,information fusion,image colour analysis,ABs,residual blocks,image fusion,maritime video images,low-light image,object detection,intelligent supervision,feature extraction,image texture,multiple network modules,Video surveillance,stronger detail-preservation capabilities,video signal processing,Robustness,marine engineering computing,Fuses,DBs,Imaging,video surveillance,multiscale information,maritime imaging devices,maritime video surveillance,"
"water segmentation with superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy for unmanned surface vehicles in maritime environment","2022","As a mid-level vision task, water segmentation is essential for unmanned surface systems such as to get the sailing area and avoid the floating objects to ensure vehicles safety in maritime environment. However, existing deep learning method of water segmentation has a little weakness on maintaining origin-scale fineness. At the same time, our intuition is that ground truth is a powerful tool for optimizing the global network. In this paper, we give solutions through these two aspects using superior guidance and aligned fusion strategy.

"green rf/fso communications in cognitive relay-based space information networks for maritime surveillance","2019","In this paper, we provide an overview of a space-based network for the maritime surveillance information sharing and evaluate the coverage, the throughput and the real-time reception capacity of the presented systems. The focus is on the feeder link of a multi-hop geostationary satellite system. We propose a cognitive relay-based architecture for the inter-satellite and satellite-to-ground communication with a multi-band spectrum sensing operating on both free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) bands. Furthermore, modeling the spectrum sensing energy as a Gamma distribution we derive the formula of the network energy consumption in presence of multipath fading and considering two different data relay schemes: amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). We prove that the RF/FSO communication in the proposed relay-based architecture enhances the data transmission increasing the throughput and the real-time reception capacity and reducing the network energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the DF scheme overcomes the AF one in terms of energy consumption while the AF scheme overcomes the DF one in terms of probability detection, both experience the same throughput.

"smart anomaly detection for slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","2022","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used extensively for monitoring the world’s oceans, taking measurements of oceanographic characteristics along the water column. Presently, there is no holistic anomaly detection system in operation and AUVs require experienced pilots to monitor the progress of missions. This results in a large operational overhead and reduces the number of AUVs that can be deployed simultaneously. This article proposes an online anomaly detection system for underwater gliders based on a data-driven approach. A novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been developed and trained using field data from four deployments with healthy glider behaviour and then tested against four deployments where faults are present. The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies.

"an ais-based deep learning framework for regional ship behavior prediction","2021","This study presents a deep learning framework to support regional ship behavior prediction using historical AIS data. The framework is meant to aid in proactive collision avoidance, in order to enhance the safety of maritime transportation systems. In this study, it is suggested to decompose the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region into clusters. Each cluster will contain trajectories with similar behavior characteristics. For each unique cluster, the method generates a local model to describe the local behavior in the cluster. In this manner, higher fidelity predictions can be facilitated compared to training a model on all available historical behavior. The study suggests to cluster historical trajectories using a variational recurrent autoencoder and the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm. The past behavior of a selected vessel is then classified to the most likely clusters of behavior based on the softmax distribution. Each local model consists of a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. When utilizing the deep learning framework, a user inputs the past trajectory of a selected vessel, and the framework outputs the most likely future trajectories. The model was evaluated using a geographical region as a test case, with successful results.","Collision avoidance,Deep learning,Maritime safety,Trajectory prediction,AIS,Ship navigation,Maritime situation awareness,"
"flexible data integrity checking with original data recovery in iot-enabled maritime transportation systems","2023","Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a promising technology that can be widely used in various industries to realize real-time information collection, so as to improve production efficiency and reduce running costs. By combining the technology of IoT, maritime transportation systems (MTS) can prevent vessels collision, improve the efficiency of maritime transportation and reduce the loss of revenue for ports and shipbuilders. The large amount of real-time data generated in IoT-enabled MTS can be efficiently utilized to predict the future trajectories and hotspots of vessels on the sea combined with historical data. However, the maritime traffic data in MTS cannot be effectively processed in traditional big data analysis methods, and the integrity of it needs to be checked before being used to achieve the prediction of trajectories and high-density areas of vessels. In this paper, we propose a flexible data integrity checking scheme with original data recovery in IoT-enabled MTS. In the proposed scheme, the data blocks of vessels are encoded based on the technology of erasure coding. To ensure the availability of the historical data, the existence and the integrity of the data elements stored in the cloud can be checked. Moreover, the original data blocks can be recovered efficiently if the encoded data elements have been corrupted or deleted.

"mvffnet: multi-view feature fusion network for imbalanced ship classification","2021","The accurate classification of moving ships is of fundamental importance to maritime authorities for ensuring the safety and security of shipping operations. With the wide use of automatic identification systems (AISs), which allow ships to receive identification/location information from nearby ships, it is feasible to classify the types of ships by analysing ship behaviour from AIS-based trajectories. However, the imbalanced features of AIS data make it difficult to achieve satisfactory classification results in the presence of several different types of ships. To overcome these potential limitations, we propose a multi-view feature fusion network (MVFFNet) to achieve accurate ship classification with imbalanced data. To guarantee the powerful representation and generalization abilities of MVFFNet, we first extract several multi-view features (i.e., motion features and morphological features) from AIS-based ship trajectories. Several kinematic variables related to ship behaviour are empirically adopted as motion features. The morphological features are automatically extracted via convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) networks. CAE networks are capable of optimally learning the features from informative trajectory images, which are strictly related to the original ship trajectories. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) network is then proposed to combine multi-view features to generate the ship classification results. In addition, a hybrid loss function is presented to handle the imbalance problem of ship types, potentially leading to enhanced robustness and accuracy of ship classification. Comprehensive experiments on two realistic datasets have demonstrated that our proposed MVFFNet consistently outperforms other competing methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.","Ship classification,BiGRU,Imbalanced data,Multi-view feature fusion,CAE,"
"decoding the mechanism of formation in marine ooids: a review","2019","Ooid shoals, sedimentary structures consisting of carbonate grains, are often used as proxies to explore changes in seawater chemistry over Earth history. Despite their importance as contributors to the global carbonate budget and as paleo-environmental indicators for water depth, pH, temperature and water energy, the mechanism of formation of these concentric, sub-spherical concretions of tangentially or radially arranged aragonite or calcite crystals is still the subject of intense debate. Unlike oncoids, whose microbial origins are well acknowledged, ooids are traditionally viewed as abiotic grains, mainly produced in suspension by agitated, warm waters that are supersaturated with respect to CaCO3. Yet, there is considerable evidence, including geochemical bio-signatures and detection of viable microbes capable of mineralization and biofilm production and degradation, to suggest otherwise. The emergence of new and sophisticated technologies reveals that the level of microbial diversity of these sedimentary grains exceeds that of some microbialite systems. These findings have refined our understanding of ooid genesis and ooid accretion processes and argue toward microbial mediation both as a direct result of metabolic activities inducing changes in the environment conducive to precipitation and by a passive mechanism, in which mucilaginous extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) act as a template for mineral nucleation. Furthermore, new developments in the field indicate that carbonate mineralization in marine ooids occurs through sequential precipitations that involve an amorphous calcium carbonate phase (ACC), which some argue are of biotic origins. Herein, we discuss the most relevant theories of ooid formation, including some of the early pioneering studies that laid the groundwork for new theories attempting to decode the origins of these controversial grains.","Organomineralization,Ooids,Amorphous calcium carbonate,Microbial metabolism,EPS,Carbonate precipitation,Microbe-mineral interactions,"

"an unsupervised learning method with convolutional auto-encoder for vessel trajectory similarity computation","2021","To achieve reliable mining results for massive vessel trajectories, one of the most important challenges is how to efficiently compute the similarities between different vessel trajectories. The computation of vessel trajectory similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based methods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory similarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be guaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation results.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),Convolutional auto-encoder (CAE),Automatic identification system (AIS),Trajectory clustering,Trajectory similarity,"
"design of an end-to-end autoencoder for maritime communication system towards internet of vessels","2021","The Internet of Vessels has drawn more and more attention because the shipping efficiency and shipping safety can be increased, and the development of world transportation can easily be augment. Deep learning (DL) has been recognized as very promising for solving bottlenecks in the evolution of next generation communication systems.

We propose a Convolutional Neural Network based end-to-end Autoencoder (CNN-AE) for the maritime communication system. A 1-dimensional convolution layers is introduced in AE. We investigate the characteristics of the maritime channel and optimize performance by redesigning the parameters. Compared with the existing schemes, the proposed CNN-AE maritime communication system not only inherits the characteristics of traditional AE system which can optimize all modules jointly, but also has the merits of CNN's local connection which can support more information.

However, abnormal trajectories of maritime transportation ships can have highly negative impacts on the management of IoT-MTS. Therefore, anomaly detection of trajectories is important for the successful deployment of IoT-MTS. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Learning based Trajectory Anomaly Detection strategy, named TLTAD, for IoT-MTS.

"image-consistent detection of road anomalies as unpredictable patches","2023","We propose a novel method for anomaly detection primarily aiming at autonomous driving. The design of the method, called DaCUP (Detection of anomalies as Consistent Unpredictable Patches), is based on two general properties of anomalous objects: an anomaly is (i) not from a class that could be modelled and (ii) it is not similar (in appearance) to non-anomalous objects in the image. To this end, we propose a novel embedding bottleneck in an auto-encoder like architecture that enables modelling of a diverse, multi-modal known class appearance (e.g. road). Secondly, we introduce novel image-conditioned distance features that allow known class identification in a nearest-neighbour manner on-the-fly, greatly increasing its ability to distinguish true and false positives. Lastly, an inpainting module is utilized to model the uniqueness of detected anomalies and significantly reduce false positives by filtering regions that are similar, thus reconstructable from their neighbourhood. We demonstrate that filtering of regions based on their similarity to neighbour regions, using e.g. an inpainting module, is general and can be used with other methods for reduction of false positives. The proposed method is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for road anomaly detection and on a maritime benchmark for obstacle avoidance.

Such predictions can serve as a decision support tool to evaluate the future risk of ship collisions. Inspired by generative models, the method suggests to predict the future trajectory of a vessel based on historical AIS data. Using unsupervised learning to facilitate trajectory clustering and classification, the method utilizes a cluster of historical AIS trajectories to predict the trajectory of a selected vessel. Similar methods predict future states iteratively, where states are dependent upon the prior predictions. The method in this study, however, suggests predicting an entire trajectory, where all states are predicted jointly. Further, the method estimates a latent distribution of the possible future trajectories of the selected vessel. By sampling from this distribution, multiple trajectories are predicted.

To further improve the system performance, as well as for a fairness comparison, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) is utilized at the ship user. Specifically, to present the impact of the channel qualities, the scenarios of the weak and strong links that from the source to destination (S-D) are both considered. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the P-DF-CRN-NOMA are derived considering the three proposed forwarding cases. Qualitative numerical results corroborating our theoretical analysis, especially for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), show that the proposed P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme significantly improves the outage probability performance in comparison to the conventional CRN-NOMA schemes. Furthermore, for an increased S-D link, the corresponding outage probability performance will be also better for all the cases.","Decoding,telecommunication network reliability,cooperative relaying networks (CRN),nonorthogonal multiple access,Marine vehicles,non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),maritime space communications,outage probability,decoding,Power system reliability,NOMA,Communication networks,Relays,error statistics,power allocation,P-DF relaying channel,maximum ratio combining,cooperative relaying network,protocols,relay networks (telecommunication),diversity reception,partial decode and forward network,coastal base station,decode and forward communication,cooperative communication,probability,relay forwarding protocols,marine communication,outage probability performance,Probability,maritime communication networks,multi-access systems,island relay,partial decode-and-for-ward (P-DF),P-DF-CRN-NOMA scheme,"

"placement optimization of caching uav-assisted mobile relay maritime communication","2020","Recently, due to the deployment flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV-assisted mobile relay communication system has been widely used in the maritime communication. However, the performance of UAV-assisted mobile relay communication system is limited by the capacity of wireless backhaul link between base station and UAV In this paper, we consider a caching UAV-assisted decode-and-forward relay communication system in a downlink maritime communication. For the general case with multiple users, the optimal placement of UAV is obtained by solving the average achievable rate maximization problem through the one-dimensional linear search. For a special case with single user, we derive a semi closed-form expression of the optimal placement of UAV. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of analytical results and show that the optimal placement of UAV and the average achievable rate significantly depend on the cache capacity at UAV We also show the difference between the performances of the air-to-ground model and the air-to-sea model.","radio links,caching UAV-assisted decode-and-forward relay communication system,UAV-assisted mobile relay communication system,placement optimization,Wireless communication,air-to-sea model,achievable rate,Atmospheric modeling,caching UAV-assisted mobile relay maritime communication,Relays,mobile radio,maritime communication,relay networks (telecommunication),autonomous aerial vehicles,Optimization,Unmanned aerial vehicles,caching,air-to-ground model,Signal to noise ratio,Downlink,telecommunication control,UAV,"
