Accurate forecasting of container throughput is critical for policymakers and port authorities, especially in the context of the anomalous events of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we firstly proposed hybrid models for univariate time series forecasting to enhance prediction accuracy while eliminating the nonlinearity and multivariate limitations. Next, we compared the forecasting accuracy of different models with various training dataset extensions and forecasting horizons. Finally, we analysed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on container throughput forecasting and container transportation. An empirical analysis of container throughputs in the Yangtze River Delta region was performed for illustration and verification purposes. Error metrics analysis suggests that SARIMA-LSTM2 and SARIMA-SVR2 (configuration 2) have the best performance compared to other models and they can better predict the container traffic in the context of anomalous events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The results also reveal that, with an increase in the training dataset extensions, the accuracy of the models is improved, particularly in comparison with standard statistical models (i.e. SARIMA model). An accurate prediction can help strategic management and policymakers to better respond to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","","article","","128","","","Hybrid approaches for container traffic forecasting in the context of anomalous events: The case of the Yangtze River Delta region in the COVID-19 pandemic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X22002384","0967-070X","2022","1-12","Transport Policy"

Special attention was given to open-fire biomass burning episodes as extreme events common for the overall Mediterranean coastal area in order to gain a better understanding of the atmospheric variabilities and potential sources of trace organic pollutants in coastal environments. Diesel and gasoline combustion related to land and maritime traffic as well as occasional open-fire episodes (forest fires) were found to be the dominant pollution sources of PAHs in PM10 particles. NACs were determined almost exclusively in samples affected by biomass burning episodes. Open-fire episodes had a strong contribution to the overall NACs atmospheric deposition fluxes.

During the summer of 1993, sporadic mass mortalities (80–90%) occurred among C. virginica spat reared in the IFREMER laboratories in La Tremblade (Charente Maritime, France) and Bouin (Vendée, France). Affected oysters presented mantle retraction and deposition of an anomalous conchiolin layer on the inner surface of the shell. The incidence of oysters with gross signs exceeded 80%. No obvious pathogen was identified in soft tissues by histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, histological examination showed the presence of anomalous basophilic round structures, 0.5–1 μm in diameter, in gill and mantle connective tissues. These extracellular Feulgen-negative structures reacted positively with the von Kossa stain. TEM examination on mantle and gill samples in diseased spat showed that the basophilic bodies consisted of concentric deposits of an amorphous substance interpreted as containing calcium. These observations may indicate that the mineralization process in spat shells was disturbed without exact determination of the cause. Based on the similarities of the gross signs to those reported in juvenile eastern oysters in the United States, we believe that the cause of the mortalities observed in France was probably the Juvenile Oyster Disease. Moreover, we report for the first time the detection of anomalous amorphous structures in gill and mantle connective tissues associated with mortalities and deposition of an anomalous conchioloin layer on the inner shell surface in C. virginica spat.","","article","","79","","","Shell disease in eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, reared in France","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022201102000095","0022-2011","2002","1-6","Journal of Invertebrate Pathology"

In Canada, the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) extensively monitors and collects information on oily discharges using remote sensing devices. Despite the availability of data from NASP and other surveillance programs internationally, there is a paucity of spatial analyses of oil pollution patterns, particularly in their association with human marine pursuits. The objective of this paper is to analyze the association between observed oily discharges and human maritime activities in the Canadian Pacific Ocean. This study used Poisson regression to spatially model detected oily discharges with marine traffic, coastal facilities and proximity to coast. Further, it developed localized (‘regional’) models to address spatial heterogeneity. The models identify recreational activities, passenger traffic, commercial traffic, fisheries, and proximity to the coast as predictors of observed oily discharges. The regional models yield more accurate and reliable estimates of local associations, and identify more parsimonious sets of predictors for each region. By identifying and accounting for human activities most associated with oily discharge patterns, the models developed in this study could be used to estimate pollution rates in areas with less surveillance, and identify areas where NASP coverage may need to be increased. Spatially explicit rates estimated by these models can be used to monitor the effectiveness of programs and policy aimed at reducing discharge rates of oily pollution. This study can be used as a model approach for extending the analysis to the other coasts of Canada, using available NASP data.","","article","","52","","","Geospatial analysis of oil discharges observed by the National Aerial Surveillance Program in the Canadian Pacific Ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622814000800","0143-6228","2014","78-89","Applied Geography"

Shipping documentation may be deliberately manipulated to avoid shipping restrictions or customs duties. Well-known examples of such fraud are miscoding and smuggling. These are cases in which the documentation of a shipment does not correctly or entirely describe the goods in transit. In an attempt to reduce the risks of document fraud, shipping companies and customs authorities typically perform random audits to check the accompanying documentation of shipments. Although these audits detect many fraud schemes, they are quite labor intensive and do not scale to the massive amounts of cargo that is shipped each day. This paper investigates whether intelligent fraud detection systems can improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling by analyzing large sets of historical shipment data. We develop a Bayesian network that predicts the presence of goods on the cargo list of shipments. The predictions of the Bayesian network are compared with the accompanying documentation of a shipment to determine whether document fraud is perpetrated. We also show how a set of discriminative models can be derived from the topology of the Bayesian network and perform the same fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that intelligent fraud detection systems can considerably improve the detection of miscoding and smuggling compared to random audits.","","article","","99","","","Data-driven fraud detection in international shipping","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417418300083","0957-4174","2018","193-202","Expert Systems with Applications"

Indeed, despite significant technological advances, the rejected parts are still too high if compared to the more conventional manufacturing techniques. Several defects are known to affect the process, more likely when complex geometries are fabricated. Among these, the production of inclined thin walls without support structures is still critical and, in most cases, geometric distortions are observed on the overhanging surfaces. In order to overcome the above mentioned problems and improve the quality of these critical structures, an high resolution monitoring system based on Optical Tomography (OT) was proposed, called High Resolution-Optical Tomography (HR-OT). It uses a very high-resolution sensor, operating in the visible spectrum of light, on a large area of the surface layers comprising the entire printing platform. This very recent technique, typically applied for the detection of volumetric defects, such as porosity or lack of fusion, was successfully applied, in this paper, for the detection of geometric distortions, allowing to avoid onerous pre-processing phases in the image processing workflow. Specific geometric indexes were selected as monitoring outputs and were used for the construction of appropriate control charts in order to carry out statistical process monitoring. Finally, an off-line 3D reconstruction, by means of digital close range photogrammetry, was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring solution when applied for in-process detection of geometric distortions.","","article","","55","","","High resolution-optical tomography for in-process layerwise monitoring of a laser-powder bed fusion technology","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214860422002494","2214-8604","2022","102850","Additive Manufacturing"

Then, the ratio between the correlation levels of different satellite signals is introduced as a new criterion for distinguishing the spoofing signal from the authentic signal. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, it is implemented in a measurement and four laboratory data sets.

All this maritime facilities are getting older and there are effects like corrosion or malfunctions. In general, they need to be inspected frequently. For deep sea applications, security reasons and cost reduction autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be the first choice. The project “CView” addresses one of these inspection problems, the harbor inspection. But the algorithms, we present in this article can be adapted to many other inspection tasks. One of the main goals in this project is to find cracks or damaged areas at the underwater buildings or to observe critical sections under water with cost effective methods. The platform for developing the guidance algorithms for inspection is the AUV “SeaCat”. This underwater vehicle has a control software system with an user interface for mission planning, a mission control system, a precise navigation system, optimized motor control with an autopilot and sensors for obstacle detection and inspection. For obstacle and inspection target detection, a scanning sonar is used. The sonar images are automatically processed with edge detection and line extraction algorithms to get a simplified environment description, which is used by the guidance methods presented in this article. A pan–tilt enabled sensor head with camera, laser measurement and MBES (Multi Beam Echo Sounder) is used to inspect the detected objects. Additionally, these sensors provide distance information to the inspection object which can be used by the inspection guidance. This article presents methods for inspection using the online information from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle efficient and safely. It is also important to handle the interaction between mission planning and execution. During mission planning, the operator will define the type of the inspection object (wall, vessel, sluice, etc.). The algorithms we develop use the information from the mission planning and the online data from the vehicle sensors to guide the vehicle to get the optimal inspection results. Therefore, a precise distance control to the inspection object, collision avoidance and object recognition are needed.","","article","","67","","","Autonomous inspection of underwater structures","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889014002267","0921-8890","2015","80-86","Robotics and Autonomous Systems"

To address the issues that only qualitative evaluation using the ship domain and the distance to the closest point of approach (DCPA) does not reflect the true distance between the two ships when the closest point of approach (CPA) parameters are used, a novel ship collision risk evaluation model is proposed. (1) A fuzzy quaternion ship domain (FQSD) model is established for the own ship (OS) and the target ship (TS) at the same time.

To pursue this aim, we apply a cluster analysis on the most relevant principal modes extracted from a principal component analysis of the between-day correlation matrix. The characteristics of the identified patterns, as well as their interannual and monthly distribution, are presented and discussed. Moreover, using global and regional reanalysis products, we have determined the large-scale and mesoscale atmospheric circulation types associated with heavy precipitation patterns. The heavy precipitation episodes are generally triggered by an upper level trough approaching the southern Italy from west and promoting a very moist southwesterly flow. They have been clustered into six different patterns. The first four exhibit a rainfall amount distribution strongly connected with the orography of the investigated region. In such scenarios, the orographic lifting, the low-level wind convergence induced by the orography and the transport of moisture from local sources (the western and the southern Mediterranean) and from distant regions (the Atlantic and the Africa tropical areas) can be regarded as the primary forcing of heavy rainfall. In the other two patterns, the highest precipitation is generally observed in the coastal areas (Gulfs of Naples and Salerno) and in the northwestern side of the region (Caserta district), respectively. In such circumstances, the abundant precipitation is closely linked to convective activity over the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is sustained by a low-level convergence and, in the sixth pattern, by a moisture plume coming from the tropics. The results of this study provide new insights about the links between torrential precipitation spatial distribution and atmospheric circulation schemes in the southern Italy and promise to add a useful contribution for civil protection activities related to the management of environmental risks.","","article","","289","","","Classification of daily heavy precipitation patterns and associated synoptic types in the Campania Region (southern Italy)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809523001783","0169-8095","2023","106781","Atmospheric Research"

In this study, we extensively examined the temporal and spatial changes in precipitation and temperature over Zambia for the period 1950–2016. We used the modified Mann–Kendall (m-MK) test with the aim of eliminating the effect of autocorrelation on precipitation and temperature trends based on Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and National Centre for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) products. Overall, significant decrease (increase) in precipitation (temperature) was evident. We further observed that, on average, precipitation has been decreasing by 1.1 mm yr−1. The highest drying rate was observed recently in the 2010s with a decrease of −24.4 mm/year. An abrupt change in the trend of precipitation was reported in 1980/1981 significant at 5% significance level. The highest amount in mean annual rainfall was  1093.5 mm reported in the 1960s while the lowest (966.4 mm) was reported in the 1990s. During the core of the rainy season, the western and southern provinces of the country are observed to generally experience negative rainfall anomalies implying more precipitation deficits in these areas. Temperature has been observed to be on the rise since the 1980s and no sudden changes have been observed in its trend over the country. Results further indicate that temperature has been increasing at a rate of 0.01 °C yr−1. The highest temperature increment (0.08 °C yr−1) was observed in the 2000s. Spatial analyses showed that temperature anomalies were positive across the whole country with higher anomalies being manifested in the 2000s and 2010s especially across North-eastern areas of the country.

Detailed wave hindcast data is then employed to build state-of-the-art wave scatter diagrams along the route which allow the calculation of the ship responses for each sea state and the associated probability.

Recent geophysical investigations at Caesarea Maritima in Israel have discovered a thick, laterally extensive ballast layer in the area seaward of the 1st c. BC Roman harbour. The ballast deposits were identified by low-relief mounds on the seabed with elevated magnetic intensities. Jet probing and excavation of magnetic anomalies at several locations revealed a 20–60cm thick rubble layer containing large quantities of Late Roman and Byzantine pottery, local sedimentary boulders (kurkar sandstone, limestone cobbles) and foreign igneous and metamorphic boulders (granite, schist, volcanics; ca. 50%). The foreign boulders and pottery identify the rubble layer as ballast and ships refuse jettisoned by merchant ships outside the harbour. The strong magnetic contrast between the ballast deposits and the natural seabed sediments is attributed to the high magnetic susceptibility (>10−3SI) of crystalline boulders and pottery materials within the ballast rubble. AMS 14C and OSL dates and pottery evidence indicate the ballast accumulation began in the Late Roman period (ca. 200–330 AD) and continued well into the Late Byzantine (ca. 7th c. AD). The main phase of ballast deposition (ca. 4th–5th c. AD) coincided with a decline in the state of Caesarea's harbour following a destructive tsunami event in the early 2nd c. AD and records a shift to a more intensive use of the area seaward of the harbour as an anchorage and ballast lightening area.","","article","","36","","","Magnetic detection of ship ballast deposits and anchorage sites in King Herod's Roman harbour, Caesarea Maritima, Israel","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440309000958","0305-4403","2009","1516-1526","Journal of Archaeological Science"

However, the propagation characteristics of guided ultrasonic waves in in-service engineering structures are highly complex, which results in difficulties in developing precise and efficient signal feature mining methods.

Satellite altimeters can provide global coverage observations but with coarse temporal and spatial resolution, while tide gauges offer high-precision measurements but are limited to coastal regions. The advent of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) buoys bridge the gap between the tide station and the satellite altimeter, which realize continuous and reliable absolute SSH measurements in the coastal zone. However, most of buoys are equipped with GNSS geodetic receivers and antennas, which are expensive and with high power consumption. The emergence of low-cost receivers has been applied in fields such as autonomous driving and disaster monitoring, yet low-cost receivers suffer precision limitations due to signal quality issue in the harsh marine environment. To solve the reliability issue of low-cost receivers in SSH measurements, firstly, a low-cost buoy platform with four dual-frequency receivers is designed in this contribution. GNSS antennas are installed on the four corners of a square with a side length of 1.180 m, and the total power consumption is less than 4 W. Additionally, a robust outlier detection method, the Geometric Constraint algorithm, is proposed to improve the reliability and accuracy of GNSS SSH results. The performance of our buoy was validated in Jingye Lake at Tianjin University on April 30, 2022, and another experiment was conducted in Bohai Bay, Tianjin, on August 20, 2022, to assess the performance of a self-developed MG-Buoy for SSH measurement under real oceanic conditions. The experimental results indicate that the precision of single-frequency SSH measurement is 0.91 cm using the GNSS Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) technique with a single antenna, while the dual-frequency can achieve 0.50 cm accuracy. After adopting the Geometric Constraint method, the measurement accuracy of single-frequency and dual-frequency SSH values are 0.49 cm and 0.40 cm, respectively, representing a 46.2% and 20.0% improvements compared to the root mean square (RMS) value for the single GNSS antenna.","","article","","277","","","Sea surface height measurements using a low-cost GNSS buoy with multiple GNSS receivers","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823007461","0029-8018","2023","114362","Ocean Engineering"

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.","","article","","204","","","Identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product with an object-oriented approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717304820","0034-4257","2018","347-365","Remote Sensing of Environment"

The large chunks of plastic waste that decomposed down to micro- or nano plastics (MNPs) leads to various ill effects on biological entities. The conventional PET detection methods lack rapid detection of microplastics due to variances in microplastic features, long-drawn-out sample pre-processing procedures and complex instrumentation. Therefore, an instantaneous colorimetric evaluation of microplastic will ensures the simplicity of conducting assays on field. Several nanoparticle-based biosensors that detects proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites operate on either cluster or disperse state of nanoparticle. However, gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) emerges an ideal scaffold for sensory element in lateral flow biosensors due to their simple surface functionalization, unique optoelectronic properties and varied colour spectrum depending on morphologies and aggregation state. In this paper an effort has been made in the form of a hypothesis using in silico tools as a basis to detect polyethylene terephthalate (PET) – most abundant type of microplastic using gold nanoparticle based lateral flow biosensor. We retrieved sequences of PET-binding synthetic peptides and modelled their 3-D structure using I-Tasser server. The best protein model for each peptide sequences are docked with PET monomers – BHET, MHET and other PET polymeric ligands, to evaluate their binding affinities.

","","","","Drought, SPEI, Rainfall, Circulation patterns, Principal Components Analysis, Oman","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.105126","Spatial and temporal variability of drought in Oman was assessed for the period 1979–2014 using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at both seasonal (3-month) and annual (12-month) timescales. Changes in drought characteristics (e.g. frequency, duration, intensity, severity, and spatial extent) were detected for six distinct climatic regions delineated using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results suggest a statistically significant increase in the frequency and severity of drought during the past four decades. Nonetheless, drought exhibited pronounced decadal variability, with more frequent and severe droughts occurring after 1997/1998. Also, results demonstrate that the areas influenced by extreme and very extreme droughts witnessed a statistically significant increase on the order of 0.13% and 0.18%/decade, respectively, compared to −0.06%/decade for the areas impacted by mild droughts. Spatially, there has been a prevalent drying trend in central and eastern regions of Oman, while a tendency towards wetter conditions was observed in northern Oman (especially in the Batinah plain). This study also investigates the time-varying dependency between climatic drivers of drought and large-scale circulation patterns using the cumulative annual mean (CAM) method. Results indicate an acceleration of drying after 1997/1998, mainly due to the warming sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Atlantic Ocean in recent decades and also the shift of the Pacific Ocean circulation patterns (e.g. PDO and El Nino) from the positive to the negative mode at the end of the 1990s. These configurations are favorable for significant changes in the thermodynamic drivers of drought (i.e. air temperature and relative humidity), but have less influence on aerodynamic drivers (i.e. wind speed). The significant temperature rise in recent decades, combined with a significant decline of rainfall and relative humidity, can explain the prolonged drought episode lasting from 1998 to 2014. A comprehensive assessment of drought variability in a poorly-studied water-stressed region like Oman is of particular concern for stakeholders and policy-makers. This study provides meaningful conclusions and a basis for water resources management, agricultural and energy production, ecological protection, and contribute to more reliable drought mitigation strategies at the regional and national scales.","","article","","246","","","Evidence for intensification of meteorological droughts in Oman over the past four decades","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809520310620","0169-8095","2020","105126","Atmospheric Research"

In order to understand the nature and source of raw material and kilns, these shards were analysed for major elements with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), trace and rare earth elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). The analysis suggests that porcelain shards are siliceous in nature (SiO2~70%) and contain high Al2O3 (21.6%), Rb (388ppm) and Ba (160ppm) but have low Sr (48ppm). This composition suggests that the raw materials used for producing porcelain were silica, kaolinite and sericite which are characteristics of porcelains manufactured in Southern China. Comparatively, high Al2O3 (kaolinite) content in porcelains of the Qing Dynasty suggest improvement of quality, particularly mechanical strength, of Jingdezhen porcelain. In general, major element composition, trace metals, total rare earth elements (∑REE-67ppm) and their chondrite - normalized pattern of the Ming, Qing and late Qing period are nearly similar and appear to be made of identical raw materials.","","article","","14","","","Chemical composition and provenance of Chinese porcelain shards recovered from Old Goa, west coast of India","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X16306423","2352-409X","2017","467-478","Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports"

Satellite ocean color monitoring detects these changes as increases in chlorophyll and particulate backscattering. Detailed, high resolution analysis is needed to separate the optical effects of volcanic products from the response of the marine algal community. It is possible to calculate an index, which maps the magnitude of improbable change (relative to long term average conditions) following known volcanic eruptions by using low resolution, initial estimates of chlorophyll and backscatter along with an archived history of satellite data. We apply multivariate probability analysis to changes in global satellite ocean chlorophyll and particulate backscatter data to create a new metric for observing apparent biological responses to submarine eruptions.

Through clustering multidimensional trajectories which are accumulated in all kinds of electronic information systems, regular behaviors could be mined. Most of the trajectories clustering methods are clustering spatial position closed trajectories to a cluster. They cannot distinguish behaviors whose space position is similar but the moving speed and direction are quite different. Some sub-trajectory clustering methods which presented similarity measures considering segment direction, speed, and angle could solve this problem, but they are not suitable to some application scenarios which should clustering the whole trajectories. In this paper, we proposed a multidimensional trajectory clustering algorithm to mine regular behaviors by considering the attribute, type, position, velocity and course characteristics, and implement it on two experiments.

We define the MMWs as the warmings which break down the polar vortex, whereas the CEs are the episodes in which the polar vortex remains cold and undisturbed. Both anomalies lead to a wind anomaly around the north polar stratosphere, which is connected with a shortly lagged tropospheric anomaly through a stratosphere–troposphere coupling in winter. A T-mode principal component analysis (PCA) was used as an objective pattern classification method for identifying the main daily surface-level pressure (SLP) patterns for February for the 1961–1990 reference period. Subsequently, those February months with an MMW or a CE influence in the troposphere are identified in the whole study period (1958–2000) by means of the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI). Thus, performing the same analysis for the selected February months, new principal patterns for detecting changes in surface circulation structure and morphology are obtained. The results show a significant decrease in the westerlies and a southward shift of the storm tracks in Western Europe some weeks after an MMW occurrence, leading to an increase in precipitation in western Iberia and a slight decrease on the eastern Mediterranean fringe. The results are quite the opposite under a CE influence: the westerlies are strengthened and shifted northwards due to the displacement of the Atlantic anticyclone towards Central Europe; dry conditions are established throughout Iberia, except for the Mediterranean fringe, where precipitation shows a considerable increase due to the greater frequency of the northeasterly winds. Finally, an 11-year sunspot cycle–quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modulation might be demonstrated in Iberian rainfall in February through the occurrence of these stratospheric anomalies.","","article","","69","","","The role of the stratosphere in Iberian Peninsula rainfall: A preliminary approach in February","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682607001551","1364-6826","2007","1471-1484","Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics"

In fact, volcanic ash clouds pose a serious hazard for air traffic and the synoptic (and possibly frequent) coverage offered by satellites can provide exciting opportunities for monitoring activities as well as for risk mitigation purposes. A new, AVHRR-based technique for improved automatic detection of volcanic clouds by means of multi-temporal analysis of historical, long-term satellite records has been recently proposed. The technique basically rests on the Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT) approach, which is an innovative strategy of satellite data analysis, devoted to a former characterisation of the measured signal, in terms of expected value and natural variability and a further recognition of signal anomalies by an automatic, unsupervised change detection step. In this work, an extension of this method to nighttime observations is presented, by using thermal infrared information coming from AVHRR bands centred approximately at 3.5, 11.0 and 12.0 μm. Results achieved for two recent eruptive events of Mount Etna (occurred in May 2000 and in July 2001) seem to be encouraging, showing clear improvements in terms of ash detection sensitivity as well as in terms of false alarms reduction. The technique performance is also evaluated by comparison with the traditional “split-window” brightness temperature difference method; this exercise revealed a general improvement obtained by the proposed approach, even though some common problems still remain unsolved. The main merits of such an approach are its intrinsic self-adaptability to different environmental/natural/observational conditions and its natural exportability also to different satellite sensors. The results here presented show the benefits of such a technique especially when different observational conditions (time of pass, seasonal period, atmospheric moisture, solar illumination, volcanic cloud composition, satellite angles of view, etc.) are considered. The future prospects, also in terms of possible operational scenarios, coming from the implementation of such an approach on the new generation of satellite sensors (like, for example, SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation platform) are also discussed.","","article","","90","","","Improving volcanic ash cloud detection by a robust satellite technique","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442570300347X","0034-4257","2004","1-22","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Pseudogley soils are developed on gneisses from the Yaoundé Group. They have a dark brown to greyish brown color, with silty clay texture. Their mineral assemblage is made up of kaolinite, goethite, quartz, smectite, rutile, muscovite–illite and feldspars. The alluvial clastic sediments are characterized by variable colors (purple yellow, greenish, dark brown and purple brown) and sandy clay to clay texture. The mineral assemblage of alluvial clays is similar to that of pseudogley soils. SEM observations confirm the presence of kaolinite, smectite, quartz and muscovite–illite. Infrared data show that kaolinite is more orderly in pseudogley than in the alluvial clastic sediments. The Ngog-Lituba gneisses have moderate contents in SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O and several trace elements including REE. High element depletion is noticed in the pseudogley soils except Cr, V, Zr, Pb and REE. However, the alluvial clays are marked by a strong mobilization of LILE (Na, K, Ba, Rb and Sr) and REE, relative to the parent rock and pseudogley soils. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns are homogenous and parallel with Ce-anomalies. The (La/Yb)N shows that the REE fractionation increase from the parent rock to the alluvial clastic sediments. The mineralogical and geochemical features show that the clastic river sediments are derived from the erosion of the neighboring pseudogley materials before hydraulic sorting.","","article","","108","","","Mineralogy and geochemistry of pseudogley soils and recent alluvial clastic sediments in the Ngog-Lituba region, Southern Cameroon: An implication to their genesis","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1464343X15000795","1464-343X","2015","1-14","Journal of African Earth Sciences"

This paper uses Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the typical route networks and major ports of China's international liner shipping. On this basis, the changes in network efficiency and connectivity under the failure of important nodes is simulated. The research finds that, during the epidemic period, the scale of China's international liner shipping network increased, with more routes gathering at fewer hub ports. Still, the overall connectivity and connection strength declined. Meanwhile, the epidemic caused fluctuations in container volume and the mismatch of ship cargo capacity supply, in which China-U.S. routes was the most prominent. From the view of node, the competitiveness of China's mainland ports was significantly promoted during the epidemic. In addition, ports such as Busan, Singapore, and Hong Kong substantially impacted China's international liner shipping network.

To achieve this, several studies have been proposed to use labelled features but with the drawback of not being able to effectively extract the details of ship movement information. In addition, a ship movement is in a free space, which is different to a road vehicle’s movement in road grids, making it inconvenient to directly migrate the methods for GPS data classification into AIS data. To deal with these problems, a Convolutional Neural Network-Ship Movement Modes Classification (CNN-SMMC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The underlying concept of this method is to train a neural network to learn from the labelled AIS data, and the unlabelled AIS data can be effectively classified by using this trained network. More specifically, a Ship Movement Image Generation and Labelling (SMIGL) algorithm is first designed to convert a ship’s AIS trajectories into different movement images to make a full use of the CNN’s classification ability. Then, a CNN-SMMC architecture is built with a series of functional layers (convolutional layer, max-pooling layer, dense layer etc.) for ship movement classification with seven experiments been designed to find the optimal parameters for the CNN-SMMC. Considering the imbalanced features of AIS data, three metrics (average accuracy, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC)) are selected to evaluate the performance of the CNN-SMMC. Finally, several benchmark classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT)) are selected to compare with CNN-SMMC. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-SMMC has a better performance in the classification of AIS data.","","article","","218","","","A ship movement classification based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using Convolutional Neural Network","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801820311124","0029-8018","2020","108182","Ocean Engineering"

Forest disturbances occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales, with varying extent, severity, and persistence. To date, most of our understanding of detecting forest disturbances using remotely sensed imagery has been based on detecting abrupt and rapid, stand replacing disturbances, such as those related to wildfire and forest harvesting. Conversely, more continuous, subtle, and gradual non-stand replacing (NSR) disturbances, such as those related to drought stress or insect infestation have been subject to less focus. This can be attributed to the variability of NSR in space and time, as well as detection difficulties due to their often-subtle alterations to forest canopies and structure. Time series remote sensing techniques offer new opportunities for the capture and characterization of NSR disturbances. In this research, we investigate NSR disturbances as detected using a Landsat time series-based disturbance detection algorithm, Composite2Change (C2C) applied to the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada. We first examined three key characteristics of the spectral trajectory of NSR disturbances: pre-disturbance conditions, disturbance severity and disturbance persistence. From these characteristics, we defined seven typical NSR patterns (exemplars) for Canada’s forested ecosystems. Using annual information on predicted stand-level cover and biomass, we found that all NSR exemplars resulted in a loss of canopy cover, ranging from an average loss of between 5 and 31%. For instance, the most common exemplar was linked to a 15% reduction in canopy cover and a 13 Mg/ha reduction in biomass. While stands lost biomass, over the duration of the NSR, most stands increased slightly in stand height likely due to growth of the remaining trees or release from competition from the remaining stems. Comparing exemplars across Canada with independent data on NSR disturbance events confirmed that NSR exemplars that had larger severities, and shorter disturbance persistence times, were more commonly associated with insect infestations (e.g. mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)), whereas exemplars with a lower severity, and longer persistence were more commonly associated with drought events.

The availability of special observations offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore these events in depth and assess the capabilities of current numerical weather prediction tools. In this case, a small-scale secondary cyclone formed within a prominent cyclone that intensified in the north-western part of the western Mediterranean during IOP18 on October 31, 2012. The small secondary system formed near Catalonia, where heavy rain was observed, and then moved to the northern part of the island of Minorca, producing very strong winds. Finally, the secondary cyclone moved northeast while merging with the main cyclone and evolving as a cyclonic perturbation towards the Gulf of Genoa, bringing heavy precipitation to some Italian regions. This work aims at providing a detailed diagnosis of the genesis and evolution of the secondary cyclone, using high-resolution numerical tools. Furthermore, with the main objective of identifying the main physical mechanisms involved in the genesis and evolution of the small-scale secondary cyclone, sensitivity experiments were performed taking into account three main factors: latent heat release, upper-level dynamical forcing and topographical effects. Results show that in terms of individual cyclogenetic contributions, the upper level PV anomaly contribution dominated the initial phase and the diabatic heating from condensation contributed to the further deepening during the later stages of the secondary cyclone. The initial dynamical effect from the upper-levels forcing was amplified by the local topographic features, becoming a key synergistic factor for the formation of the damaging secondary cyclonic system.","","article","","242","","","Diagnosis of a high-impact secondary cyclone during HyMeX-SOP1 IOP18","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809519310877","0169-8095","2020","104983","Atmospheric Research"

This paper presents an analysis of navigational shipping accidents in the Northern Baltic Sea area which occurred in the period 2007–2013. The analysis is based on an integration of various data sources, aiming to reconstruct the accident conditions based on the best available data sources. Apart from basic accident information from the original accident databases, data from the Automatic Identification System is used to obtain insight in the operation type during which the accident occurred, as well as into other dynamic aspects of the accident scenario. Finally, atmospheric and sea ice data is used to reconstruct the navigational conditions under which the accidents occurred. The analysis aims to provide qualitative insights in patterns and outlier cases in the accidental conditions. Correspondingly, visual data mining is selected as analysis approach, because of its utility in obtaining qualitative knowledge from data sources through a combination of visualization techniques and human interaction with the data. Special attention is given to the strength of evidence of the identified accident patterns. The results are primarily useful for improving risk analyses focusing on oil spill risks in winter conditions and for developing realistic training scenarios for oil spill response operations.","","article","","92","","","An analysis of wintertime navigational accidents in the Northern Baltic Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753516302193","0925-7535","2017","66-84","Safety Science"

Backward trajectories, MERRA-2 AOD data, and CALIPSO images revealed the origin and synoptic meteorology conditions facilitating both trans-boundary pollution events. Anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions in continental East Asia fed the 2013 event, which was then transported by strong northeasterly winds triggered by an upper-level ridge near the Tibetan Plateau and a low-pressure system in western Pacific Ocean. In contrast, the 2015 event was the result of Indonesia biomass burning (BB), which was enhanced and transported by a westward propagating Western Pacific Subtropical High triggered by a strong El Niño event.

The disease is most prevalent in warm-moist coastal low-elevation environments causing mortality among seedlings and significant loss of incremental growth and branch death among mature trees. In this study we used a principle component regression model to spatially project the disease risk under observed climate (2003–2008) and multiple future climate scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. We found that while the majority of future climate scenarios predicted coastal environments will continue to favor occurrence of the disease, intensity is predicted to decrease toward the 2080s. Projected reductions of available summer climate moisture (cumulative precipitation – potential evapotranspiration), corresponding to the time of ascospore discharge and germination, contribute significantly to this finding. Disease intensity is however, projected to increase under moderate temperature and precipitation increases for the 2020s. We therefore recommend current reforestation efforts deploy disease resistant western redcedar seedlots in high risk environments common to hypermaritime coastal regions such as Haida Gwaii and northern maritime, to avoid significant mortality and growth reduction.","","article","","180","","","Predicting the risk of cedar leaf blight (Didymascella thujina) in British Columbia under future climate change","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192313001007","0168-1923","2013","152-163","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

In addition, ERA-Interim reanalysis data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were used to present related environmental characteristics. It was found that the response of lightning flash to ENSO events shows remarkable seasonal and regional variations. The regions of positive (negative) lightning anomaly are mainly located at both sides of 5°–20°N (5°–15°N) in El Niño (La Niña) spring and winter, and located north of the equator in summer and autumn. There is a significantly positive correlation between lightning anomaly and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) over both East China and Indonesia during El Niño episodes, but no obvious correlation during La Niña episodes. The positive thunderstorm anomalies during El Niño periods are dispersed. The distribution of thunderstorm anomalies in La Niña summer and autumn is almost opposite to that in spring and winter. The correlation between thunderstorm anomaly and ONI is better over East China than that over Indonesia. In general, lightning variation follows thunderstorm intensity (number) variation over East China during El Niño (La Niña) episodes, and follows a combination of thunderstorm intensity and number variations over Indonesia on ENSO time scales. During ENSO time scales, variations of surface wind can be considered as one of the key factors to LAs. More lightning flashes present in the regions where warm moist flows intersection, and less in the regions where surface wind changes slightly or diverges. Dramatic lightning increases also occur with higher values of convective available potential energy (CAPE). In addition, higher (lower) 850hPa relative humidity generally follows with more (less) lightning flashes, which is more obvious during El Niño episodes.","","article","","169","","","Variability of lightning flash and thunderstorm over East/Southeast Asia on the ENSO time scales","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809515003439","0169-8095","2016","377-390","Atmospheric Research"

The problem of acquiring data of an underlying environment that usually changes within time involves a proper formulation of the information. The use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles equipped with water quality sensor modules can serve as an early-warning system for contamination peak-detection, algae blooms monitoring, or oil-spill scenarios. In addition to information gathering, the vehicle must plan routes that are free of obstacles on non-convex static and dynamics maps. This work proposes a novel framework to obtain a collision-free policy using deterministic knowledge of the environment by means of a censoring operator and noisy networks that addresses the informative path planning with emphasis in temporal patrolling.

In addition to sea urchins, sea cucumbers have recently been implemented in embryotoxicity bioassays showing high potential in ecotoxicological studies. However, the use of this species is still hindered by a lack of knowledge regarding their comparative responsiveness. The present study aimed to investigate the responsiveness of different echinoderm species to environmental pollution in order to develop their integration in batteries of ecotoxicological bioassays. To this end, the embryos of two sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula) and two sea cucumbers (Holothuria polii and Holothuria tubulosa) were incubated with inorganic and organic toxicants (cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, sodium dodecyl sulphate and 4-n-Nonhyphenol) and elutriates from contaminated marine sediments, chosen as a case study model. The results obtained, expressed through the percentage of abnormal embryos and Integrative Toxicity Indices (ITI), indicated species-specific sensitivities to pollutants, with comparable and correlated responsiveness between sea urchins and sea cucumbers. More specifically, sea cucumber larvae exposed to elutriates appear to be more sensitive than sea urchins, especially when incubated with samples containing trace metals, PCB and TBT. These results indicate that toxic responses in embryos exposed to environmental matrices are probably modulated by interactions between different variables, including additive, synergistic and antagonistic effects. These findings suggest that performing a larval test using different echinoderm classes can integrate the interactive effects of bioavailable fraction of contaminants on various levels, providing sensitive, representative and all year-round batteries of bioassays to apply in ecotoxicological studies.","","article","","335","","","Echinoderm larvae as bioindicators for the assessment of marine pollution: Sea urchin and sea cucumber responsiveness and future perspectives","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123012873","0269-7491","2023","122285","Environmental Pollution"

Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radiometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncertainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter-band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration.","","article","","282","","","Monitoring of high biomass Phaeocystis globosa blooms in the Southern North Sea by in situ and future spaceborne hyperspectral radiometry","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722003765","0034-4257","2022","113270","Remote Sensing of Environment"

This approach addresses the issue that the conventional INS and shipborne GNSS integrated navigation scheme can utilize the three-dimensional position information only, without considering the measurement update from the one-dimensional speed obtained by shipborne GNSS. The algorithm is verified by actual ship departure and cruising experiments in natural marine environments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher accuracy than the conventional algorithm when the GNSS speed and position information are available.

The annual rainfall, the extreme rain index of R95p (number of very wet days), and R99p (number of very extremely wet days) show a slightly decreasing trend. However, the index of consecutive wet days (CWD) increases, resembling the rising number of floods and landslides. Rainfall shows robust seasonal and diurnal variations. Peak rainfall occurs in November–December and March–April, while the driest period is observed during August–October. Dry months associated with El-Nino, can cause severe dry conditions and increase the potential for catastrophic forest fires. The peak precipitation amount and frequency were observed in the early morning and the second peak in the afternoon. Mainland areas tend to have a peak occurring later than those on the coast and ocean.

Because of the lack of specific research on spatial point events, this study presents an adaptive approach for spatial point events outlier detection (SPEOD) using multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation. First, the spatial proximity relationships between spatial point events are roughly captured by Delaunay triangulation. Then, three-level constraints are described and used to refine spatial proximity relationships with the consideration of statistical characteristics. Finally, those spatial point events connected by remaining edges are gathered to form a series of subgraphs. Those subgraphs containing very few point events are regarded as spatial outliers. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world spatial data sets are used to show that the proposed SPEOD algorithm can detect various types of spatial point event outliers with high efficiency. Moreover, there is no need to input any parameter in SPEOD.","","article","","59","","","Adaptive detection of spatial point event outliers using multilevel constrained Delaunay triangulation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516300783","0198-9715","2016","164-183","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems"

Algorithm validation was performed with a Circum-Arctic network of station measurements extracted from the Global Surface Summary of Day product maintained by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Estimates of melt onset date corresponded to a clear shift in the statistical distribution of mean daily air temperatures from largely below freezing to above freezing.

QSCAT- derived melt end dates were significantly correlated with station-derived snow-off estimates (r2 = 0.79; RMSE = 11.6 days). The difference between the two estimates was within one week for 70% of the cases so there is good potential to use QSCAT-derived melt end dates to approximate snow-off dates across the pan-Arctic region.

Our results show that the amount of noise in AIS data depends on factors such as the equipment used, external factors, humans, dense traffic etc. The contribution that our paper makes is in combining and making a comprehensive list of both the promises and perils of AIS data.

Existing methods relying on a model-informed expert judgment of ship-ship collision risk are of limited practical use because periodic risk monitoring is feasible only when this can be done without extensive use of organizational resources. To alleviate such limitations, this article presents a new approach based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition to interpret and classify ship-ship collision risks in encounter scenarios. The specific aim of the article is to investigate whether a CNN-based model can quickly and accurately interpret images constructed based on data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in terms of collision risk. To test this, estimates derived from training data are compared to validation data. It is also investigated whether adding additional navigational information based on AIS data improves the model's predictive accuracy. A case study with data from the Baltic Sea area is implemented, where various model design alternatives are tested as a proof-of-concept. The main finding of this work is that a CNN-based approach can indeed meet the specified design requirements, suggesting that this is a fruitful direction for future work.

Data from MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2 covering 34months from September 2008 to July 2011 are examined for a study region consisting of Indonesia, Malaysia, and nearby environs. The spatial and temporal distributions of fires detected in the MTSAT WF_ABBA product are described and compared with active fire observations from MODIS MOD14 data. Land cover distributions for the two instruments are examined using a new 250m land cover product from the National University of Singapore. The two products show broadly similar patterns of fire activity, land cover distribution of fires, and pixel fire radiative power (FRP). However, the MTSAT WF_ABBA data differ from MOD14 in important ways. Relative to MODIS, the MTSAT WF_ABBA product has lower overall detection efficiency, but more fires detected due to more frequent looks, a greater relative fraction of fires in forest and a lower relative fraction of fires in open areas, and significantly higher single-pixel retrieved FRP. The differences in land cover distribution and FRP between the MTSAT and MODIS products are shown to be qualitatively consistent with expectations based on pixel size and diurnal sampling. The MTSAT WF_ABBA data are used to calculate coverage-corrected diurnal cycles of fire for different regions within the study area. These diurnal cycles are preliminary but demonstrate that the fraction of diurnal fire activity sampled by the two MODIS sensors varies significantly by region and vegetation type. Based on the results from comparison of the two fire products, a series of steps is outlined to account for some of the systematic biases in each of these satellite products in order to produce a successful merged fire detection product.","","article","","122","","","Patterns of fire activity over Indonesia and Malaysia from polar and geostationary satellite observations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016980951200186X","0169-8095","2013","504-519","Atmospheric Research"

However, due to the complex and dynamic ocean environment, marine sensors could be captured by malicious attackers and then become Byzantine sensors. Byzantine sensors may tamper with the actual sensor data at a fixed or time-varying probability and transmit it to the data fusion center (DFC), which renders the normal localization and tracking function of the search and rescue system downgrade or even fail. To address this issue, we develop a New robust marine mobile Multi-Target LocAlization and Tracking scheme called NMTLAT by eliminating abnormal measurement data from the initial measurement data. NMTLAT works in several steps. By analyzing and mining sensors data and behavior, we firstly employ the information entropy of the system composed of a single sensor and their neighbor sensors to develop an efficient dynamic threshold based Byzantine node identification method. After migrating Byzantine sensors, the DFC utilizes sensor-aware and preprocessed marine data of the beacon or honest sensors to complete target localization and trajectory tracking. Specifically, NMTLAT consists of a novel distributed and cooperative multi-target localization and tracking algorithm using both received signal strength indication (RSSI) and priori information of sensors location. NMTLAT employs the importance sampling method to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the sensors and targets location. Furthermore, when the marine target is outside MSR-WSNs coverage, a piecewise function is utilized to characterize the likelihood of finding a drowning target in the search and rescue sea area. Finally, the Lyapunov’s second stability theorem is adopted to measure the stability of the NMTLAT. Our extensive simulation experiments validate that the NMTLAT performance is superior to existing solutions in various marine search and rescue scenarios.","","article","","160","","","NMTLAT: A New robust mobile Multi-Target Localization and Tracking Scheme in marine search and rescue wireless sensor networks under Byzantine attack","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366420301900","0140-3664","2020","623-635","Computer Communications"

In this study, we investigated the variations on aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm over the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea during the COVID-19 lockdown (from February to March in 2020) of China mainland based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observation by comparing with historical AOD records (2011–2019). Our results show that with the lockdown implementation, the decade-low AOD levels are achieved in February and March 2020 (0.39 ± 0.18 and 0.37 ± 0.19, respectively), which are 22% and 28% (p < 0.01) lower than the average AOD between 2011 and 2019 (0.50 ± 0.08 and 0.52 ± 0.05, respectively). After the lockdown restrictions were relaxed and industrial production gradually resumed, the AOD in April 2020 rebounded to the historical average level. Besides, compared with historical observations (2011–2019), the AOD temporal variability from February to April 2020 showed different pattern, with the decade-high increase from March to April (+0.11) and decade-low increase from February to March (-0.01). Independent observations and simulation, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from ground-based measurements, wind field from Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform, satellite-derived aerosol type, and back trajectories calculation by Hybird Single Paricle Lagrangian Intergrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, indicated that the above abnormal AOD variation can be attributed to reduction of anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The results of this paper, therefore, indicate that aerosols over the Bohai and Yellow Seas are strongly influenced by human activities, and the public health events such as the epidemic may alter the intensity of human activities and thus the spatio-temporal pattern of aerosol over ocean. With the global spread of the epidemic and the corresponding significant changes in human behavior patterns (restrictions on human activities, etc.), more studies should be carried out in the future about the aerosol variability and its potential impact on the marine environment.","","article","","112","","","Decade-low aerosol levels over the Bohai and Yellow Seas amid the COVID-19 lockdown","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843222001078","1569-8432","2022","102905","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation"

The main island, Grande Terre, is surrounded by a barrier reef of 1100km length enclosing a large lagoon of 24,000km2 and up to 60m deep. The complexity of the maritime environment is controlled by both the westward South Equatorial Current and the border currents induced by its deflection against the islands. The climate is driven by the South Pacific Convergence Zone and fluctuates with ENSO events. Although rare, cyclones are a significant climatic risk in the country. Shallow coastal habitats consist of rich and diverse coral reef habitats and associated ecosystems including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and lagoonal soft bottoms which house tens of thousands of species. New Caledonia has low population densities (15km−2) and small urbanized areas. Most of the people live on the coast with two-thirds in the Greater Nouméa area. Despite the relatively low anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems, the development of mining industries is driving a range of environmental impacts and their associated ecological consequences. Subsidence fishing and agricultural activities are traditionally important for rural people. However, practices have changed considerably with the development of recreational fishing and with offshore fisheries with industrial long-lining. After attempts at seafood aquaculture (shrimps, oysters), a recent diversification is toward high-value marine resources (sea cucumber, microalgae).

Numerous regulations have been enacted for protection and conservation of marine species, areas, and habitats under the responsibility of provincial and government authorities. Two significant steps have been taken with the inscription in the World Heritage listing of half of the reefs and lagoonal areas and the creation of the Coral Sea Natural Park that represents 78% of France’s MPAs.

We applied a temporal change classification of 37GHz brightness temperature (Tb) series from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) to classify daily FT status over global land areas where seasonal frozen temperatures influence ecosystem processes. A temporally consistent, long-term (30year) FT record was created, ensuring cross-sensor consistency through pixel-wise adjustment of the SMMR Tb record based on empirical analyses of overlapping SMMR and SSM/I measurements. The resulting FT record showed mean annual spatial classification accuracies of 91 (+/−8.6) and 84 (+/−9.3) percent for PM and AM overpass retrievals relative to in situ air temperature measurements from the global weather station network. The FT results were compared against other measures of biosphere activity including CO2 eddy flux tower measurements and satellite (MODIS) vegetation greenness (NDVI). The FT defined non-frozen season largely bounds the period of active vegetation growth and net ecosystem CO2 uptake for tower sites representing major biomes. Earlier spring thawing and longer non-frozen seasons generally benefit vegetation growth inferred from NDVI spring and summer growth anomalies where the non-frozen season is less than approximately 6months, with greater benefits at higher (>45°N) latitudes. A strong (P<0.001) increasing (0.189daysyr−1) trend in the Northern Hemisphere mean annual non-frozen season is largely driven by an earlier (−0.149daysyr−1) spring thaw trend and coincides with a 0.033°Cyr−1 regional warming trend. The FT record also shows a positive (0.199daysyr−1) trend in the number of transitional (AM frozen and PM non-frozen) frost days, which coincide with reduced vegetation productivity inferred from tower CO2 and MODIS NDVI measurements. The relative benefits of earlier and longer non-frozen seasons for vegetation growth under global warming may be declining due to opposing increases in disturbance, drought and frost damage related impacts.","","article","","121","","","Satellite detection of increasing Northern Hemisphere non-frozen seasons from 1979 to 2008: Implications for regional vegetation growth","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425712001071","0034-4257","2012","472-487","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Compared to the other two pioneering methods, building the model from data-driven learning seems to be a more appropriate way for ever-larger vessels that entered service in recent years. However, owing to insufficient speed-related features that can be known in advance, such as the engine state and propeller propulsion, traditional data-driven models usually have poor generalization ability when facing new test data. In this paper, taking a case study of a 400,000 DWT ore carrier sailing between China and Brazil, we first provide comparisons of several widely-used data-driven models and select the framework of random forest as the basic.

Of particular relevance, negative anomalies of snow and sea ice cover, glacier retreat, and the extended melt of Greenland combined with increasing temperature at double the rate of the rest of the planet have been observed in the Arctic. Several studies have suggested that another response to the current arctic warming could be an increase in rain-on-snow (ROS) events followed by subsequent freezing and the creation of ice layers. We use recently developed detection algorithms of ROS and ice events using passive microwave retrieval approaches to examine the spatial and temporal trends in rain-on-snow and ice layer creation for 18 islands across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) over the last two decades. Results show that both icing and ROS event occurrence tripled between the periods of 1979–1995 and 1996–2011, with very active years in winters 1993–1994, 1998–1999 and 2002–2003. The areas with the most combined occurrences are the Boothia Peninsula and Axel Heiberg, Cornwallis, Banks and Victoria Islands. We then compare the rain-on-snow and icing events to Peary caribou estimates to test whether the algorithms can detect weather events associated with population declines. There has been an important reduction in population numbers of Peary caribou, the northernmost caribou population in Canada, over the last three generations. The major hypothesis for the decline is that severe weather events lead to more difficult winter grazing conditions. The comparison with the Peary caribou population estimates suggest that caribou numbers decrease with increased occurrence of ROS and icing events, where 3–4 ROS events and 1–2 icing events in one winter season are sufficient to have a negative impact on Peary caribou.","","article","","189","","","Detection of rain-on-snow (ROS) events and ice layer formation using passive microwave radiometry: A context for Peary caribou habitat in the Canadian Arctic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425716304370","0034-4257","2017","84-95","Remote Sensing of Environment"

With the wide use of automatic identification systems (AISs), which allow ships to receive identification/location information from nearby ships, it is feasible to classify the types of ships by analysing ship behaviour from AIS-based trajectories. However, the imbalanced features of AIS data make it difficult to achieve satisfactory classification results in the presence of several different types of ships. To overcome these potential limitations, we propose a multi-view feature fusion network (MVFFNet) to achieve accurate ship classification with imbalanced data. To guarantee the powerful representation and generalization abilities of MVFFNet, we first extract several multi-view features (i.e., motion features and morphological features) from AIS-based ship trajectories. Several kinematic variables related to ship behaviour are empirically adopted as motion features. The morphological features are automatically extracted via convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) networks. CAE networks are capable of optimally learning the features from informative trajectory images, which are strictly related to the original ship trajectories. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) network is then proposed to combine multi-view features to generate the ship classification results. In addition, a hybrid loss function is presented to handle the imbalance problem of ship types, potentially leading to enhanced robustness and accuracy of ship classification. Comprehensive experiments on two realistic datasets have demonstrated that our proposed MVFFNet consistently outperforms other competing methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.","","article","","151","","","MVFFNet: Multi-view feature fusion network for imbalanced ship classification","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865521002737","0167-8655","2021","26-32","Pattern Recognition Letters"

TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 106 km2 ± 0.5 × 106 km2). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.","","article","","260","","","Detection of signals linked to climate change, land-cover change and climate oscillators in Tropical Montane Cloud Forests","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425721001498","0034-4257","2021","112431","Remote Sensing of Environment"

In recent years, the exposed dry lake bottom surface has become a remarkable source of salt and dust owing to the desiccation of the lake. Given the importance of the lake basin to human livelihoods, comprehensive monitoring of basin behavior is required. Remote sensing offers numerous novel approaches to monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols. During this study, high spatial resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) inversion at Lake Ebinur was still in the gap stage. The wide-field-of-view (WFV) data from four cameras on the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite, launched by China in April 2013, offers high spatial and temporal resolution and excellent potential for AOD estimation. Owing to the shortwave infrared band (SWIR) deficiency and the complexity of surface reflectance, the coefficient of variation (CV) was proposed as a measure of surface reflectance to develop a surface reflectance database for land cover characteristics in the Ebinur Lake Basin. The significant improvements of the algorithm include (1) the design of an accurate and universal cloud detection algorithm through the blue and red bands. (2) The CV was used to assess the robustness of surface reflectance under long time series. After dividing the surface reflectance image pixels with low robustness, a reasonable value was assigned according to the surface reflectance variation characteristics of the image pixels.

Tracking close contacts remains an effective way to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Therefore, indoor positioning technology should be developed for ship environments. Today, almost all smart devices are equipped with Bluetooth. The Angle of Arrival (AoA) using Bluetooth 5.1 indoor positioning technology is well suited for ship environments. But the narrow ship space and steel walls make the multipath effect more pronounced in ship environments. This also means that more noises are included in the signal. In the Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) type receiving antenna array, elevation and azimuth angles are two important parameters for the AoA indoor positioning technology. Elevation and azimuth angles are unstable because of the influence of noise. In this paper, a Self-Learning Mean Optimization Filter (SLMOF) is proposed. The goal of SLMOF is to find the optimal elevation and azimuth angles as a way to improve the Bluetooth 5.1 AoA indoor positioning accuracy. The experimental results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of SLMOF is 0.44 m, which improves the accuracy by 72% compared to Kalman Filter (KF).

Three short-duration precipitation types, including all events and the events in the 75th and 95th percentiles, are defined. At the 75th percentile, both the amount and number of TC-induced extreme short-duration rainfall events exhibit slightly declining trends, and the trends are not pronounced for the 95th-percentile cases. The number and amount of TC-induced 95th-percentile events are approximately one order of magnitude larger than those of the 75th-percentile cases, indicating that TCs play a more significant role on the upper tail of the rainfall distribution over the MLYRV in summer than on the rest of the precipitation distribution. A large number of the defined non-TC precipitation events are mainly distributed over the central-south MLYRV and southeastern regions. The spatial patterns of TC-induced rainfall resemble the contributions of TC-induced precipitation events to the total summer rainfall, with large values located in southeastern regions of the MLYRV. The spatial distribution of 95th-percentile events is principally attributed to the frequency of TC activities and to the TC tracks. Most of the TCs that trigger 95th-percentile events make landfall over the southeast MLYRV, and the corresponding large frequency of TC tracks is mainly situated over the ocean to the east of Taiwan. Both environmental factors and atmospheric circulations modulate the variations in extreme short-duration rainfall events. In particular, equatorward displacement of the western Pacific subtropical high impacts TC track density, resulting in more occurrences of precipitation extremes in 95th-percentile events over the MLYRV.","","article","","282","","","Impacts of tropical cyclones on summertime short-duration precipitation extremes over the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809522005063","0169-8095","2023","106520","Atmospheric Research"

After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (RRS) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS RRS anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002–2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed RRS anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM RRS anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms.

The clustering results reflect the characteristics of different vessel traffic behaviours, which can assist authorities in transportation management. However, there are two drawbacks to traditional clustering analysis. First, the similarity measures among different trajectories in a clustering analysis mainly focus on spatial differentiation and frequently do not consider motion features, such as speed and course. Second, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a famous clustering analysis method, is characterized by poor self-adaption, which means that it cannot autonomously determine the best parameters based on different sample sets. These issues limit the efficiency of clustering analysis. To address these problems, a new similarity measure using statistical methods and based on multi-attribute trajectory characteristics is proposed to reflect the similarity among different trajectories. The proposed measure considers the spatial and motion features of trajectories. Furthermore, the Parzen window (a non-parametric estimation method) and the multivariate Gaussian distribution are employed to generate self-adaptive strategies to determine the optimal parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm for a given sample set. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and improved DBSCAN algorithm.

Compared with traditional walk-through thermography, it is much quicker and cheaper to perform. Yet it is currently unclear how successful this methodology is at detecting building defects. This paper qualitatively compares pass-by thermography and walk-through thermography. A set of 122 residential dwellings in South West England was inspected using the both methodologies. Results show that substantially more defects were detected using walk-through thermography, with internal inspections yielding the greatest number of detected defects. Significant constraints with walk-past thermography were identified, such as unknown occupancy behaviour, transient climatic conditions, fixed viewing angles and spatial resolution limitations, which were all found to have a greater impact on image results than during walk-through thermography.

This bridge has many structural components, and our work focuses on a subset of 800 jack arches under the traffic lane 7. Our goal is to identify which of these jack arches (if any) respond differently to the traffic input, due to potential structural damages or instrumentation issues. We propose a novel non-model-based method to achieve this objective, using a spectrum-driven feature based on the Spectral Moments (SMs) from measured responses from the jack arches. SMs contain information from the entire frequency range, thus subtle differences between the normal signals and distorted ones could be identified. Our method then applies a modified k-means−− clustering algorithm to these features, followed by a selection mechanism on the clustering results to identify jack arches with abnormal responses. We performed an extensive evaluation of the proposed method using real data from the bridge. This evaluation included a control component, where the approach successfully detected jack arches with already known damage or issues. It also included a test component, which applied the method to a large set of nodes over a month of data to detect any potential anomaly. The detected anomalies turned out to have indeed system issues after further investigations.","","article","","87","","","A spectral-based clustering for structural health monitoring of the Sydney Harbour Bridge","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327016304538","0888-3270","2017","384-400","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing"

Clustering of stations with high co-occurrence of simultaneous HW days is employed to identify regional HW events over five homogeneous regions: northern, central-eastern and southern SSA regions, central Argentina, and central Chile. When all regions are considered, we find a mean frequency of ∼4 HWs per year. Transitional regions (northern SSA, central-eastern SSA and central Argentina) are characterised by longer, albeit less intense, HWs than the southernmost region (southern SSA), whereas central Chile events display the lowest duration, intensity and extension. By aggregating these single HW attributes into a combined severity index, a ranking of historical HWs has been obtained, with the March 1980 event standing as the most severe one of SSA. The assessment of long-term changes reveals significant increases in the frequency of regional HW days over central Argentina and central Chile only. Trends in HW characteristics are also region dependent, and the southernmost region is the only one where HW severity has increased significantly. We report similarities and differences in the synoptic circulation patterns associated with regional HW events. Southern SSA HWs have the most distinctive signatures, related to extratropical high-pressure systems blocking the westerly flow. In the remaining regions, HWs are associated with anomalies in the South Atlantic (northern SSA, central-eastern SSA and central Argentina) or South Pacific (central Chile) High, and the intensification of the northerly low-level flow by regional thermal lows and South American Low Level Jet events. Regional HWs often migrate from northern to central-eastern SSA and central Argentina, following the displacement/intensification of the South Atlantic High, which partially explains the similarity of their associated patterns.","","article","","40","","","Regionalisation of heat waves in southern South America","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094723000221","2212-0947","2023","100569","Weather and Climate Extremes"

Nevertheless, they also brought with them new challenges. The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models demand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready datasets by merging existing and procedural data. SyntEO does this by including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic datasets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated dataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging environments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated, demonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset structure and influence the training process. SyntEO is thus a hybrid approach that creates an interface between expert knowledge and data-driven image analysis.","","article","","189","","","SyntEO: Synthetic dataset generation for earth observation and deep learning – Demonstrated for offshore wind farm detection","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271622001319","0924-2716","2022","163-184","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing"

There are different sources for HCHO in the atmosphere, in which fuel combustion and biomass burning are predominant. The oxidation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and methane are the chemical production pathways of HCHO in the troposphere. Here, we show a different source of HCHO emission to the atmosphere; the maritime shipping. The analyses using satellite measurements for the period 2005–2014 reveal large amounts of HCHO release along the ship routes in Indian Ocean, about 7–8 x1015 molec./cm2. This is nearly twice (150–200%) the ambient or background HCHO levels (about 4 × 1015 molec./cm2), when there is no ship emissions in the north Indian Ocean. The trend in HCHO concentrations over the Indian Ocean sea routes is about 0.008 × 1015 molec./cm2/year. The amount and the increasing trends of HCHO over the maritime routes in the north Indian Ocean are also comparable to those of the busiest sea-lanes in the world Oceans, such as the Panama Canal, Mediterranean Sea and Strait of Malacca. Our analyses, henceforth, suggest use of a better fuel for shipping to reduce the maritime pollution, as the polluted air can often be transported to the coastal regions and islands, which is a concern for public health in those regions.","","article","","246","","","A decade of satellite observations reveal significant increase in atmospheric formaldehyde from shipping in Indian Ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135223102030827X","1352-2310","2021","118095","Atmospheric Environment"

The combination of 222Rn with information on wind direction and carbon monoxide (CO) permitted a classification of air masses into continental, marine, and mixtures of both. The ability to select trace gas data representing purely maritime conditions is shown through application to carbon dioxide (CO2) data. 222Rn levels at Cape Point ranged from near zero to above 5000mBqm−3. Monthly percentiles show practically no seasonal dependence for values up to the 25th percentile (P25), corresponding to 222Rn <100mBqm−3, which is considered typical for marine air. In contrast, 222Rn percentiles exceeding P50 reveal an austral winter maximum, related to a higher incidence of continental air at that time of the year. The wind sector pattern for 222Rn concentrations largely coincides with that observed for CO, but covers a wider sector to the east, reflecting continental source areas. Air masses with 222Rn levels between 100 and 250mBqm−3 were found to be still affected by terrestrial sources. Our routinely used percentile-based statistical filter applied to CO2 accepted <75% of the data compared to the radon criterion for maritime air (222Rn <100mBqm−3), which only yielded 18%, but is more stringent in excluding terrestrial influences. CO2 data filtered by using a combination of various selection parameters agreed well with data obtained for 222Rn <100mBqm−3, confirming that this 222Rn threshold is a suitable criterion for purely maritime data. Nonetheless, for CO2 the statistical filter, which does not depend on other species and has better data coverage, still retains its applicability for routine trace gas filtering with respect to baseline concentrations.","","article","","38","","","Baseline air mass selection at Cape Point, South Africa: application of 222Rn and other filter criteria to CO2","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231004004261","1352-2310","2004","5693-5702","Atmospheric Environment"

An Avoidance Behavior-based Collision Detection Model (ABCD-M) is introduced to identify potential collision scenarios and Collision Risk Indices (CRIs) are quantified when evasive actions are taken for each detected collision scenario in various voyages. The method is applied on Ro-Pax ships operating over 13 months of the ice-free period in the Gulf of Finland. Results indicate that collision risk estimates may be extremely diverse among voyages, and in 97.5% of potential collision scenarios the evasive actions are triggered only when risk is at 45% or more of its maximum value. The overall CRI for ships operating over the given area tends to be lower for adverse hydro-meteorological conditions. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may assist with the (1) identification of critical scenarios in various voyages not currently accounted for by existing accident databases, (2) definition of commonly agreed risk criteria to set off alarms, (3) the estimation of risk profile over the life cycle of fleet operations.","","article","","213","","","A Big Data Analytics Method for the Evaluation of Ship - Ship Collision Risk reflecting Hydrometeorological Conditions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202100212X","0951-8320","2021","107674","Reliability Engineering & System Safety"

IIoT brings together new emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML), that contribute to new applications, industrial processes and efficiency management in factories. This combination of new technologies and contexts is paired with Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) to reduce costs through the virtualisation of networks and services. As these new paradigms increase in growth, so does the number of threats and vulnerabilities, making IIoT a very desirable target for cybercriminals. In addition, IIoT devices have certain intrinsic limitations, especially due to their limited resources, and this makes it impossible, in many cases, to detect attacks by using solutions designed for other paradigms. So it is necessary to design, implement and evaluate new solutions or adapt existing ones. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent threat detector based on boosted tree algorithms. Such detectors have been implemented and evaluated in an environment specifically designed to test IIoT deployments. In this way, we can learn how these algorithms, which have been successful in multiple contexts, behave in a paradigm with known constraints.

In the context of anthropogenic climate change, the authors investigated the anthropogenic impacts on the occurrence of extreme drought like that in 2019 (2019Drought-like event) and the related physical mechanism. The authors first selected relatively better-performing models by evaluating their historical simulations, and found that the occurrence probability of a 2019Drought-like event increased by eight times due to anthropogenic forcing. It seems that anthropogenic forcing induces background mean state changes over EC, including a decline in mean moisture content and enhanced mean descending motion. These two mean state changes are favorable for the formation of extreme drought. Diagnosis of the moisture budget showed that the decline in mean moisture mainly stems from the enhanced mean descending motion via the term −δω¯·∂q¯∂p (vertical advection of mean moisture by the change in mean vertical motion). The enhanced descent is linked to the anthropogenic forcing–induced mean sea surface temperature warming pattern, which exhibits a maximum near the equatorial region. This reinforces the mean ascending motion over the Maritime Continent, as in “the rich-get-richer” mechanism, and further causes strengthened subsidence over the EC region through a “regional Hadley circulation”. This study suggests that anthropogenic forcing can sharply increase the occurrence probability of a 2019Drought-like event by modulating large-scale circulations. 摘要 2019年夏秋季中国东部遭遇了七十年一遇的强持续性极端干旱事件. 本文借助于CMIP6检测归因模式比较计划 (DAMIP) 数据, 量化了人为强迫对类似2019年极端干旱事件发生概率的影响. 通过比较不同外强迫因子作用下此类极端干旱事件的发生概率, 发现人为强迫可使此类极端干旱事件的发生概率提高8倍左右. 进一步研究发现人为强迫引起的海表温度增暖是经向不均匀的, 对应海洋大陆附近存在一个增暖大值中心, 从而增强海洋大陆地区平均上升环流, 通过局地Hadley环流作用导致中国东部地区平均垂直环流出现异常下沉, 最终有利于中国东部极端干旱事件发生概率增加. 该研究表明, 人为强迫通过调制气候平均背景场从而引起极端事件发生频次的变化是人类活动影响极端气候事件的重要途径之一.","","article","","16","","","Anthropogenic influence on the occurrence of extreme drought like that in eastern China in 2019","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674283422001799","1674-2834","2023","100296","Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters"

To address this limitation, we investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms to quantify the relative likelihood of an incident during the US Atlantic hurricane season. By training an algorithm on vessel traffic, weather and historical casualty data, accident candidates can be identified from historic vessel tracks. Amongst the various methods tested, Support Vector Machines showed good performance with Recall at 95% and Accuracy reaching 92%.

An U.A.V. (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle (from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method, while the thermal infrared (TIR) images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures. The obtained 3D model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays. The analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are (1) not correlated to surface properties, and (2) spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions. Using a 2D conductive-radiative model, we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air-filled area. Finally, we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro-fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones.","","article","","587","","","Permeability and voids influence on the thermal signal, as inferred by multitemporal UAV-based infrared and visible images","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216942030367X","0022-1694","2020","124907","Journal of Hydrology"

The study period covers the months from April to December of the 6 years from 2014 to 2019. Observations are reported with a horizontal resolution of 1 km and a vertical resolution of 0.1 km in terms of density of VHF sources emitted by lightning, and of number of lightning day, in plane- and vertical- projections. Vertical distributions of VHF sources are also provided monthly for the whole period and over the full domain. These 3D long term observations show that the number of lightning days is more important on the main relief of the island. The density of VHF sources exhibits a sharp maximum over the confluence area of the 3 main valleys in the center of the northern part of the island, characterized by a recurrent and vertically well developed lightning activity. The period from 11:00 UTC to 14:00 UTC in July, and in a lesser extent in June and August, is at the origin of this density maximum. This behavior is thus due to a diurnal convection. The whole lightning activity is characterized by 2 maxima in June and September. The first one is linked with the diurnal convection in phase with the maximum elevation of the Sun. The second one must be due to usual large-scale organized thunderstorm events of the fall season. The vertical distribution of VHF sources exhibits an increase in the number of VHF sources from April to August at all altitudes, as well as an increase in the altitude of the main upper peak (from 5.8 km to 10 km) and of the secondary lower peak (from 4.2 km to 6.7 km) of this distribution. From August to December, the opposite evolution appears, except that October is characterized by a strong anomaly with a single intense lower peak at 5.5 km, apparently due to 2 strong events corresponding to anomalously electrified thunderstorms. Several of these anomalously electrified thunderstorms (negative dipoles) are reported. They are all characterized by the movement of cloud cells spatially small and relatively undeveloped vertically propagating from southwest to northeast and associated with a strong transport of desert dust from the African continent. The analysis of the meteorological environment of some of the studied events allows concluding that in each of the studied cases elevated convection was triggered, above the relatively dry atmospheric boundary layer characterized by a strong convective inhibition. The low cloud liquid water content which is a key parameter of the non-inductive charging process is probably a good candidate to explain the anomalous electrification of these events.","","article","","275","","","Six years of electrified convection over the island of Corsica monitored by SAETTA: General trends and anomalously electrified thunderstorms during African dust south flow events","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809522002137","0169-8095","2022","106227","Atmospheric Research"

The exploration and inspection activities of the underwater environment are mainly performed remotely by unmanned underwater vehicles or robots because human direct involvement in such a complex environment might not be a feasible option. Moreover, the recent maturity in digital automation and underwater drone technology along with the emergence and improvements in wireless, communication, and sensing technologies had already encouraged the research community to drive deep into this domain.

However, this increase has not been temporally or spatially uniform, with variations observed depending both on the period considered and the geographic region. In this context, this paper aims to quantify relevant changes in SST along the Western Iberian Coast over the last four decades, through the calculation of trends and anomalies of long-term time series of in situ observations and satellite-derived data. Potential drivers of SST changes were considered using atmospheric and teleconnections time series. Changes in the seasonal cycle of SST were also evaluated. We show that SST has increased since 1982, with regional variations between 0.10 and 0.25 °C per decade, with an increase in air temperature appearing to drive the SST trends along the Iberian coast. In the near-shore area, no significant trends or changes in the seasonal cycle of SST were observed, which is likely due to a buffer effect caused by the seasonal upwelling that characterizes the region. Recent decades show a slowdown in the increase rate of SST along the Western Iberian Coast. An upwelling intensification could justify this observation, along with the effect of teleconnections on the regional climate, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation Index (WeMOI). Our results suggest that the WeMOI plays a more important role in coastal SST variability than the other teleconnections. The present study quantifies regional changes in SST and enhances knowledge of the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in regulating climate and weather conditions. Moreover, it provides a relevant scientific context to the development of regional adaptative and mitigation actions in response to climate change.","","article","","888","","","40 years of changes in sea surface temperature along the Western Iberian Coast","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723028140","0048-9697","2023","164193","Science of The Total Environment"

This rich history has left its mark on the seabed but accurate maps showing the location and character of surviving seabed archaeology do not exist to the same extent as for archaeology on land. ORCA Marine was commissioned by Historic Scotland to work with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in interrogating marine data sets to enhance historic environment records of Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth. These waters were prioritised for their history of maritime activity and to help guide planning and developments in an area highlighted by the Scottish Government for marine renewable energy. A variety of recent and legacy datasets, including wreck databases; sonar data gathered by public sector bodies; aerial photography; seabed cores; Admiralty charts; and local knowledge, were examined for their effectiveness in discovering and interpreting marine cultural heritage cost-effectively. A methodology was developed that enabled marine cultural heritage information to be quickly assimilated within the national and regional inventories for dissemination online. Polygonisation of records resulted in GIS-based shapefiles identifying site extents, and areas of archaeological potential in relation to wrecks, submerged prehistoric landscapes, anchorages and fishing areas. Substantial gaps in data coverage were identified and areas of the seabed have been surveyed at resolutions that are sufficient to detect large upstanding remains such as iron shipwrecks but insufficient to identify smaller archaeological features. Other geophysical datasets have been created at a resolution detailed enough to allow the recognition of smaller anomalies but in some cases processing of the data has removed small anomalies of interest to archaeologists. Intensively used marine areas often contain the most artefactual remains such as historic ports being developed to service the marine renewable industry. Zones of high wave and tidal energy favoured for renewable energy devices include navigation channels and hazards where a large number of wrecks are documented. Transmission cable routes cross deep water where 20th-century wartime losses occurred. Planning and development of infrastructure relating to renewables may also interact with significant built heritage and archaeology on the foreshore and coast edge.","","article","","99","","","Insights from archaeological analysis and interpretation of marine data sets to inform marine cultural heritage management and planning of wave and tidal energy development for Orkney Waters and the Pentland Firth, NE Scotland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569114001604","0964-5691","2014","39-51","Ocean & Coastal Management"

Salvage operation of the vessel started immediately after the wreck. This operation was the largest and most expensive maritime salvage ever attempted on a wrecked ship and it ended in July 2014 when the Costa Concordia was removed from the Giglio Island, and dragged in the port of Genoa where it was dismantled. The refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were monitored, in the period between 14th and 27th of July, exploiting SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in crisis mode. The main targets of the monitoring system were: (i) the detection of possible spill of pollutant material from the vessel and (ii) to exclude that oil slicks, illegally produced by other vessels, could be improperly linked to the naval convoy during its transit along the route between the Giglio Island and the port of Genoa. Results point out that the adopted monitoring system, through the use of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can be profitably employed to monitor emergency phases related to single ship or naval convoy over wide areas and with a suitable temporal coverage.

These signals are received by shore side AIS Base stations. The use of AIS is mandatory under international SOLAS regulations for certain categories of vessels. AIS is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue (SAR) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their AIS transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their AIS transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with SOLAS regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, AIS transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field (RSSI) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming AIS messages with. The technique presented, analyses received RSSI in combination with predicted RSSI values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National AIS was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in RSSI of approximately 10 dBm (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.","","article","","202","","","A novel technique to identify AIS transmissions from vessels which attempt to obscure their position by switching their AIS transponder from normal transmit power mode to low transmit power mode","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422005905","0957-4174","2022","117205","Expert Systems with Applications"

This paper presents a novel acoustic-based in-situ monitoring method for the DED process. The raw acoustic signal is made up of laser-material interaction sound as well as noise from machine movement, inert gas flow, and powder flow. A deep learning model is developed to build an end-to-end signal denoising framework to minimize environmental noise and extract the laser-material interaction sound. Audio equalization, bandpass filtering, and Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation algorithm are used to produce a cleaned laser-material interaction sound as the model's ground truth target. Acoustic data is collected from experiments using different DED machines, materials, and varied process parameters to train the deep learning model.

Vehicles tend to have limited processing resources and are energy-constrained. So, any security provision needs to abide by these limitations. At the same time, attacks against vehicles are very rare, often making knowledge-based intrusion detection systems less practical than behaviour-based ones, which is the reverse of what is seen in conventional computing systems. Furthermore, vehicle design and implementation can differ wildly between different types or different manufacturers, which can lead to intrusion detection designs that are vehicle-specific. Equally importantly, vehicles are practically defined by their ability to move, autonomously or not. Movement, as well as other physical manifestations of their operation may allow cyber security breaches to lead to physical damage, but can also be an opportunity for detection. For example, physical sensing can contribute to more accurate or more rapid intrusion detection through observation and analysis of physical manifestations of a security breach. This paper presents a classification and survey of intrusion detection systems designed and evaluated specifically on vehicles and networks of vehicles. Its aim is to help identify existing techniques that can be adopted in the industry, along with their advantages and disadvantages, as well as to identify gaps in the literature, which are attractive and highly meaningful areas of future research.","","article","","84","","","A taxonomy and survey of cyber-physical intrusion detection approaches for vehicles","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870518307091","1570-8705","2019","124-147","Ad Hoc Networks"

In recent years, several supervised DDoS detection algorithms have been proposed. However, these algorithms require a priori knowledge of the classes and cannot automatically adapt to frequently changing network traffic trends. This emphasizes the need for the development of new DDoS detection mechanisms that target zero-day and sophisticated DDoS attacks. In this paper, we propose an online, sequential, DDoS detection scheme that is suitable for use with multivariate data. The proposed algorithm utilizes a kernel-based learning algorithm, the Mahalanobis distance, and a chi-square test. Initially, we extract four entropy-based and four statistical features from network flows per minute as detection metrics. Then, we employ the kernel-based learning algorithm using the entropy features to detect input vectors that were suspected to be DDoS. This algorithm assumes no model for network traffic or DDoS. It constructs and adapts a dictionary of features that approximately span the subspace of normal behavior. Every T minutes, the Mahalanobis distance between suspicious vectors and the distribution of dictionary members is measured. Subsequently, the chi-square test is used to evaluate the Mahalanobis distance. The proposed DDoS detection scheme was applied to the CICIDS2017 dataset, and we compared the results with those given by existing algorithms. It was demonstrated that the proposed online detection scheme outperforms almost all available DDoS classification algorithms with an offline learning process.","","article","","168","","","Online DDoS attack detection using Mahalanobis distance and Kernel-based learning algorithm","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804520302307","1084-8045","2020","102756","Journal of Network and Computer Applications"

Change detection maps show areas of significant decline in NDVI in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area especially during the summer. The Channel Islands have relatively stable NDVI possibly due to the removal of non-native herbivores and the maritime climate around the Channel Islands may buffer some of the impacts of the regional drought.

The problem of minimizing energy usage is NP-hard, making it difficult to solve optimally. In order to tackle this challenge, we used the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme. DDPG is used to enhance the convergence speed and eliminate redundant computations. Furthermore, to improve the detection in real-time, we proposed the proximal online policy technique (POPT). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme consumes 37.14%, 31.25%, and 21.42% better results than synthetic aperture radar (SAR), convolution neural network (CNN), and double deep recurrent Q-network (DDRQN).","","article","","195","","","Deep reinforcement learning based trajectory optimization for magnetometer-mounted UAV to landmine detection","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366422003413","0140-3664","2022","441-450","Computer Communications"

Context is the information relevant to, but not directly affecting, the problem at hand and can be broadly categorised into either context-for or context-of, referring either to the information related to some situation or to the environment induced by some situation, respectively. In evidence theory, the Behaviour-Based Correction (BBC) model generalises reasoning with partially reliable sources as well as contextual belief correction. In this paper, we propose a model for contextual reasoning framed into evidence theory, which captures both the notions of context-for and context-of. We rephrase the BBC model to explicitly account for variation of metaknowledge regarding source behaviour, and subsequently include within it the variables defining the context-for the problem and the context-for the source. The benefit is two-fold: on the one hand, the explicit inclusion of context in the reasoning provides a better insight into the problem and on the other hand, it can improve the expressiveness of the model. This is illustrated on a case of maritime surveillance involving a missing vessel, where it is shown that this model is not only more expressive than the simple fusion of sources model but also more interpretable.","","article","","153","","","Context-awareness for information correction and reasoning in evidence theory","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X22001943","0888-613X","2023","29-48","International Journal of Approximate Reasoning"

The mutual data exchange between the physical and virtual environment, which is the basis of a true Digital Twin, is mostly missing, confusing a virtual model with a sophisticated living virtual environment. Few reviews are available in the literature for Digital Twins on ships. This systematic review proposes the identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields. Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research advancements in the topic.

In this study, we propose a novel approach to perform long-term forecasts of daily water dynamics, including river levels, river discharges, and groundwater levels, with a lead time of 7–30 days. The approach is based on the state-of-the-art neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), to enhance the accuracy and consistency of dynamic predictions. The operation of this forecasting system relies on an in-situ database observed for over 50 years with records gauging in 19 rivers, the karst aquifer, the English Channel, and the meteorological network in Normandy, France. To address the problem of missing measurements and gauge installations over time, we developed an adaptive scheme in which the neural network is regularly adjusted and re-trained in response to changing inputs during a long operation. Advances in BiLSTM with extensive learning past-to-future and future-to-past further help to avoid time-lag calibration that simplifies data processing. The proposed approach provides high accuracy and consistent prediction for the three water dynamics within a similar accuracy range as an on-site observation, with approximately 3 % error in the measurement range for the 7 day-ahead predictions and 6 % error for the 30 d-ahead predictions. The system also effectively fills the gap in actual measurements and detects anomalies at gauges that can last for years. Working with multiple dynamics not only proves that the data-driven model is a unified approach but also reveals the impact of the physical background of the dynamics on the performance of their predictions. Groundwater undergoes a slow filtration process following a low-frequency fluctuation, favoring long-term prediction, which differs from other higher-frequency river dynamics. The physical nature drives the predictive performance even when using a data-driven model.","","article","","880","","","Long-run forecasting surface and groundwater dynamics from intermittent observation data: An evaluation for 50 years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723019575","0048-9697","2023","163338","Science of The Total Environment"

The growing activities in the marine sensor environment increased the threat of anomalies and cyber-attacks. Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and classical machine learning-based models have been proposed to secure the sensor-based IoT infrastructure. Still, these mechanisms have failed to achieve significant results for securing the marine sensor environment due to the discriminant requirements of the IoT appliances in deep oceans, such as distribution, information complexity, scalability, higher network bandwidth requirements, and low computational capacity. Hence, we propose a lightweight and robust ensemble model to secure the marine IoT environment from cyber-attacks and malicious activities.

The experiments were conducted on Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS) dataset. The proposed methodology includes a label encoding technique for best feature selection, hyper-parameter tuning, ensemble function, and a novel algorithm to develop an ocean IoT attack detection model. As an extension of traditional methods, the optimized Light-GBM model can handle the distributed IoT attacks in the deeper marine environments with low computational cost and with 98.52% detection accuracy.

The epicontinental caldera complex formed during the opening of the late Paleozoic Maritimes Basin in the northern Appalachians. The mafic and intermediate rocks make up two compositionally distinct associations. The first association includes evolved rift-related continental tholeiitic basalts, and the second association comprises calc-alkaline andesites, although both associations were emplaced penecontemporaneously. The basalts have low Mg#~0.34–0.40, smooth chondrite-normalized REE patterns with (La/Yb)n~5–6, primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns without noticeable negative Nb–Ta anomalies, and their ɛNd(T) ranges from +2.5 to +2.2. The basalts were generated by partial melting of a transition zone between spinel and garnet mantle peridotite at a depth of ~70–90km. The calc-alkaline andesites of the second association have chondrite-normalized REE patterns that are more fractionated, with (La/Yb)n~7–8.5, but without significant negative Eu anomalies. Compared to the basaltic rocks, they have lower ɛNd(T) values, ranging from +0.5 to +1.9, and their mantle-normalized trace element plots show negative Nb–Ta anomalies. The ɛNd(T) values display negative correlations with indicators of crustal contamination, such as Th/La, Th/Nb and SiO2. The andesitic rocks are interpreted to have formed by assimilation–fractional crystallization processes, which resulted in the contamination of a precursor basaltic magma with crustal material. The parent basaltic magma for both suites underwent a different evolution. The tholeiitic basalts experienced shallow-seated fractional crystallization and evolved along a tholeiitic trend of “early iron” enrichment (non-oxic conditions). The contaminated magma of the second association followed a calc-alkaline fractionation trend of “no iron” enrichment (oxidizing conditions) characterized by a high PH2O and PO2 environment at the mid-crust levels. The Piskahegan Group, which is associated with an important polymetallic mineral deposit, differs from the numerous non-mineralized rift-related volcanic suites of the regional Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous successions in the Maritimes Basin by the presence of a significant amount of coeval calc-alkaline andesite, which may be an indicator of potential mineralization.","","article","","262","","","Upper Paleozoic mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks of the Mount Pleasant caldera associated with the Sn–W deposit in southwestern New Brunswick (Canada): Petrogenesis and metallogenic implications","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493716301943","0024-4937","2016","428-441","Lithos"

This report describes the results of 1721 regional well sites. Three samples of water were collected from each site and analyzed in four different laboratories for twenty constituents. The distribution and relationships of U, Rn, He F, CH4, Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, Fe, pH, suspended matter, depth of well, conductivity and alkalinity are described. The elements U, Rn, He, F, along with conductivity and alkalinity, show systematic regional patterns indicating broad regional belts of element enrichment which are being leached by circulating groundwaters. The close spatial association of these elements over many tens of miles suggests chemical reaction cells or fronts similar to those observed in the uranium mining districts of Colorado and Wyoming in the United States and elsewhere. Their relatively weak character suggests an intermediate cycle in the cyclic enrichment hypothesis believed to be responsible for the formation of epigenetic uranium ore deposits. The heavy elements Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Fe show positive correlation with each other but their spatial distribution is more spotty than that of the uranium elements. Broadly speaking the anomalies of these elements cluster mainly on the southern border of the survey area. Most of the anomalies can be explained in terms of known mineral occurrences The most prominent CH4 anomaly is located south of Moncton and is believed to be due to the old St. Josephs gas and oil field.

Current research is focused on finding ways to make marine hydrogen storage tanks stable and safe in these conditions. The use of hydrogen as a source of energy requires four main technologies: production, storage, transportation, and application. In this study, the fastening method for the hydrogen storage tank on the ship, node optimization, failure analysis, and real-time structural inspection of the connection node between the hydrogen storage tank and the ship are all covered. The failure processes and influencing variables of marine hydrogen storage tanks are distinct because in complex sea conditions, the fixed nodes of hydrogen storage tanks on ships are susceptible to hydrodynamic loads from waves and currents. The application of fiber optic nondestructive testing, digital twin technology, and intelligent sensing technology to the deteriorating performance and damage patterns of crucial ship connection nodes is covered in this study.

For fault detection, a Kalman filter is employed to estimate the blade pitch angle and valve spool position of the blade pitch system. The fault diagnosis scheme is based on an artificial neural network method with supervised learning that is capable of diagnosing a predetermined fault type. The neural network algorithm produces a predictive model with training, validation and test procedures after the final performance evaluation. The validation and test procedures of the artificial neural network model are conducted with the training model to prove the model performance. The proposed method is demonstrated in case studies of a spar floating wind turbine with stochastic wind and wave conditions and with consideration of six different types of faults, such as biases and fixed outputs in pitch sensors and excessive friction, slit-lock, wrong voltage, and circuit shortage in actuators.

However, previous studies for south-east Asia have found a very limited association between synoptic variables and the reported number of dengue cases. Hence there is an urgent need to establish a more clear association with dengue incidence rates and the most relevant meteorological variables in order to institute an early warning system. This article develops a rigorous Bayesian modelling framework to identify the most important covariates and their lagged effects for constructing an early warning system for the Central Region of Malaysia where the case rates have increased substantially in the recent past. Our modelling includes multiple synoptic scale Niño indices, which are related to the phenomenon of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), along with other relevant mesoscale environmental measurements and an unobserved variable derived from reanalysis data. An empirically well validated hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal is used to build a probabilistic early warning system for detecting an upcoming dengue epidemic. Our study finds a 46.87% increase in dengue cases due to one degree increase in the central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature with a lag time of six weeks. We discover the existence of a mild association with relative risk 0.9774 (CI: 0.9602, 0.9947) between the rate of cases and a distant lagged cooling effect in the region of coastal South America related to a phenomenon called El Niño Modoki. The Bayesian model also establishes that the synoptic meteorological drivers can enhance short-term early detection of dengue outbreaks and these can also potentially be used to provide longer-term forecasts.","","article","","36","","","Spatio-temporal detection for dengue outbreaks in the Central Region of Malaysia using climatic drivers at mesoscale and synoptic scale","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096322000365","2212-0963","2022","100429","Climate Risk Management"

Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction.

This task has been traditionally approached by using a-priori models to differentiate potential Anthropogenic Space Objects from the background noise. Source extraction and track-before-detect methods rely on absolute pixel intensity thresholding and require substantial processing to remove noise (stars, hot pixels, etc.), while machine learning shows promise in reducing processing and improving low-visibility performance but requires context-specific labeled training data. We introduce a new approach based on a-contrario detection, arguing that any space object must be unattributable to noise using a sequence of low-fidelity hypotheses. Through this approach, we aim to relax the dependency on a-priori assumptions of data content and improve performance where high-quality data is sparse, poorly labeled, or challenging to characterize, e.g., in satellite-based applications, and provide detection confidence measures from individual data content to enhance risk evaluation for orbital populations. We present an initial qualitative proof-of-concept for our a-contrario approach using data collected by the ASTRIANet telescope network, showing potentially strong performance on Medium Earth Orbit observations for both rate and sidereal-tracking telescope modes. We also discuss how our approach handles epistemic uncertainties, i.e., a lack of a-priori model information, with implications to Type I and Type II error sources and potential mitigation steps when considering Low Earth Orbit observations with higher tracking noise.","","article","","200","","","A-contrario structural inference for space object detection and tracking","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576522003915","0094-5765","2022","86-96","Acta Astronautica"

In this context, semantic web technologies are increasingly considered as key technologies to improve data integration. However, they are mainly used for data that is assumed not to change very often in time. In order to tackle this issue, stream reasoning combines reasoning and stream processing methods. Such a combination enables the processing of dynamic and heterogeneous data continuously produced from a large number of sources and implementing real-time services. This paper presents an approach that uses stream reasoning to identify in real time certain situations that lead to potential failures. Early detection enables to choose the most appropriate decision to avoid the interruption of manufacturing processes. In order to achieve this, data collected from sensors are enriched with contextual information.

Accordingly, solutions to effectively detect road accidents can be a game-changer for road safety. The focus is on Vision Zero, i.e., eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries. However, when an accident occurs, response time is essential. Several countries have surveillance cameras monitoring the road network. However, real-time monitoring requires a considerable number of people with training and attention. Our solution automates this with AI, using deep learning to train a model to detect potential accidents. The CV method based on binary image classification was used, being images without accidents classified as normal and images with accidents as alarm. The biggest challenge in developing the model was obtaining images of accidents from the analyzed cameras. The solution adopted was to create synthetic images of these rare events.

Shipowners need to consider the economic cost, energy feasibility, and other relevant factors of different schemes before making decisions. This paper empirically explores the factors that affect shipowners' energy choices.

The computation of vessel trajectory similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based methods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory similarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be guaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation results.","","article","","225","","","An unsupervised learning method with convolutional auto-encoder for vessel trajectory similarity computation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801821002389","0029-8018","2021","108803","Ocean Engineering"

The wooden hull is recognisable in the seismic sections as a high amplitude anomaly underlain by an acoustic blanking zone. Close survey line spacing (ca. 1m) allowed the construction of time slices, identifying the ovate plan of the hull.

The ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution is often used for red tide detection, but is insufficient for the fine-scale red tide detection due to its coarse spatial resolution. To address this problem, a new red tide detection method based on pseudo hue angle (PHA-RI) for high spatial resolution broad band satellite data is proposed in this paper. Different from the standard International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system, the false-color bands of near infrared (NIR), red and green are used to calculate the CIE tristimulus X, Y, Z, instead of the true-color bands of red, green and blue. With this method, the red tide can be easily differentiated from non-red tide water, and the distinction between red tide and non-red tide water is doubled compared to that of true-color bands composite. Experiment results show that the PHA-RI method can effectively detect red tide, with an averaged overall accuracy, F1-score and precision of 92%, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively. Compared with the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM) and spectral index algorithm Gaofen-1 (GF-1) red tide detection index (GF-RI), the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages in red tide detection, especially for the strip distributed red tide. Besides, the proposed algorithm has good applicability, and it is proved to be suitable for the detection of red tides with different dominant species including Noctiluca scintillans, Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiide. Also, it is applicable to different broad band sensors, such as Chinese satellites GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV), Haiyang 1D (HY-1D) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The application experiment indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in red tide detection, and it can successfully detect fine-scale red tide events, which have not been detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua due to its coarse spatial resolution. The results also shows the advantages of high spatial resolution satellites in fine-scale red tide detection.

A slight monthly variation was observed with maximum and minimum values in the cold (∼6 μg m−3) and warm (∼4 μg m−3) seasons respectively.

An unexpected upward trend was obtained in the last five years. The periods with elevated NO2 concentrations in the last years were analyzed, showing an increase in its frequency and concentrations, linked with the upward trend observed. The weather conditions in these NO2 peaks were studied using local surface meteorology, mean sea level pressure and wind fields from the data reanalysis of ERA5. The transport of NO2 was explored using TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) measurements. The events occurred under conditions governed by high-pressure systems, which induced weak synoptic airflows or the development of mesoscale processes. Four scenarios of NO2 transport were identified, associated with weak synoptic flows from inland or Southern Portugal and with mesoscale processes. The gulf of Cadiz plays an important role as a reservoir where the NO2 coming from the south of Portugal, the Western Mediterranean Basin and urban-industrial areas can be accumulated and later transported inland. A strong correlation was found between the increase of NO2 observed in the last years and positive anomalies of the temperature and geopotential height at 850 and 500 hPa levels. These findings could indicate that the causes of the changes in the NO2 would be attributed to alterations in the weather patterns associated with a warmer climate.","","article","","264","","","Ground-based and OMI-TROPOMI NO2 measurements at El Arenosillo observatory: Unexpected upward trends","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974912030703X","0269-7491","2020","114771","Environmental Pollution"

It distends across three main European biogeographical regions – Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean – and therefore has a very high level of forest diversity comprised of 11 out of 14 European forest types. This makes it very convenient to study the exposure of main European forest types to extreme climatic events in the southern limits of their species distribution range. This study provides an assessment of responses of forest vegetation under episodes of climatic anomalies consisting of the most severe historical dry and warm spells in 2000 and 2003, together with the extremely rainy season in 2005 across Croatian territory. The question of interest in this study was to reveal how the existing forest types across the territorial gradient respond to highly expressed extreme climatic variations and to infer some clues about related adaptive strategies. The regional scale approach was applied which previously performed structural delineation of forest cover into eleven main forest groups or bioclimates and were examined considering functional differences. Responses of eleven bioclimatic types were analyzed by time series (1998–2005) of monthly FAPAR (The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation) coverage with a spatial resolution of 1.2km, freely available from JRC FAPAR project. To quantify and differentiate the vegetation response in the considered years we adopted indices of resilience (resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience). We also provided a modified approach by applying these indices on a seasonal scale to examine the relationship between variations of phenology and ecosystem responses. The results confirmed the modification of seasonality of photosynthetic activity in relation to the altitudinal and spatial gradient. At the intra-seasonal scale, we distinguished specific opportunistic behavior of the common beech and oak forest types to alternating climatic conditions. Beech forest types show a very high ability to shift their phenology to earlier spring warming as a consequence of global warming. However, continental and Mediterranean oak forest types and in particular Aleppo pine and holm oak forests showed a higher increase of FAPAR during rainy events. The revealed capability of some tree species to better exploit rainfall in very wet periodic episodes has to be further evaluated in drawing conclusions about the overall resilience of forests under future climate change scenarios.","","article","","326","","","Response strategies of the main forest types to climatic anomalies across Croatian biogeographic regions inferred from FAPAR remote sensing data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714002448","0378-1127","2014","58-78","Forest Ecology and Management"

As AIS reports are featured with huge volume and noises, preprocessing of AIS data is essential before its further application. This study aims to develop effective algorithms to denoise and compress raw trajectories derived from AIS reports. Specifically, an effective noise detection method based on statistical theory and sliding window is first proposed to identify glitches in a given trajectory. Linear interpolation is further used to rectify the glitches detected. Then, two modes of algorithms are proposed for trajectory compression: static mode with preset threshold for compression and dynamic mode considering the distance between trajectory points and the coastline in a real-time manner. Numerical experiments show that the noise detection and rectification algorithms and the trajectory compression algorithms are accurate and highly efficient considering compression rate, information loss, and computation time. The main innovation of this research includes developing an accurate and robust trajectory glitch detection and rectification algorithm, proposing two modes of trajectory compression algorithms, and combining the two tasks in a holistic robust framework. Especially, the dynamic compression mode can overcome a major problem encountered in static compression where the compressed trajectories may go across land. It can also deal with more flexible compression requirements and thus should be more applicable in practice.","","article","","252","","","Development of denoising and compression algorithms for AIS-based vessel trajectories","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801822006084","0029-8018","2022","111207","Ocean Engineering"

Firstly, the relationships between typical hydroclimatic features of the world's major climate zones and hydrological drought are characterised. Across all climate zones, hydrological drought is associated with some anomaly in the timing, occurrence or persistence of atmospheric circulation. These anomalies are often connected to large-scale ocean-atmosphere modes of variation such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation. The consequent meteorological water balance deficits often propagate into hydrological drought, but the connection is not always straightforward: land surface characteristics and feedbacks can be critical to hydrological drought onset and, later, termination. Consequently, the spatial and temporal signature of hydrological drought can be quite different to the initial atmospheric anomalies. Notwithstanding the complexity of the climate–hydrology relationships, ongoing and additional future changes in the global climate system will inevitably be manifested in hydrological drought characteristics.","","incollection","Elsevier","","Hydrological Drought (Second Edition)","978-0-12-819082-1","Chapter 2 - Hydroclimatology∗∗This chapter builds upon: Stahl, K., Hisdal, H., 2004.

Together, these case studies demonstrate the capabilities of magnetic detection instruments in various modes of operation for finding datable archaeological deposits that span the breadth of known human occupation of this region. The examples range from the simplest use of the magnetometer as a single sensor reconnaissance instrument in a “search mode”, to use as a gradiometer in conjunction with other geophysical methods such as ground-penetrating radar, to record precise measurements and inform nuanced interpretations. Examples presented here range from the terminal Pleistocene to historic periods, spanning 12,000 years of human activity in Eastern Beringia, and encompassing the arrival, emergence, and expansion of multiple human groups or cultural traditions in the New World.","","article","","211","","","Magnetic detection of archaeological hearths in Alaska: A tool for investigating the full span of human presence at the gateway to North America","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118310370","0277-3791","2019","73-92","Quaternary Science Reviews"

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may provide new opportunities to upgrade WAAM to the next generation. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research on AI techniques in WAAM. Firstly, we proposed a novel concept of intelligent wire arc additive manufacturing (IWAAM) and revealed the challenges of developing IWAAM. Secondly, an overview of the research progress of applying AI techniques to several aspects of the WAAM process chain, including fabrication process pre-design, online deposition control and offline parameter optimization is provided. Thirdly, the relevant machine learning algorithms, and the knowledge of corresponding AI techniques, are also reviewed in detail. Through reviewing the current research articles, issues of applying AI techniques to the WAAM process are presented and analysed.

One of the biggest maritime challenges arose due to regulations about emissions and has begun to be a worldwide concern. The maritime industry has enormous potential in terms of a reduction in energy use and emission supervision, especially with respect to existing ships. The specific challenges to shipping are energy inefficiency and emissions; vessel electrification, where sailing displacements and infrastructures permit; and vessel performance optimization. One of these challenges is addressed in this work: operational improvement in detection of the impact of fouling or opposite hull cleaning which enables greater efficiency and an increase in performance. In this paper, battery hybrid electric ship automation data are analysed using Curve Fitting and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) in order to interpret the impact of fouling on ship energy performance degradation by continuous monitoring. Although this methodology is already used for analysing various time series data, DFA is a novel approach that is first time that applied to a marine based data where fouling contains marine biological properties. Application of these techniques reveal that in only 9 months fouling, performance degradation of case study ferry faced 6% of average speed loss.","","article","","105","","","Assessment of the impact of fouling on vessel energy efficiency by analyzing ship automation data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118720309779","0141-1187","2020","102418","Applied Ocean Research"

It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","","article","","218","","","A semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on AIS data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096456912100497X","0964-5691","2022","106015","Ocean & Coastal Management"

The literature has witnessed earlier research approaches to RAM analysis.

In recent times, digital components and systems comprising information and communication technologies, smart devices, efficient gateways, faster protocols have transformed the CIs. This transformation comes with a considerable cost, such as the necessity to integrate innovative cyber-defense measures and policies due to new vulnerabilities, efficient maintenance strategies, risk management scenario development, resilience with self-healing architecture. Nevertheless, the current knowledge body lacks an up-to-date Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focused on addressing integrated protection aspects, recent developments, and evaluation criteria towards RAMS analysis for CIs. Accordingly, this study aims to provide a comprehensive SLR on existing studies dealing with developing techniques, methodologies, protocols, models, and RAMS analysis tools for different applications. This SLR followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. 1513 records published between 2011 and 2020 are initially identified, which are later screened to 212 records to be considered for the eligibility check process. Finally, after examining the exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 19 articles are included in this research. In this SLR, a comparative analysis of existing solutions based on included studies is presented in different aspects such as developed architectures and methodologies, performance evaluation mechanisms, implementation scenarios, targeted applications, pros and cons, and applied CIs protection aspects associated with RAMS. The findings suggest that RAMS analysis for CIs is an emerging research area, with currently focused applications including power grid stations, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud computing, maritime transportation, and Industrial Control Systems. 36.8% of the studies have performed a real-time implementation, while the remaining approaches have either performed simulation or preliminary analysis.

There have only been a few algorithms proposed for detecting spatial and/or temporal outliers. One example is the Local Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (LDBSCAN). Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is mainly for clustering; it just tells us whether an object belongs to a cluster or it is an outlier. A measure known as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) gives a quantitative measure of outlierness to each object, where a high LOF score means it is potentially an outlier. LDBSCAN algorithm, which combines the above notions, considers only the spatial context. Furthermore, the notion of a cluster is defeated (i.e. LDBSCAN may report clusters having less than the minimum required points in a cluster), and some of the outliers may not be detected because of the limitation of the existing conditions in the LDBSCAN algorithm. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, namely Spatio-Temporal Behavioral Density-based Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-BDBCAN) and Approx-ST-BDBCAN. ST-BDBCAN algorithm adopts the proposed, new concept, called Spatio-Temporal Behavioral Outlier Factor (ST-BOF), which is a spatio-temporal extension to LOF. It also uses both spatial and temporal attributes simultaneously to define the context. By doing so, the relative importance of spatial continuity or temporal continuity appropriate to the application at hand can be established. The Approx-ST-BDBCAN algorithm achieves improved scalability, with minimal loss of detection accuracy by partitioning data points for parallel processing. Experimental results on synthetic, and buoy datasets suggest that our proposed algorithms are accurate and computationally efficient. Additionally, new Outlier Association with Hurricane Intensity Index (OAHII) measures are introduced for quantitative evaluation of the results from buoy dataset.","","article","","122","","","Spatio-temporal outlier detection algorithms based on computing behavioral outlierness factor","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X17301829","0169-023X","2019","1-24","Data & Knowledge Engineering"

However, despite recent efforts to mechanistically understand these changes, little focus has been given to the phytoplankton seasonal succession, remaining uncertainties regarding to distribution patterns of emerging taxa along the NAP. To fill this gap, we collected phytoplankton (pigment and microscopy analysis) and physico-chemical datasets during spring and summer (November, February and March) of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 off the NAP. Satellite measurements (sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration and chlorophyll-a) were used to extend the temporal coverage of analysis associated with the in situ sampling. We improved the quantification and distribution pattern of emerging taxa, such as dinoflagellates and cryptophytes, and described a contrasting seasonal behavior and distinct fundamental niche between centric and pennate diatoms. Cryptophytes and pennate diatoms preferentially occupied relatively shallower mixing layers compared with centric diatoms and dinoflagellates, suggesting differences between these groups in distribution and environment occupation over the phytoplankton seasonal succession. Under colder conditions, negative sea surface temperature anomalies were associated with positive anomalies of sea ice concentration and duration. Therefore, based on sea ice–phytoplankton growth relationship, large phytoplankton biomass accumulation was expected during the spring/summer of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 along the NAP. However, there was a decoupling between sea ice concentration/duration and phytoplankton biomass, characterizing two seasonal periods of low biomass accumulation (negative chlorophyll-a anomalies), associated with the top-down control in the region.

Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.","","article","","201","","","A comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002980182030233X","0029-8018","2020","107174","Ocean Engineering"

Firstly, an AIS-based probabilistic buoy domain model is adopted for the determination of the safety boundary of the buoy to detect potential striking ships with a higher contact probability. Then, the bounding boxes of the navigational buoy and the detected potential striking ships are developed to detect the real striking ship by analyzing the interaction between the ship bounding box and the buoy bounding box. Finally, the probabilistic analytics method is demonstrated in the South China Sea and validated using historical ship-buoy contact records. Results indicated that, from a probabilistic perspective, the safety buoy domain (critical boundary) existed with diverse distances dynamically. The proposed method could assist the identification of striking ships while aiding the definition of the safety buoy domain for preventing ship-buoy contacts.

The method is capable of generating ship route automatically according to different ship dimensions, which has been evaluated on two real routes around the world.","","article","","96","","","Automatic ship route design between two ports: A data-driven method","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118718309118","0141-1187","2020","102049","Applied Ocean Research"

Different abiotic and biotic factors may interact to cause forest decline and accelerated tree mortality. We studied a mixed Mediterranean continental forest where Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) shows widespread decline to analyse the role of different abiotic and biotic factors on health status and growth dynamics both at the individual and plot levels. We also analysed stand composition and regeneration of tree species to check whether there is a change in species dominance. Fungal pathogens were seldom present and we detected no pervasive fungi or insect infestation and no presence of pathogens like Heterobasidion or Phytophthora. Infection of hemiparasite plants like Viscum album L. (mistletoe) can reduce leaf area and its abundance is generally considered an expression of host decline. Yet, the existence among declining trees of high defoliation levels without mistletoe, but not vice versa, suggests that defoliation in response to some abiotic stressor could be a predisposing factor preceding mistletoe infection. Compared to healthy trees, declining and dead trees exhibited higher defoliation rates, smaller needles and lower recent growth with steeper negative trends. Dead and declining trees showed similar negative growth trends since the early 1990s droughts, which we interpreted as early warning signals anticipating mortality of currently declining trees in the near future. Mortality of maritime pine extending across all size classes, the lower presence of this species in the smallest size classes and its lack of regeneration suggest it is potentially losing its current dominance and being replaced by other co-occurring, more drought-tolerant species. Our results unravelled that maritime pine decline seems to be mainly driven by a combination of predisposing and inciting abiotic factors (microenvironment and drought stress) and biotic factors (mistletoe). The absence of widespread fungal pathogens suggests that they may have a minor role on pine decline acting only eventually as contributing factors. Although there could be other interrelations among factors or other biotic agents at play, our results strongly suggest that water stress plays a major role in the decline process of the dominant species on an ecosystem with strong land-use legacies.","","article","","685","","","Synergistic abiotic and biotic stressors explain widespread decline of Pinus pinaster in a mixed forest","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719324313","0048-9697","2019","963-975","Science of The Total Environment"

These technologies serve as the pivot around which cyber data from the military’s Internet of Battlefield Things, for example, will be turned into actionable insight and knowledge and, ultimately, an information advantage for the military. As such, network intrusion detection systems must detect, evaluate, and respond to malicious cyber traffic at machine speed. Generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders are fit as generative models with labeled cyber data from a real military enterprise network. These generative models are used to create realistic, synthetic cyber data. A combination of real and synthetic cyber data sets are then used to train several machine learning models for network intrusion detection. Purely synthetic data is shown to be statistically similar to the real data. There is no statistically significant difference in the performance of classifiers trained with real data versus a combination of real and synthetic data; however, classifiers trained with only synthetic data underperformed. To avoid a decrease in intrusion detection performance, classifiers must be trained with at least 15% real data.","","article","","207","","","Generating realistic cyber data for training and evaluating machine learning classifiers for network intrusion detection systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422011757","0957-4174","2022","117936","Expert Systems with Applications"

Currently, most of collision accidents at sea are caused by the misjudgement of the ship’s operators. The deployment of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) can greatly reduce ships’ reliance on human operators by using an automated intelligent collision avoidance system to replace human decision-making. To successfully develop such a system, the capability of autonomously identifying other ships and evaluating their associated encountering situation is of paramount importance. In this paper, we aim to identify ships’ encounter situation modes using deep learning methods based upon the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. First, a segmentation process is developed to divide each ship’s AIS data into different segments that contain only one encounter situation mode. This is different to the majority of studies that have proposed encounter situation mode classification using hand-crafted features, which may not reflect the actual ship’s movement states. Furthermore, a number of present classification tasks are conducted using substantial labelled AIS data followed by a supervised training paradigm, which is not applicable to our dataset as it contains a large number of unlabelled AIS data. Therefore, a method called Semi-Supervised Convolutional Encoder–Decoder Network (SCEDN) for ship encounter situation classification based on AIS data is proposed. The structure of the network is not only able to automatically extract features from AIS segments but also share training parameters for the unlabelled data. The SCEDN uses an encoder–decoder convolutional structure with four channels for each segment (distance, speed, Time to the Closed Point of Approach (TCPA) and Distance to the Closed Point of Approach (DCPA)) been developed. The performance of the SCEDN model are evaluated by comparing to several baselines with the experimental results demonstrating a higher accuracy can be achieved by our proposed model.","","article","","239","","","A semi-supervised deep learning model for ship encounter situation classification","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801821011823","0029-8018","2021","109824","Ocean Engineering"

Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea.

These difficulties raise four unresolved key challenges in VCMFD: i) ineffective detection in some popular forgery cases; ii) inefficient matching in processing numerous video pixels with hundred-dimensional features under dozens of matching iterations; iii) high false positive (FP) in detecting forgery videos; iv) low trade-off of efficiency and effectiveness in filling forgery region, and even failing in indicating forgeries at the pixel level. In this paper, a novel VCMFD method is proposed to address these issues: i) an innovatively improved SIFT structure that can address the thorough feature extraction in all video copy-move forgery cases; ii) a novel fast keypoint-label matching (FKLM) algorithm is proposed that creates some keypoint-label groups so that every high-dimensional feature is assigned into one of these groups. As a result, matching of video pixels can be directly done on a small number of keypoint-label groups only, leading to a nearly 500% raise in matching efficiency; iii) a new coarse-to-fine filtering relying on intrinsic attributes of exact keypoint-matches is designed to more effectively reduce the false keypoint-matches; iv) the adaptive block filling relying on true keypoint-matches contributes to the accurate and efficient suspicious region filling, even at the pixel level. Finally, the suspicious region locations with the forgery vision persistence concept indicate forgery videos. Compared to the state-of-art methods, the experiments show that our proposed method achieves the best detection accuracy, lowest FP, and improved at least 16% and 8% of F1 scores on the GRIP 2.0 dataset and a combination of SULFA 2.0 & REWIND datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method is with low computational time (4.45 s/Mpixels), which is about 1/2-1/3 times of the latest DFMI-BM (8.02 s/Mpixels) and PM-2D (13.1 s/Mpixels) methods.","","article","","122","","","Effective and efficient pixel-level detection for diverse video copy-move forgery types","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321004660","0031-3203","2022","108286","Pattern Recognition"

In particular, it is still inconclusive whether tropical or extra-tropical factors controlled such precipitation changes. Determining the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation in the IPWP during the LGM is a valid strategy to address this issue, but the existing precipitation records are dominantly from maritime continents and marginal seas, with few data from pelagic oceans. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed the oxygen isotopic compositions of single Ethmodiscus rex diatom frustules (δ18OE. rex) from a sediment core (WPD-03) consisting of laminated diatom mats (LDMs) in the eastern Philippine Sea (EPS). δ18OE. rex was controlled mainly by sea-surface salinity variation and, thus, can reflect open-ocean precipitation changes across the IPWP. Our precipitation proxy records, in combination with existing published data, reveal spatial patterns of precipitation change that indicate overall drying across the IPWP during the LGM. Based on a comparison of paleoclimatic records with modeling results, we propose that extra-tropical factors (ice-sheet size) controlled precipitation variability in the IPWP during the LGM through a combination of zonal shifts of ENSO and meridional migration of the ITCZ. Strong aridity during the LGM prevented formation of a subsurface barrier layer and, hence, allowed accessing of sufficient nutrients to surface waters, stimulating blooms of E. rex and subsequent formation of LDMs in the IPWP. These findings suggest an important role for high-latitude climate in the tropical hydrological cycle during the LGM.","","article","","217","","","Intensified aridity over the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool controlled by ice-sheet expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818122002193","0921-8181","2022","103952","Global and Planetary Change"

The associated emissions may partly counteract efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure. We have developed an approach for assessing methane leakage from marine decommissioned wells based on a combination of existing regional industrial seismic and newly acquired hydroacoustic water column imaging data from the Central North Sea. Here, we present hydroacoustic data which show that 28 out of 43 investigated wells release gas from the seafloor into the water column. This gas release largely depends on the presence of shallow gas accumulations and their distance to the wells. The released gas is likely primarily biogenic methane from shallow sources. In the upper 1,000 m below the seabed, gas migration is likely focused along drilling-induced fractures around the borehole or through non-sealing barriers. Combining available direct measurements for methane release from marine decommissioned wells with our leakage analysis suggests that gas release from investigated decommissioned hydrocarbon wells is a major source of methane in the North Sea (0.9-3.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.7-4.2] kt yr−1 of CH4 for 1,792 wells in the UK sector of the Central North Sea). This means hydrocarbon gas emissions associated with marine hydrocarbon wells are not significant for the global greenhouse gas budget, but have to be considered when compiling regional methane budgets.","","article","","100","","","Greenhouse gas emissions from marine decommissioned hydrocarbon wells: leakage detection, monitoring and mitigation strategies","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583619306504","1750-5836","2020","103119","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

This work provides methods and indicators for evaluation of the maritime picture in terms of completeness as well as update intervals of ship tracks. The distribution of the maximum daily time gap between messages of each ship gives good understanding of the freshness of the maritime picture. The distribution is however very skewed, and therefore not well described by the mean and standard deviation. As a single indicator, the median value gives a description of the typical quality of service, whereas percentile levels give insight in the spread. The data used were collected in August 2015 in the Eastern and Southern Africa/Indian Ocean region. Four providers of satellite AIS data were used, plus coastal AIS, making the data set one of the most complete available. Typically 575,000 AIS messages from 1630 ships were received per day. The median value of the longest time gap in ship tracks was 4.3 h; and the 70- and 90-percentiles were 6.7 h and 19.5 h, respectively. When subsets of all data are used, starting with the data from one provider and adding the others one by one, it is found that the completeness increases asymptotically, but the median of the maximum daily time gap keeps decreasing linearly, showing that additional data in the first place help to track the ships that are already known.","","article","","93","","","Metrics and provider-based results for completeness and temporal resolution of satellite-based AIS services","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17305535","0308-597X","2018","80-92","Marine Policy"

The focus is mainly on radiation, with wavelengths between 170 and 400 nm, but does include other UV radiation which is deposited in the middle atmosphere. Topics are covered in their natural order, beginning with the solar spectral irradiance above the atmosphere, its transmission through the atmosphere, the component which is multiply scattered, UV radiation reaching the biosphere, and direct measurements of photolysis rates. Concluding remarks include recommendations for additional research.","","article","","59","","","Actinic radiation in the terrestrial atmosphere","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682697000473","1364-6826","1997","2111-2157","Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics"

In winter the pack ice canopy extends to cover almost 20 million square kilometres — some 8% of the southern hemisphere and an area larger than the Antarctic continent itself (13.2 million square kilometres) — and is one of the largest, most dynamic ecosystems on earth. Biological activity is associated with all physical components of the sea-ice system: the sea-ice surface; the internal sea-ice matrix and brine channel system; the underside of sea ice and the waters in the vicinity of sea ice that are modified by the presence of sea ice. Microbial and microalgal communities proliferate on and within sea ice and are grazed by a wide range of proto- and macrozooplankton that inhabit the sea ice in large concentrations. Grazing organisms also exploit biogenic material released from the sea ice at ice break-up or melt. Although rates of primary production in the underlying water column are often low because of shading by sea-ice cover, sea ice itself forms a substratum that provides standing stocks of bacteria, algae and grazers significantly higher than those in ice free areas. Decay of sea ice in summer releases particulate and dissolved organic matter to the water column, playing a major role in biogeochemical cycling as well as seeding water column phytoplankton blooms. Numerous zooplankton species graze sea-ice algae, benefiting additionally because the overlying sea-ice ceiling provides a refuge from surface predators. Sea ice is an important nursery habitat for Antarctic krill, the pivotal species in the Southern Ocean marine ecosystem. Some deep-water fish migrate to shallow depths beneath sea ice to exploit the elevated concentrations of some zooplankton there. The increased secondary production associated with pack ice and the sea-ice edge is exploited by many higher predators, with seals, seabirds and whales aggregating there. As a result, much of the Southern Ocean pelagic whaling was concentrated at the edge of the marginal ice zone. The extent and duration of sea ice fluctuate periodically under the influence of global climatic phenomena including the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Life cycles of some associated species may reflect this periodicity. With evidence for climatic warming in some regions of Antarctica, there is concern that ecosystem change may be induced by changes in sea-ice extent. The relative abundance of krill and salps appears to change interannually with sea-ice extent, and in warm years, when salps proliferate, krill are scarce and dependent predators suffer severely. Further research on the Southern Ocean sea-ice system is required, not only to further our basic understanding of the ecology, but also to provide ecosystem managers with the information necessary for the development of strategies in response to short- and medium-term environmental changes in Antarctica. Technological advances are delivering new sampling platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles that are improving vastly our ability to sample the Antarctic under sea-ice environment. Data from such platforms will enhance greatly our understanding of the globally important Southern Ocean sea-ice ecosystem.","","incollection","Academic Press","43","","","Ecology of Southern Ocean pack ice","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065288102430052","0065-2881","2002","171-IN4",""

In this review, we compile archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data from East Africa to document land-cover change, and environmental, subsistence and land-use transitions, over the past 6000 years. Throughout East Africa there have been a series of relatively rapid and high-magnitude environmental shifts characterised by changing hydrological budgets during the mid- to late Holocene. For example, pronounced environmental shifts that manifested as a marked change in the rainfall amount or seasonality and subsequent hydrological budget throughout East Africa occurred around 4000, 800 and 300 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). The past 6000 years have also seen numerous shifts in human interactions with East African ecologies. From the mid-Holocene, land use has both diversified and increased exponentially, this has been associated with the arrival of new subsistence systems, crops, migrants and technologies, all giving rise to a sequence of significant phases of land-cover change. The first large-scale human influences began to occur around 4000 yr BP, associated with the introduction of domesticated livestock and the expansion of pastoral communities. The first widespread and intensive forest clearances were associated with the arrival of iron-using early farming communities around 2500 yr BP, particularly in productive and easily-cleared mid-altitudinal areas. Extensive and pervasive land-cover change has been associated with population growth, immigration and movement of people. The expansion of trading routes between the interior and the coast, starting around 1300 years ago and intensifying in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries CE, was one such process. These caravan routes possibly acted as conduits for spreading New World crops such as maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), although the processes and timings of their introductions remains poorly documented. The introduction of southeast Asian domesticates, especially banana (Musa spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), and chicken (Gallus gallus), via transoceanic biological transfers around and across the Indian Ocean, from at least around 1300 yr BP, and potentially significantly earlier, also had profound social and ecological consequences across parts of the region. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of information and metadatasets, we explore the different drivers and directions of changes in land-cover, and the associated environmental histories and interactions with various cultures, technologies, and subsistence strategies through time and across space in East Africa. This review suggests topics for targeted future research that focus on areas and/or time periods where our understanding of the interactions between people, the environment and land-cover change are most contentious and/or poorly resolved. The review also offers a perspective on how knowledge of regional land-use change can be used to inform and provide perspectives on contemporary issues such as climate and ecosystem change models, conservation strategies, and the achievement of nature-based solutions for development purposes.","","article","","178","","","Drivers and trajectories of land cover change in East Africa: Human and environmental interactions from 6000 years ago to present","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825217303331","0012-8252","2018","322-378","Earth-Science Reviews"

Keays","","","","Platinum-group minerals, Pt-Fe alloys, Placers, Mineralogy, Os isotopes, Origin and depositional history","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2022.104733","The present work reviews assemblages of detrital platinum-group minerals (PGM) in placers worldwide with the aim of identifying common and distinctive features related to their depositional history from primary host rocks via weathering into the placers. Special attention is given to the endogenic destruction of primary PGM and the possible formation of PGM from solution under ambient conditions. The dominant PGMs of economic interest occurring in eluvial and alluvial deposits are Pt-Fe alloys and Os-Ir-Ru alloys. Major current and past producing areas are in Russia (Urals, Koryak-Kamchatka, and Aldan Shield areas), Colombia (Chocó area), Canada (Tulameen area), and the USA (Goodnews Bay). The PGE alloys in all these areas have been sourced from zoned mafic/ultramafic Alaskan-Uralian-type intrusions whereby erosion and weathering of enormous volumes of rock resulted in the concentration of the sparsely disseminated alloys. Subeconomic placers in ophiolite terranes such as in Burma (Chindwin area), Papua New Guinea (Aikora river), and the Philippines (Samar Island) are dominated by Os-Ir-Ru alloys. Minor deposits from the Yubdo area (Ethiopia) and the Freetown Layered Complex (Sierra Leone) have been the subject of many studies to prove or disprove authigenic growth of Pt-Fe alloys and other minerals. To scientifically evaluate the genesis of these minerals, we discuss their mineralogy, silicate and sulfide inclusions, isotopic data, and grain sizes, together with the role of weathering, climate, aqueous geochemistry, and biological activity in their formation. Other deposits and relevant platinum-group element (PGE) mineralization are also examined, including the Bushveld deposits (South Africa), Great Dyke (Zimbabwe), Córrego Bom Sucesso (Brazil), Dominican Republic, Rhine River (Germany), and the Witwatersrand paleoplacers (South Africa). No evidence was found for the growth of distinct PGM larger than about 1–5 µm in the surficial environment. The reactivity of the different PGM varies in relation to their mineral chemistry and depends on local environmental conditions (Eh, pH, temperature, solutes) and is possibly aided by bacterial activity. The order of decreasing stability in the supergene environment is: (1) very stable: Pt–Fe alloys, Os-Ir alloys and Os-rich laurite/erlichmanite → (2) stable: sperrylite → (3) variably stable/“meta-stable”: cooperite/braggite → (4) unstable: PGE-(bismutho-) tellurides and PGE-sulfarsenides. Nano- to micrometer-sized grains or small crystallites of authigenic PGM are different to the more common and significant resistate PGM and consist of native platinum and Pt-Pd alloys with ≈< 5 at. % Fe, or Pt-Fe-Ni-rich alloys, predominantly sited on precursor PGM or locked in small veins or in chromite. Under some conditions, microorganisms may play a role in the destruction of primary PGM but have not been proven to form authigenic PGM. It is concluded that grains or nuggets of Pt-Fe alloys in placers are always allogenic constituents and originate from primary magmatic mineralization, as is also the case for Ru-Os-Ir alloys, laurite-erlichmanite and sperrylite grains. Growth of larger millimeter-size crystals or nuggets has never been observed under ambient conditions and proof of PGM “neoformation” to any significant degree is lacking. The missing link, a look into the cradle of PGM creation in the supergene environment, remains outstanding.","","article","","144","","","Origin and depositional history of platinum-group minerals in placers – A critical review of facts and fiction","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136822000415","0169-1368","2022","104733","Ore Geology Reviews"

Typical concentrations in freshwater are less than 10 μg l−1 and frequently less than 1 μg l−1. Rarely, much higher concentrations are found, particularly in groundwater. In such areas, more than 10% of wells may be ‘affected’ (defined as those exceeding 50 μg l−1) and in the worst cases, this figure may exceed 90%. Well-known high-As groundwater areas have been found in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, China and Hungary, and more recently in West Bengal (India), Bangladesh and Vietnam. The scale of the problem in terms of population exposed to high As concentrations is greatest in the Bengal Basin with more than 40 million people drinking water containing ‘excessive’ As. These large-scale ‘natural’ As groundwater problem areas tend to be found in two types of environment: firstly, inland or closed basins in arid or semi-arid areas, and secondly, strongly reducing aquifers often derived from alluvium. Both environments tend to contain geologically young sediments and to be in flat, low-lying areas where groundwater flow is sluggish. Historically, these are poorly flushed aquifers and any As released from the sediments following burial has been able to accumulate in the groundwater. Arsenic-rich groundwaters are also found in geothermal areas and, on a more localised scale, in areas of mining activity and where oxidation of sulphide minerals has occurred. The As content of the aquifer materials in major problem aquifers does not appear to be exceptionally high, being normally in the range 1–20 mg kg−1. There appear to be two distinct ‘triggers’ that can lead to the release of As on a large scale. The first is the development of high pH (>8.5) conditions in semi-arid or arid environments usually as a result of the combined effects of mineral weathering and high evaporation rates. This pH change leads either to the desorption of adsorbed As (especially As(V) species) and a range of other anion-forming elements (V, B, F, Mo, Se and U) from mineral oxides, especially Fe oxides, or it prevents them from being adsorbed. The second trigger is the development of strongly reducing conditions at near-neutral pH values, leading to the desorption of As from mineral oxides and to the reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides, also leading to As release. Iron (II) and As(III) are relatively abundant in these groundwaters and SO4 concentrations are small (typically 1 mg l−1 or less). Large concentrations of phosphate, bicarbonate, silicate and possibly organic matter can enhance the desorption of As because of competition for adsorption sites. A characteristic feature of high groundwater As areas is the large degree of spatial variability in As concentrations in the groundwaters. This means that it may be difficult, or impossible, to predict reliably the likely concentration of As in a particular well from the results of neighbouring wells and means that there is little alternative but to analyse each well. Arsenic-affected aquifers are restricted to certain environments and appear to be the exception rather than the rule. In most aquifers, the majority of wells are likely to be unaffected, even when, for example, they contain high concentrations of dissolved Fe.","","article","","17","","","A review of the source, behaviour and distribution of arsenic in natural waters","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292702000185","0883-2927","2002","517-568","Applied Geochemistry"

Significant progress in the understanding of larval transport and connectivity of scallop populations has been achieved in recent years through the use of coupled biophysical modelling in combination with novel population genetics techniques. The assessment of abundance and distribution of scallops stocks has benefitted from recent technological developments, particularly in the fields of acoustics and underwater photography. These developments have led to mapping scallop distributions in relation to bottom type characterisations obtained from multi-beam sonar data, groundtruthed using conventional in situ sampling, including underwater imagery. Underwater cameras have also become more common, replacing conventional fishing gears used for periodic monitoring surveys. Management has increasingly focused on spatial harvesting strategies that recognise the existence of spatial gradients in scallop productivity, the non-random allocation of fishing effort and the large inter-annual variability that is typical of scallop recruitment. The use of management strategy evaluation methods to design harvest control rules that are suited to the fishery specific characteristics, and monitoring capabilities is a promising area of new development.

McFarland","","","","","","10","","https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6989(73)90060-6","Visual pigments were extracted from the retinae of a large and diverse sample (179 species, in 40 families) of tropical marinefishes. By the method of partial bleaching, most of these were found to be retinal-1 pigments, with their maxima tightly grouped between 489 and 502 nm; but a few have λmax at shorter wavelengths. The spectral position of these pigments does not correlate with diurnal or nocturnal activity patterns, nor do closely related species necessarily have similar pigments. In general, the deeper-living species have rhodopsins with λmax at shorter wavelengths, a correlation with the bluer quality of light in deeper water. The spectral distribution of light was measured in air and underwater at a coral atoll. During twilight the underwater spectrum narrows and shifts to shorter wavelengths, as a result of increased absorption of yellow-orange light by the atmosphere. This effect at twilight is unique among the general spectral events that constitute each day. The behavioral patterns of reef fishes make clear the relationships between underwater light and the visual pigments. During evening twilight, there is an orderly sequence, in which the diurnal fishes seek cover, and then, after a “Quiet Period”, the nocturnal species emerge. The “Quiet Period” is the most critical and visually difficult time because light intensities are transitional between the thresholds of photopic and scotopic vision. Predation reaches a maximum during the “Quiet Period”. The rhodopsins of all these fishes tend to match the background light available during evening and morning twilight. Photochemically, visual sensitivity is maximized and, as a result, predation is held in check. The relationships between light, behavior and visual physiology are discussed. Although their rhodopsins are spectrally similar to those of the prey, crepuscular predators obtain a visual advantage by having moderate numbers of very large cones, which provide adequate sensitivity and sufficient resolution for motion detection.

The objectives here are to: 1) provide data on changes in human contaminant concentrations and exposure among Canadian Arctic peoples; 2) identify new contaminants of concern; 3) discuss possible health effects; 4) outline risk communication about contaminants in country food; and 5) identify knowledge gaps for future contaminant research and monitoring. The nutritional and cultural benefits of country foods are substantial; however, some dietary studies suggest declines in the amount of country foods being consumed. Significant declines were found for most contaminants in maternal blood over the last 10years within all three Arctic regions studied. Inuit continue to have the highest levels of almost all persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals among the ethnic groups studied. A greater proportion of people in the East exceed Health Canada's guidelines for PCBs and mercury, although the proportion of mothers exceeding these guidelines has decreased since the previous assessment. Further monitoring and research are required to assess trends and health effects of emerging contaminants. Infant development studies have shown possible subtle effects of prenatal exposure to heavy metals and some POPs on immune system function and neurodevelopment. New data suggest important beneficial effects on brain development for Inuit infants from some country food nutrients. The most successful risk communication processes balance the risks and benefits of a diet of country food through input from a variety of regional experts and the community, to incorporate the many socio-cultural and economic factors to arrive at a risk management decision that will be the most beneficial in Arctic communities.","","article","","408","","","Environmental contaminants and human health in the Canadian Arctic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710004559","0048-9697","2010","5165-5234","Science of The Total Environment"

In historical perspective, however, the concept that van der Waals forces may enable breakthrough applications should have been far from controversial. Indeed, it had been a primarily industrial problem—the stability of colloids used in manufacturing—to lead Casimir and Polder to their groundbreaking analyses. For a variety of reasons, including a predictable but somewhat indiscriminate and overreaching reaction against research directions deemed by some to be excessively speculative, such a vision was not immediately embraced. Therefore, widespread recognition of the enabling role of dispersion forces in nanotechnology had to wait till the turn of the present century. Even through uncertainty and confusion regarding the potential for technological applications, however, the subject of Casimir force research in all of its multifaceted ramifications has been growing explosively in the last few decades. The anticipated future of a subset of such activities holding great promise for space technology applications is the subject of this chapter.","","incollection","William Andrew Publishing","","Nanotube Superfiber Materials (Second Edition)","978-0-12-812667-7","Chapter 29 - The Future of van der Waals Force-Enabled Technology Transfer into the Aerospace Marketplace","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012812667700029X","","2019","729-794",""

This becomes even more important in the face of intensifying extreme events. One example of these events is flooding, which embodies a major threat to highly vulnerable coastal urban areas. This includes eastern Asia, where multiple coastal megacities are located, e.g. Shanghai and Shenzhen. While the ability of general circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) to project atmospheric changes associated with these events has improved, systematic errors (biases) remain. This study therefore assess capabilities of improving the quality of regional climate projections for eastern Asia. This is performed by evaluating an ensemble consisting of bias adjustment methods, GCM-RCM model runs and future emission scenarios based on representative concentration pathways (RCP) obtained from EAS-CORDEX. We show that bias adjustment significantly improves the quality of model output and best results are obtained by applying quantile delta mapping. Based on these results we evaluate potential future changes in crucial hydrometeorological predictors, univariate extreme events and compound extreme events, focusing on high wind speeds and extreme precipitation. Key findings include an increase in daily maximum temperature of 1.5 to nearly 4 °C, depending on the scenario, as well as increased levels of precipitation under RCP 8.5. Furthermore, a distinct intensification of extreme events including high temperatures and heavy precipitation is detected and this increase exceeds the increase of the overall mean of these predictors. The annual number of compound events including heavy precipitation and extreme wind speeds shows a significant increase of up to 50% for RCP 8.5 in the South China Sea as well as the adjacent coastal areas.","","article","","39","","","An ensemble-based assessment of bias adjustment performance, changes in hydrometeorological predictors and compound extreme events in EAS-CORDEX","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094722001104","2212-0947","2023","100531","Weather and Climate Extremes"

The neuroendocrine-disrupting effects of TBBPA-DHEE on marine spices, on the other hand, have received little attention. The behavioral, neuroendocrine-disrupting, and possible reproductive toxicity of TBBPA-DHEE were assessed in sexual developing zebrafish treated for 40 days by examining locomotor activity, Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and quantifying gene expression. In addition, transcriptome profiling was carried out to explore the possible mechanisms. According to our findings, TBBPA-DHEE treated zebrafish showed altered locomotor activity, a potential neuroendocrine-disrupting effect via the toxic effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which is evident in decreased levels of GnRH, FSH, and LH, according to our findings. The transcriptomic profiling reveals that a total of 216 DEGs were detected (5 upregulated and 211 down-regulated). Transcriptomic analysis shows that TBBPA-DHEE exposure caused decreased transcript levels of genes (cyp11a1, ccna1, ccnb2, ccnb1, cpeb1b, wee2) involved in cell cycle oocyte meiosis, progesterone mediated oocyte maturation, and ovarian steroidogenesis, which are known reproduction-related pathways.

The high-level goal of the paper is three-fold: to establish a holistic IoT forensics process as a reference point against which blockchain integration patterns and best practices will be identified in order to yield a robust, widely accepted and scalable architecture of the blockchain-enabled solution; to integrate the blockchain with the proposed IoT forensics process for addressing the above challenges; and to evaluate the overall solution highlighting improvements and potential performance bottlenecks. The proposed blockchain-enabled platform leverages multi-access edge computing and has been implemented with Hyperledger Fabric on an extensive virtualized testbed providing a realistic smart home environment.

Unfortunately, GNSS/INS integrated positioning systems are susceptible to state model perturbations and measurement outliers, which can severely degrade KF performance, especially in complex urban environments. To solve this problem, a robust adaptive filtering algorithm based on variational Bayesian (VBRAKF) is presented that can be employed in GNSS/INS tightly coupled positioning systems. In VBRAKF, the robust estimation approach is first introduced into the filter, followed by modeling the predicted covariance matrix using the inverse Wishart distribution, and finally the state is estimated using Variational Bayesian. The robustness is achieved by adjusting the noise by an equivalent weight matrix to reduce gross errors in observations, while the adaptiveness is realized by the variational Bayesian estimation method for the uncertain predicted noise covariance matrix. The positioning performance of the proposed algorithm in urban environments is verified through two sets of land vehicle experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the 3D positioning accuracy of the VBRAKF algorithm is improved by 32.1% and 23.5% in experiment 1 and by 37.1% and 17.3% in experiment 2 when compared to KF and Robust Kalman Filter (RKF). The proposed VBRAKF algorithm has better positioning performance in all schemes, can simultaneously control the influence of measurement outliers and inaccurate noise statistics and improves the accuracy of filter estimation.","","article","","","","","Variational Bayesian-based Robust Adaptive Filtering for GNSS/INS Tightly Coupled Positioning in Urban Environments","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224123012320","0263-2241","2023","113668","Measurement"

The purpose of this study is to reveal the spatio-temporal trend in the long-term time series of extreme rainfall and temperature in Sarawak peatland cause by climate change. Gridded-based Princeton datasets were used for trend analysis spanning 68-year (1948–2016) based on Modified Mann-Kendall (m-MK) test which has the capability of distinguishing unidirectional trend with multi-scale variability. The m-MK test was also used to confirm the increasing or decreasing trend produce by Mann-Kendall (MK), and to discriminate the exaggeration in trend caused by serial auto-correlation due to the high effect of large scale climate events regulating the climate in the region. By using R-based program, RClimDex for extreme climate indices output, extreme climate under Northeast (NE) and Southwest (SW) monsoon showed lower grid point with significant changes under m-MK test compared to MK test at 95% significance level. Here, the exaggeration of trend by MK test has been reduced by using m-MK test which can accommodate the scaling effect in the time series due to inherent natural climate variability. Diurnal temperature range (DTR) was expected to decrease for both monsoons in the central-coastal region as minimum temperature (TN) increased more than maximum temperature (TX). Significant increase in extreme rainfall (R10, R20, Rnn) was spatially observed more during SW monsoon compared to NE monsoon, although with high spatial variability. Significant increase of TN indices of TNn and TN90p might cause increased rainfall intensity in the south and central-coastal region, while high TX indices of TXn might cause increased rainfall intensity in the north. Due to the imminent threat of climate change, this study gives scientists an essential view on the behavior of different extreme climate variables and its potential impact on the peatland area which is susceptible to flood and risk of fire during the NE and SW monsoon, respectively.","","article","","40","","","Long-term trend analysis of extreme climate in Sarawak tropical peatland under the influence of climate change","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094723000075","2212-0947","2023","100554","Weather and Climate Extremes"

The present work aims to map structural patterns and recognise physical layers of the crust over Estonia using global potential models. The gravimetric data was used to identify the depth of the Moho and Conrad discontinuities. The magnetic data has been processed to calculate the Curie point depth (CPD), which was then used to estimate heat flow (HF) values in the study area. The depth of the Moho indicates an average value of 60 km, while the average depth of the Conrad discontinuity is around 18 Km. The depth of the CPD reveals an average value of 15 km.

Furthermore, differences in average chain length (ACL) and carbon preference index (CPI) suggest that these plant communities are highly adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The sum of leaf wax n-alkanes was highest under wet conditions, while n-alkanoic acids (between n-C24 and n-C28) increased with hyperaridity. Similarly, analysis of n-alkane time series from palaeomiddens showed that the greatest changes in leaf wax n-alkane distributions (ACL and CPI) corresponded to the greatest increases in moisture during the Central Andean Pluvial Event (CAPE; between 18 and 9 ka cal BP) and the Late Holocene. The shift in the palaeomidden n-alkane distributions is corroborated by the relative abundance of rainfall-dependent extra-local taxa.

In this study, PM2.5-associated excess mortality in Equatorial Asia over the past 30 years (1990–2019) was estimated and then the health effect of biomass burning was identified. The PM2.5-related death in Equatorial Asia almost tripled from 113 (95% confidence interval, 100–125) thousand in 1990 to 337 (300–373) thousand in 2019, with a rate of increase of 6.4 (6.2–6.9) thousand/yr.

Although the remote sensing data and emission inventories both reveal that the effective control measures have reduced biomass burning intensity in Equatorial Asia (especially in Sumatra and Borneo), the corresponding health benefit has been offset by variations in demographic factors, i.e., population and age structure. Over the same period, fossil fuel emissions continued to increase rapidly. Thus, more stringent and ambitious policies are required to reduce the health burden from biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions simultaneously to maximize the health benefits from government measures and policies.","","article","","330","","","Effect of biomass burning on premature mortality associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5 in Equatorial Asia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147972202727X","0301-4797","2023","117154","Journal of Environmental Management"

However, these studies ignore EOS scheduling for moving targets (EOSSMT), which is urgently needed in many situations. EOSSMT is more complicated due to two factors, 1) location prediction of the moving targets and 2) algorithm design of EOSSMT optimization model for highly-nonlinear characteristics. In this article, we present a novel continuous monitoring scheduling methodology for moving targets by EOSs. Firstly, in order to predict the location of moving targets, a prediction-capture method, which can calculate the capture probability (CP) of the targets, is proposed. Then, based on the concept CP, we regard the EOSSMT as a stochastic integer nonlinear programming problem. Aiming to maximize observation times and duration, two objective functions with low complexity are proposed correspondingly. Finally, to solve our highly-nonlinear optimization model more efficiently, a dispersion-based heuristic (DBH) is proposed. In the computational experiments, a number of instances (scenarios), in which moving targets are successfully observed, verify the correctness and efficiency of our novel methodology for EOSSMT. Computational experiments also show that DBH can achieve better results than the Genetic Algorithm and Greedy Algorithm, with significantly less algorithm complexity.","","article","","140","","","Continuous monitoring scheduling for moving targets by Earth observation satellites","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S127096382300319X","1270-9638","2023","108422","Aerospace Science and Technology"

Motivated by the continuous development of automatic image captioning, more and more deep learning methods have been proposed for automatic radiology report generation. However, the visual and textual data bias problem still face many challenges in the medical domain. Additionally, do not integrate medical knowledge, ignoring the mutual influences between medical findings, and abundant unlabeled medical images influence the accuracy of generating report. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge with Contrastive Learning model (MKCL) to enhance radiology report generation. The proposed model MKCL uses IU Medical Knowledge Graph (IU-MKG) to mine the relationship among medical findings and improve the accuracy of identifying positive diseases findings from radiologic medical images. In particular, we design Knowledge Enhanced Attention (KEA), which integrates the IU-MKG and the extracted chest radiological visual features to alleviate textual data bias. Meanwhile, this paper leverages supervised contrastive learning to relieve radiographic medical images which have not been labeled, and identify abnormalities from images. Experimental results on the public dataset IU X-ray show that our proposed model MKCL outperforms other state-of-the-art report generation methods.

In this paper, a reliability evaluation method based on semi-Markov process is proposed and applied to the hybrid-redundancy sensor fault tolerant (HRSFT) system within the perception system of a cutter suction dredger (CSD). The method takes into account the harsh operating environment of the CSD sensor, and considers the temporal occurrence of sensor faults as well as the imperfection of the sensor fault diagnosis and isolation (SFDI). The outcomes of the model applied to a case study indicate that three key factors, namely, the failure rate of the sensors, the false alarm rate (FAR) of the SFDI system and the self-correction rate (SCR) of the HRSFT system, have a significant impact on the system reliability. Additionally, we performed a comparative analysis between the HRSFT and Double Redundancy Sensor Fault Tolerant (DRSFT) systems, from which the superiority of the HRSFT system in terms of reliability is demonstrated. A series of experiments were conducted with varying parameters values, to show the high adaptability of the model to the HRSFT system.","","article","","281","","","Reliability evaluation of the hybrid-redundancy sensor fault tolerate system in the dredging perception system","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823012283","0029-8018","2023","114844","Ocean Engineering"

This event was associated with an upper-level trough over the western Mediterranean basin, a large-scale configuration typical of heavy precipitation phenomena on the southern side of the Alps, since it induces a northward transport of large amounts of moisture impinging on the orography. The present study shows that a relevant amount of moisture moved towards the Mediterranean basin in the form of an atmospheric river (AR), a long and narrow filament-shaped structure crossing the whole Atlantic Ocean, characterized in the present case by a maximum Integrated Vapour Transport exceeding 1000 kg m−1 s−1. Therefore, in addition to the local contribution from the Mediterranean Sea, a relevant amount of moisture moved from the Tropics towards the Mediterranean, feeding the precipitation systems. The presence of an AR represented a distinguishing aspect of the event, superimposed on the well-known dynamic-thermodynamic mechanisms of heavy precipitation over the Alps. High-resolution numerical simulations and diagnostic tools have been exploited to investigate in detail how the transport of water vapour associated with the AR has influenced the dynamics and favoured the severity of the heavy precipitation processes. The results disclose the role of the AR and add further details to the theoretical framework of heavy precipitation mechanisms in the Alpine area, improving our understanding of the complex interaction between large-scale flows and mesoscale dynamics during extreme precipitation episodes. Due to the relatively fast evolution of the synoptic disturbance, the typical mesoscale mechanisms would have led only to an ordinary intense rainfall event. The contribution of the AR turned the event into a devastating flood.","","article","","39","","","The influence of an atmospheric river on a heavy precipitation event over the western Alps","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094722001219","2212-0947","2023","100542","Weather and Climate Extremes"

Trace elements, released to environment due to industrial, agricultural and urban activities, are of special concern due to their non-degradability, persistence, bioaccumulation in organisms and potential toxicity. Reliable methods for assessing the level of pollution are essential for proper monitoring and control of pollution. A useful tool for this purpose is the geochemical background (GB), which enables to differentiate between unpolluted and polluted areas as well as calculate pollution indices. The study presents the first attempt to estimate the background values for aquatic plants using cosmopolitan submerged aquatic macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum as a model species. Water and plant samples were collected from 117 water bodies. Contents of 15 elements (As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry and flame photometry. Four methods were tested for estimation of the background concentrations: Median ± 2Median Absolute Deviation, Iterative 2σ technique, Tukey box-plot, Grouping of data with 60 % coefficient of variation (CV). Wide ranges of element concentrations in water and various values of Contamination Factor indicated to a variety of natural and anthropogenic impacts in the studied area, which confirmed that the database covered a real environmental variability. Very different estimates of background concentrations were obtained depending on the method. The highest background values were usually given by Me±2MAD method. Grouping of data with 60 % CV was most exigent in defining a site as undisturbed, therefore this method was recommended as the most suitable for estimation of the background values for C. demersum. Pollution Load Index validated the use of estimated background concentrations as reliable for bioindication of pollution in aquatic reservoirs.","","article","","899","","","Estimation of background concentrations of macro- and trace elements in an aquatic plant as a basis for the passive biomonitoring of pollution","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723042754","0048-9697","2023","165652","Science of The Total Environment"

Environmental conditions such as water depth, flow velocities and grain size vary across entire shelf regions, consequently influencing the characteristics of tidal sand waves, including migration rates. However, as opposed to site-specific analyses, shelf sea-wide analyses on sand wave migration are scarce. Through the use of timeseries of bathymetric data, we investigate the spatial variability of sand wave migration on the scale of the Netherlands Continental Shelf (NCS). Two existing data-driven techniques, Pairs of Source and Target Points (PSTP) and Spatial Cross Correlation (SCC), were implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Through testing at four sites on the NCS, PSTP was deemed the preferred technique for a shelf-wide analysis and was hence used to quantify the NCS-wide migration rates and directions. To illustrate the spatial variability, the quantified migration rates and directions were averaged per km2. For the NCS in general, migration to the south-west or north-east at typical rates between 0 and 3 m/year was found. The south-western region of the NCS demonstrated migration rates below 0.5 m/year with migration directions alternating over short distances. The north-eastern region exhibited uniform migration to the north-east at rates which gradually increased when in closer proximity to the Wadden Islands. Typical rates in this region were found to be between 2 and 8 m/year. The highest migration rates were observed near coastal regions and on top of sandbanks. The presence of these sandbanks strongly deflects the migration directions of superimposed sand waves at a number of locations. The analysis performed within this study demonstrates valuable insights into methods that can be used to evaluate shelf-wide regions of interest. A deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of the North Sea bed assists in optimising hydrographic re-survey policies, critical infrastructure planning and subsequent monitoring. Furthermore, this study may offer a wider set of tools that could be used for correlating sand wave migration to its governing physical mechanisms and environmental parameters.","","article","","424","","","Shelf-wide analyses of sand wave migration using GIS: A case study on the Netherlands Continental Shelf","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X22004524","0169-555X","2023","108559","Geomorphology"

The wind surge travels from the mid-north coast of Spain to France, generally reaching their maximum intensity at the Basque Coast, and cuts off a period of hot weather, clear skies, and calm conditions at sea. The galernas have a large history of shipwrecks and fishermen deaths. They have been characterized as coastally trapped disturbances (CTD) and their propagation, enhanced with the local formation of a micro-front, was documented to behave like a density current. Alternatively, synoptic fronts have also been reported to cause galernas, considered to be more intense than those generated by a local micro-front. In this article we have generated the first climatology (2003–2020) of these events based on an objective identification methodology. The developed Event Identification Software (EIS), based on both 10-min surface station data and hourly ERA5 reanalysis fields, together with a new Front Identification Scheme (FIS) have enabled a deeper study into the origin and development of these micro-fronts, and a more comprehensive exploration of the interaction of the oceanic fronts entering the Bay of Biscay. Our results show that the area receives an average of four to five relatively intense galernas (Vmax > 50 km h−1) per year. Their number shows a great interannual variability (from one to seven) and a marked seasonality: May and June concentrate the largest fraction (almost one episode each year) and practically no episodes in winter. They occur more frequently between noon and the late afternoon, where the most intense wind records concentrate. Very strong galernas (Vmax > 72 km h−1) have occurred in all 18 years, can happen in any month from February to November, and their monthly distribution does not show the mentioned seasonality. On the contrary, the highest rates of temperature decrease across the galerna front in the coastal stations (−∆T/0.5 h > 4 °C) do have a stronger seasonality, with May and June concentrating a relatively large number of cases with a more abrupt temperature drop. The FIS shows that most of the galernas (83.5%) have a local origin inside the Bay of Biscay, and only a few ones (16.5%) are caused by oceanic fronts initiated out of the region. The local frontogenesis is more frequently initiated by the relatively cold marine southwesterly pre-frontals preceding a parent oceanic front and blowing against the warm continentals inside the Bay of Biscay, after being ducted along the north and northwestern coast of Spain. This hidden local frontogenesis, first revealed by the FIS, seems to be enhanced by the observed lee troughing, which could have both a thermal and dynamic origin, acting simultaneously after the intense Foehn at the coastal strip, preceding the formation of the galerna front. The local front enhancement appears to be the reason for the apparent jump of the primary front, which may eventually weaken, and even disappear, as the galerna front sharpens. Even during the more occasional frontal galernas, directly caused by the westerlies or north-westerlies behind the oceanic front, their eastward propagation is more rapid over the coastal area. The front deforms in shape and may cause its characteristic unexpected/abrupt irruption. All the EIS detected galernas, even the frontal ones, are wind reversals caused by a coastally trapped marine boundary layer. The upper-level ridge over Europe, observed in all of them, seems to be a synoptic ingredient for their development, preventing the eastward propagation of Atlantic depressions and enhancing at the same time the temperature and pressure gradients between the marine and continental air masses.","","article","","281","","","Galernas: A history of coastally trapped disturbances (2003−2020) with hidden frontogenesis in the Bay of Biscay","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809522004793","0169-8095","2023","106493","Atmospheric Research"

Macroscopic Charcoal Accumulation Rates (CHAR), a proxy of past local fires, shows a geographic variation that mirrors the modern north-to-south and low-to-high elevation increase in annual precipitation and decrease in precipitation seasonality, and the frequency of explosive volcanic events. Variability in past fires is evident at multiple timescales, with a significant multi-millennial low between ∼18–13.1 ka, an abrupt rise between ∼13.1–12.5 ka, and heightened fire activity between ∼11.4–8.2 ka with significant high values between ∼10–9.4 ka. A subsequent decline led to the lowest Holocene values between ∼6–5.4 ka, which rose and led to significant high values between ∼3.1 ka and the present. Andean and Western Upwind Environments share a multi-millennial structure of fire activity since ∼18 ka, overprinted by millennial and centennial-scale divergences. These differences underscore the role of explosive volcanism as a trigger or modulator of fire activity in the vicinity of Andean eruptive centers. We posit that fire activity in Western Upwind Environments was driven primarily by hydroclimate variations, namely changes in the intensity of the Southern Westerly Winds. Compilations of CHAR and the Rates of Change (ROC) parameter, a measure of the magnitude and rapidity of changes in the pollen records, covary during the onset of the interglacial fire regime at ∼13.1 ka and the last ∼4000 years, suggesting that fires catalyzed vegetation changes during specific intervals since the last glaciation. Highly mobile human occupations deployed along the coasts started at ∼6.2 ka, increased in pulses, and spread widely during the last two millennia. Covariation with CHAR and ROC since ∼4 ka suggests that hunter-gatherer-fishers contributed to enhanced fire activity and abrupt vegetation changes at regional scale. The ubiquitous fire maximum over the last four centuries relates to widespread settlement and associated large-scale land clearance conducted by European/Chilean settlers.","","article","","300","","","Fires and rates of change in the temperate rainforests of northwestern Patagonia since ∼18 ka","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379122005303","0277-3791","2023","107899","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Previous studies on the QTP mainly focused on the spatial distribution of precipitation and its changing trend. To investigate the temporal and spatial variations of precipitation variability on the QTP, this study applied the standardized variability index (SVI) based on entropy on its daily precipitation without any preset distribution. The results showed that for most monsoon months in the past 40 years, SVI has a significant downward trend in the southwest foot of the Himalayas and the border zone between barren and grassland areas, indicating that precipitation has become more uniform, which is beneficial for growth of grassland. However, the Hurst exponent shows that such trend will reverse in the future, which may cause natural disasters such as landslides and debris flows in the monsoon period considering the large amount of precipitation and the local topographic conditions in the southwest of the Himalayan foothills. The inducements of such precipitation variability were also studied, including Asian monsoon, westerly jets, sea-land thermal difference, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Compared with the monsoon index, the sea-land thermal difference has a stronger correlation with the precipitation variability. The SST anomaly closer to the east coast of the equatorial Pacific also has a great impact on the variability of precipitation over the plateau. This study contributes to understanding precipitation variability in the QTP at a sub-seasonal period.","","article","","619","","","Reasons behind seasonal and monthly precipitation variability in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas during 1979∼2017","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169423002718","0022-1694","2023","129329","Journal of Hydrology"

In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.","","article","","295","","","Long-term observation of global nuclear power plants thermal plumes using Landsat images and deep learning","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723002584","0034-4257","2023","113707","Remote Sensing of Environment"

This phenomenon can lead to large errors when it comes to modelling and remote sensing-based estimation of SM. While the effect of subsurface scattering and its influence on SM estimates is well described and modelled in literature, its actual presence in recorded SAR data is largely unknown. Here we investigate the relation between C-Band SAR backscatter and SM in the hyper-arid environment of the Atacama Desert (Chile). Time series (2018–2020) of Sentinel-1 VV/VH intensities are compared to in situ SM, measured at 17 stations located across the Atacama Desert. Linear and non-linear regression modelling is applied to uncover the relationship between the SAR intensities and in situ SM, while, in addition, SM variations triggered by seasonal varying humidity (i.e., not by precipitation) are investigated. Results indicate (i) a very weak linear relationship between SM variations and SAR intensities (VV/VH) for most meteorological stations in the Atacama (R2 < 0.5). In particular, noticeable and significant exceptions are found for stations located in the northern uplands of the Coastal Cordillera and on sediments, which are characterized by thick atmospheric dust deposits on top of subsurface cemented crusts; (ii) over these sites a strong inverse linear relationship is present (R2 up to 0.84) and the observable seasonal variations in SAR intensity are linked to the seasonal variations in SM; (iii) remarkably low changes in SM (ranging from approx. 1 to 3%) lead to comparable high changes in SAR intensity (up to 5.5 dB in VH and up to 4.0 dB in VV); (iv) employing a non-linear regression modelling to the SAR time series allowed identifying the occurrence and the strength of seasonal variations over the central desert. This study contributes to a better understanding of SAR scattering over arid to hyper-arid soils, indicates a moisture-regulated complex interplay of surface and subsurface scattering, and proves the presence of subsurface scattering effects in Sentinel-1C-Band data to occur over large parts of the Atacama Desert.","","article","","285","","","Exploring Sentinel-1 backscatter time series over the Atacama Desert (Chile) for seasonal dynamics of surface soil moisture","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722005193","0034-4257","2023","113413","Remote Sensing of Environment"

A. distans increased shortly after ∼16.4 ka and achieved maximum abundance between ∼15.4-13.6 ka, while A. granulata disappeared at ∼15.8 ka and A. alpigena rose at ∼14.9 ka to its maximum between ∼13-12 ka.

Subsequent changes include increases of A. distans with D. stelligera between ∼7.8-5.8 ka, dominance of the former between ∼5.8-3.3 ka, a rapid increase in A. perglabra at ∼3.3 ka, and ensuing diversification of benthic acidophilous species. We infer a rapid lake-level decline between ∼11-7.8 ka, with subsequent rising pulses at ∼7.8 ka and ∼5.8 ka, a multimillennial-scale lake acidification trend, and overall high lake levels with centennial-scale reversals between ∼6-0 ka.

Oil, heavy metals, agrochemicals, sewage, medical wastes, plastics, algal blooms, atmospheric pollutants, mariculture-related pollutants, as well as thermal and noise pollution are the most threatening marine pollutants. The release of these pollutants into the marine aquatic environment leads to significant ecological degradation and a range of non-infectious disorders in fish. Marine pollutants trigger numerous fish bacterial diseases by increasing microbial multiplication in the aquatic environment and suppressing fish immune defense mechanisms. The greater part of these microorganisms is naturally occurring in the aquatic environment. Most disease outbreaks are caused by opportunistic bacterial agents that attack stressed fish. Some infections are more serious and occur in the absence of environmental stressors. Gram-negative bacteria are the most frequent causes of these epizootics, while gram-positive bacterial agents rank second on the critical pathogens list. Vibrio spp., Photobacterium damselae subsp. Piscicida, Tenacibaculum maritimum, Edwardsiella spp., Streptococcus spp., Renibacterium salmoninarum, Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., and Mycobacterium spp. Are the most dangerous pathogens that attack fish in polluted marine aquatic environments. Effective management strategies and stringent regulations are required to prevent or mitigate the impacts of marine pollutants on aquatic animal health. This review will increase stakeholder awareness about marine pollutants and their impacts on aquatic animal health. It will support competent authorities in developing effective management strategies to mitigate marine pollution, promote the sustainability of commercial marine fisheries, and protect aquatic animal health.","","article","","344","","","The role of marine pollution on the emergence of fish bacterial diseases","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565352302636X","0045-6535","2023","140366","Chemosphere"

The contaminated soils and aquifer are located in the Matano formation (Sulawesi, Indonesia). Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was used to detect and delineate Pb-contaminated soils (i.e., solid-phase Pb). Lead in the solid and aqueous phase have different characteristics and responses when subjected to electromagnetic (EM) waves. Many studies have used GPR to map solid-phase Pb contamination in the subsurface. GPR uses EM as the base medium to receive subsurface images and is useful for the detection of solid-phase Pb contamination but cannot detect aqueous-phase Pb. The first step in the remediation process was to delineate solid-phase Pb contamination in the subsurface using GPR, which required a geotechnical survey to support GPR. Samples of soil and aquifer solids were then taken to quantify lead concentrations using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). We collected 15 lines of GPR measurements and 11 soil samples to quantify Pb. Frequencies of 600 MHz and 900 MHz were used for the GPR antenna. The results identified a clay layer at a depth of between 3 m and 4 m, which appears to have served as barrier to downward migration of Pb-contaminated groundwater. A shadow zone and low reflectance in the GPR subsurface section images were used to identify as the Pb contamination, which has a distinct wavelength ranging between 0.36 m and 0.45 m. We conclude from the results of this study that GPR was an effective tool for the delineation of the vertical and horizontal spread of Pb contamination eastward from the source.","","article","","14","","","Case study of ground penetration radar (GPR) to assess lead migration","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666828923000056","2666-8289","2023","100055","Results in Geophysical Sciences"

However, this is not a straightforward task due to three main difficulties: temporal autocorrelation, spatial dependency, and concept drift caused by virus mutations and lockdown policies. Although machine learning has been extensively used in related work, no previous research has successfully addressed all three challenges simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel online multi-task regression algorithm that incorporates a chain structure to capture spatial dependency, the ADWIN drift detector to adapt to concept drift, and the lag time series feature to capture temporal autocorrelation. We conducted several comparative experiments based on the number of daily confirmed cases in 20 areas in California and affiliated cities. The results from our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is superior in adapting to concept drift in COVID-19 data and capturing spatial dependencies across various regions.

The absorption and scattering of light in real underwater scenes leads to severe information degradation in the acquired underwater images, thus limiting further development of underwater tasks. To solve these problems, a novel transformer-based perceptual contrastive network for underwater image enhancement methods (TPC-UIE) is proposed to achieve visually friendly and high-quality images, where contrastive learning is applied to the underwater image enhancement (UIE) task for the first time. Specifically, to address the limitations of the pure convolution-based network, we embed the transformer into the UIE network to improve its ability to capture global dependencies. Then, the limits of the transformer are then taken into account as convolution is reintroduced to better capture local attention. At the same time, the dual-attention module strengthens the network’s focus on the spatial and color channels that are more severely attenuated. Finally, a perceptual contrastive regularization method is proposed, where a multi-loss function made up of reconstruction loss, perceptual loss, and contrastive loss jointly optimizes the model to simultaneously ensure texture detail, contrast, and color consistency. Experimental results on several existing datasets show that the TPC-UIE obtains excellent performance in both subjective and objective evaluations compared to other methods. In addition, the visual quality of the underwater images is significantly improved by the enhancement of the method and effectively facilitates further development of the underwater task.","","article","","118","","","A transformer-based network for perceptual contrastive underwater image enhancement","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923596523001145","0923-5965","2023","117032","Signal Processing: Image Communication"

These studies have reinforced the robustness of increases in TC intensity and associated TC hazards and risks due to anthropogenic climate change. New modeling and observational studies suggested the potential influence of anthropogenic climate forcings, including greenhouse gases and aerosols, on global and regional TC activity at the decadal and century time scales. However, there are still substantial uncertainties owing to model uncertainty in simulating historical TC decadal variability in the Atlantic, and the limitations of observed TC records. The projected future change in the global number of TCs has become more uncertain since IWTC-9 due to projected increases in TC frequency by a few climate models. A new paradigm, TC seeds, has been proposed, and there is currently a debate on whether seeds can help explain the physical mechanism behind the projected changes in global TC frequency. New studies also highlighted the importance of large-scale environmental fields on TC activity, such as snow cover and air-sea interactions.

However, in practice, they often suffer from poor performance and require complex configurations because network packets must be ‘detoured’ to each virtualized security service, which expends bandwidth and increases network propagation delay. To address these challenges, we propose a new SDN-based data plane architecture, called DPX (Data Plane eXtension), that natively supports in-network security services. The DPX action model reduces redundant processing caused by frequent packet parsing and provides administrators with a simplified (and less error-prone) method for configuring security services into the network. DPX also increases the efficiency of enforcing complex security policies by introducing a novel technique called action clustering, which aggregates security actions from multiple flows into a small number of synthetic rules. Also, the application of action clustering (i.e., advanced and global) provides more diverse policies and network-wide detection. We present an implementation of DPX in hardware using NetFPGA-SUME and in software using Open vSwitch. We evaluate the performance of the DPX prototype and the efficacy of its flow-table simplifications against a range of complex network policies exposed to line rates of 10 Gbps.","","article","","124","","","Extended data plane architecture for in-network security services in software-defined networks","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404822003686","0167-4048","2023","102976","Computers & Security"

The European sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) is a critically endangered diadromous fish and its marine habitat preferences are unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate key variables driving A. sturio distribution and predict its current distribution in inshore waters along the European Atlantic coast. We developed two correlative SDM in A. sturio marine habitats based on incidental observations (2012–2021) and two different sets of environmental predictors. In both attempts, six methods which differ according to the biases they aim to reduce (i.e. oversampled areas or environmental conditions, dependence between calibration and validation datasets) and the input dataset used (i.e. random pseudo-absences or target-group pseudo-absences) were applied at various stages of the model building and evaluation process. By comparing potentially biased and bias-corrected predictions, we found similar satisfactory level of evaluation and spatial patterns of habitat suitability. Marine areas predicted as the most suitable were distributed along the French Atlantic coast, the Seine and Somme bays, and at a lesser extent around the Rhine delta and in some coastal areas of the Cantabrian Sea (Northern Spain). We found a strong influence of the bathymetry, temperature, and salinity as well as an influence of the bottom current velocity and of the distance to the source population in explaining A. sturio marine distribution, while the nature of the substrate was not retained by the models. Results of this study could pave the way toward more integrated conservation measures for this critically endangered fish.","","article","","280","","","Developing species distribution models for critically endangered species using participatory data: The European sturgeon marine habitat suitability","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771422003948","0272-7714","2023","108136","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science"

As the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, China has taken coal-to-gas as an important measure to reduce GHG emissions, and has become the world's largest LNG importer. Studying the patterns and characteristics of China's LNG trade is of great significance for ensuring energy supply security, formulating and adjusting energy strategies. However, the refined analysis of China's LNG trade is still inadequate, mainly due to the lack of research on the details of ship trajectories and port attributes. Therefore, a “ship-port-country” multidimensional LNG trade analysis method is proposed to improve the timeliness, multi-dimensionality and fineness of China's LNG trade analysis. The multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade are analyzed by studying the big data of nearly 3.5 billion automatic identification system (AIS) records in 2017. The study has found that (1) The arrival frequency of China's LNG trading ships varies greatly with time. For example, the most frequent daily arrivals are between 04:00 and 05:00 in the morning, while the least frequent arrivals are between 15:00 and 17:00 in the afternoon. (2) The Chinese LNG trade network consisting of 79 ports has been formed, of which NANTONG Port is the most important port. (3) The LNG trade volume calculated in this study has shown a strong correlation with the national LNG trade statistics and can be used to analyze LNG trade with higher spatial and temporal resolution. According to the characteristics of LNG trade at the three levels of ship, port and country, China can optimize its LNG trade policy from the following aspects: (1) Dynamically allocate port resources according to the arrival frequency of LNG tankers to reduce port congestion and waste of resources. (2) Expand core LNG trading ports such as NANTONG Port, ZHOUSHAN Port, TANGSHAN (JINGTANG) Port, XIUYU Port, DALIAN Port and LUSHUN Port. (3) Actively realize the diversification of LNG trading partners to reduce the dependence of LNG import sources on one country or region, and ensure energy security. The “ship-port-country” multi-level LNG trade analysis method proposed in this study provides a new research perspective for the analysis of the LNG trade pattern. This study reveals the multidimensional characteristics of China's LNG trade, which can provide decision-making support for China to formulate reasonable LNG trade policies and energy security policies, and is conducive to the stable and sustainable development of global LNG trade.","","article","","110","","","“Ship-port-country” multi-dimensional research on the fine analysis of China's LNG trade","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692323000911","0966-6923","2023","103619","Journal of Transport Geography"

Statistical and domain-knowledge methods were used to select the proper input variables for the models. These methods prevent over-fitting, missing data, and multicollinearity while providing practical applicability.

Touchless and nonverbal interfaces are a subset of these in which the user can interact with robots without the use of buttons, speech, or other physical methods. The two driving forces behind the development of these methods are the desire for more natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and the need for more efficacious assistive technologies. Many interface methods inspired by natural human interaction can improve HRIs. These include gaze/eye contact, emotion detection, and gesture recognition. Assistive robot systems can efficiently utilize these methods, as well as other interfaces that are uncommon in human interactions. These includes several unexplored methods such as biopotential signals, the electroencephalogram (EEG) being one example. Research is also underway in exploring the use of involuntary or subconscious signals in human interaction, such as lie detection or behavior analysis. This paper compiles research findings in several of these areas and discusses the benefits, limitations, and potential for future development in several essential touchless and nonverbal human-robot interface methods. This includes a discussion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices as they relate to how robot systems can gather information through the use of sensors. The paper also examines cognitive robots and explores possible advancements that can be explored in this area using next-generation mobile networking (5G and 6G) to allow for high data transfer rates, highlighting important information gathered by robots through different interfacing methods.

However, scientific information is lacking on most aspects of this fishery which is essential for its sustainable management. In this context, this study aimed to provide the first characterization of the hand-operated dredges fishery; evaluate the damage of this fishery on the megabenthic fauna; and analyze the impact of the fishing activity on the wedge clam. Our results indicate that landings declined dramatically since the mid-1990s and the main causes for this decline are postulated. Fishing effort was highly seasonal, being more intense from March to September. The discard fraction was very small (5.74% in abundance and the 3.74% in biomass) and 61.93% of the discards did not suffer damage.

This paper aims at filling the gap by conceptualizing a DT-enhanced BIM framework from the perspective of bridge engineering. In total, 116 documents on BIM and DT were reviewed, compared, and analyzed; a crucial metrics based performance hierarchy for bridge digital twin was concluded and a DT-enhanced BIM framework was proposed to promote full lifecycle digital bridge engineering implementation.

Recently, several studies have been conducted on the efficiency contactless Terahertz technique (THz) to map the water content. In this study, this technique based on coupling infrared camera and developed Tera-Thermo-Converter, is used for the estimation of mass diffusion coefficient within hygroscopic materials initially dry. A water vapour water content excitation device is designed to excite the samples in a THz semitransparent enclosure during the monitoring. The recorded infrared films showed a pronounced mitigation of the signal over time, indicating penetration of vapour through the sample. Processing image techniques such as the four-image, algorithm and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and averaging are used to obtain the space-time water content map. A simplified one-dimensional model of mass transfer is proposed to estimate the diffusion coefficient using two inverse methods: a) a statistical method based on Bayesian approach, and b) a minimization method based on Levenberg‒Marquardt algorithm (LM). The results showed that THz imaging technique coupled with the appropriate processing and the adequate modelling, is able not only to map the water content field but also to monitor the transient transfer and estimate the diffusion coefficient without contact.","","article","","208","","","Estimation of the diffusion coefficient of hygroscopic materials using a contactless transient THz water vapour content imaging and excitation device","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001793102300217X","0017-9310","2023","124064","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer"

To the scope, gross α and gross β activities at ground-level air were weekly recorded from 2006 to 2021, by collecting aerosol filters and successively analysing them by low-level proportional counting. Time series decomposition shows a strong correlation between the seasonal components of gross α and gross β and the local meteorological parameters, in particular temperature and wind speed. Back trajectories reaching the study area during the sampling, calculated at three height levels (750 m, 1500 m, and 3000 m a.s.l.), were analysed by three methods with the aim to determine the main characteristics of air masses reaching Granada, and their impact on airborne radioactivity levels. The results of the residence time and clustering analyses showed that an increase in the radioactivity levels in the southeast of Spain is connected with air masses coming from the Mediterranean at 750 m and from the South (Sahara Desert) at 3000 m. In line with the outcomes obtained by the cluster analysis, the Concentration Weighted Trajectory (WCWT) results highlight that the air masses transported from Mediterranean and African regions are a potential source of gross α and gross β.

During the historical period from 1982 to 2014, the WNP region experiences an average MHW frequency of 0.89 ± 0.18 count/year. These events have an average duration of 8.64 ± 1.39 days/count. Annually, the cumulative MHW days amount to 7.76 ± 2.23 days, with an accumulated intensity of 15.73 ± 6.43 °C days. The maximum intensity recorded during this period reaches 2.04 ± 0.54 °C, while the average intensity stands at 1.74 ± 0.48 °C/count. In the evaluation of 14 CMIP6 models, five optimal models, namely GFDL-ESM4, EC-Earth3-Veg, EC-Earth3, BCC-CSM2-MR, and MRI-ESM2-0, are selected for simulating future MHWs. Based on the simulation results of these five models under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios for the future period (2015–2100), it is found that under the SSP2-4.5, the frequency of MHWs is slightly higher compared to the SSP5-8.5. However, under the SSP5-8.5, MHWs exhibit higher accumulated intensity, maximum intensity, and average intensity, with a predominance of high-intensity MHWs in the Kuroshio Extension region. The occurrence area ratio in the future is significantly larger than in the historical period. Moreover, MHWs intensity displays a seasonal variation, with stronger during summer and weaker during winter. This study provides important insights into MHWs in the WNP region, offering valuable information for decision-makers in formulating response measures and reducing economic losses.","","article","","200","","","Marine heatwaves in the Western North Pacific Region: Historical characteristics and future projections","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063723002005","0967-0637","2023","104161","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

It is home to several endemic coral species and a site of cetaceous reproduction. Like any other reef ecosystem worldwide, it experiences multiple disturbances associated with increasing sea surface temperatures, El Niño events, and, most recently, oil spill pollution. In addition to these global stressors, the Abrolhos region may have been impacted by coastal human interventions, a large-scale mining disaster, floods, and extra-tropical cyclones that affected the region during the last 20 years. Among these stressors, the Fundão dam collapse (the largest in the Southern Hemisphere) deserves special attention since it delivered significant amounts of iron tailings to the nearby coast. To investigate the region's recent history, we collected, dated, and performed detailed geochemical and isotopic analyses on two coral colonies (i.e., Siderastrea stellata and Mussismilia harttii), in order to determine if effects of recent human activity on reef systems (and most recent natural impacts) could be detected thorough bioaccumulation of metals in their skeletons. In this context, we detected an abrupt increase in Fe and Mn concentrations in the coral skeleton, which are among the main constituents of the Fundão dam tailings. We show that a concomitant increase in metal concentrations tracks contaminant dispersion of the Fundão dam tailings released to the western South Atlantic. Besides this event, our data also show that coastal dredging activities in the nearby coral reef site (i.e., at the Tomba channel) and two natural episodes (i.e., the flood of 2013 and the anomalous extra-tropical cyclonic activity in 2008) were also recorded in the coral skeleton based on changes in Rare Earth Elements distribution, Rb and U concentrations.","","article","","255","","","Intake of trace contaminants by corals in Abrolhos reef bank (western South Atlantic) during two decades of coastal impacts","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434323000237","0278-4343","2023","104946","Continental Shelf Research"

The results show that the SETP was in a state of serious mass loss (at a rate of −0.35 ± 0.03 m w.e. per year) from the 1970s to 2020, and the rate of mass loss accelerated from −0.15 ± 0.05 to −0.56 ± 0.10 m w.e. per year between the 1970s–2000 and 2000–2020.

Nyainqentanglha exhibited the highest acceleration in the mass loss rate since the 1970s. The warming of air temperature and decreasing snowfall can partly explain the accelerated glacier mass loss in the SETP. The study provides a new long-term glacier mass balance estimation covering almost the entire SETP that suggests the acceleration in glacier mass loss observed in the SETP since the 1970s is a regional tendency, which is crucial for understanding the relationship between glaciers and climate changes.","","article","","14","","","Accelerated glacier mass loss in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau since the 1970s","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674927823000527","1674-9278","2023","372-386","Advances in Climate Change Research"

The Optimized Back Propagation Neural Network (OBPNN) technique used in this study introduces a unique method for monitoring sensor data and evaluating the health state, with the SVM being optimized using the fish swarm algorithm (FSA). A major problem that maintenance is facing nowadays is reliable fault prediction. One of the trickiest difficulties is arguably automatically modelling typical behaviour from condition monitoring data, particularly when there is little information about actual failures. A data-driven learning framework with the best bandwidth selection is suggested to address this challenge. It is based on nonparametric density estimation for outlier identification and OBPNN for normality modelling. The distance to the separating hyper plane's log-normalization is used to provide a health score that is also available. The algorithm's viability is shown by experimental findings while evaluating the progression of a major defect over time in a marine diesel engine. Improved prediction capabilities and low false positive rates on healthy data are realized.","","article","","29","","","An optimized back propagation neural network for automated evaluation of health condition using sensor data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665917423001824","2665-9174","2023","100846","Measurement: Sensors"

The increasing trend was most significant on the monthly, seasonal and annual timescales of the TMIN, followed by TMEAN. In contrast, the mixed trends in TMAX were not significant. The global rate of change trends of TMIN, TMAX and TMEAN are 0.091, −0.007 and 0.043 °C/decade respectively. The overall warming of TMEAN also had a significant upward shift change of 0.43 °C since 1980 and the change spatially is characterized by a SW-NE orientation. There is a need to embrace green settlement and a green economy to reduce the impact of the ever-increasing warming trend over the region.","","article","","131","","","Analysis of variations and trends of temperature over Niger central hydrological area, Nigeria, 1911–2015","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147470652300089X","1474-7065","2023","103445","Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C"

There has been a large body of work in the literature on knowledge transfer and reuse. However, when the number of tasks increases to a certain extent, the potential negative knowledge transfer between tasks becomes a great challenge for most multitask evolutionary algorithms. To allay this threat, this study proposes an adaptive knowledge transfer strategy for evolutionary many-task optimization via density-based clustering (AEMaTO-DC). AEMaTO-DC contains an adaptive mating selection mechanism, a correlation task evaluation and selection mechanism and a cluster-based knowledge interaction mechanism between tasks. Specifically, AEMaTO-DC regulates the probability of knowledge transfer by comparing the relative intensity of the intertask evolution rate and intratask evolution rate. In knowledge transfer, AEMaTO-DC selects related tasks by a maximum mean discrepancy metric, and it determines the intensity of intertask interaction by a density-based clustering method. We compare the performance of AEMaTO-DC with several state-of-the-art multitask evolutionary algorithms on a variety of synthetic benchmarks and a real-world multitask optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate that AEMaTO-DC shows competitive success rates in solving the many-task problems used, and it takes advantage of synergistic relationships among solution processes for the tasks addressed.","","article","","278","","","Many-task evolutionary algorithm with adaptive knowledge transfer via density-based clustering","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705123006561","0950-7051","2023","110906","Knowledge-Based Systems"

Assessment of cold chain safety risks can therefore reduce chance of accidents and concern for product damage. The goal of this study was to use the best worst method (BWM) to assess key risk factors in container carriers' cold chain logistics operations. After gathering relevant information from the literature and conducting expert interviews, this study preliminarily determined risk factors affecting container carriers' cold chain logistics operations, and obtained 15 risk factors in 3 risk assessment aspects. A BWM model was then developed and tested using empirical data from a questionnaire survey of experts. The results indicated that (1) the “shipper risk” aspect is the most important risk link for container carriers' cold chain logistics; (2) the 6 key risk factors with the greatest effect on container carriers' cold chain logistics are “excessively long container loading time,” “insufficient pre-cooling of goods,” “poor or improper product packaging,” “dockside or shipboard power supply system malfunction,” “improper cargo stacking,” and “human error affecting temperature settings.” As a reference for container carriers engaging in cold chain logistics, this study also suggests risk management strategies intended to enhance cold chain safety and performance.","","article","","153","","","Assessment of key risk factors in the cold chain logistics operations of container carriers using best worst method","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140700723001810","0140-7007","2023","116-126","International Journal of Refrigeration"

Clustering using the data stored in The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a current research hotspot. However, there are three problems in the past clustering analysis. First, the traditional Douglas-Peucker (DP) Compression Algorithm exists feature point loss and trajectory distortion when compressing trajectories. Second, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm require high time cost. Finally, most of the studies ignore the interaction between parameters when choosing the parameters of DBSCAN. These problems seriously affect the efficiency and accuracy of clustering. To solve these problems, this paper improves the existing methods by (1) Adaptive selection of compression thresholds and trajectory feature points for each trajectory when using the DP algorithm ensures the realism of the compressed trajectory; (2) using the Fast-DTW algorithm to improve the computation speed and ensure the accuracy of trajectory similarity; (3) Self-selection of parameter combinations based on Silhouette Coefficient (SC) scores was achieved using the similarity distribution of the trajectories in combination with an improved K-Adaptive Nearest Neighbors (KANN).

This is particularly relevant for the Ría the Vigo and its adjacent shelf, a highly productive ecosystem at the northern limit of the Canary Current Upwelling System (CanCUS). This study analyses a 34-year time series (1987–2020) of Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, the longest series available to date in the region. Long-term trends, shifts, and seasonal variability of temperature and salinity were assessed and investigated in relation to regional meteorological variability and basin-scale atmospheric teleconnection indices. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) allowed us to determine that monthly thermohaline variability can be largely explained by regional meteo-climatic variability, mainly upwelling index and river discharge. Trends and shifts in some teleconnection patterns, especially the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, may also be related to both the shift in salinity in 2013 and its long-term decrease below 50 m depth. Despite the current global warming context, no statistically significant trend was observed for either the upwelling index or temperature. The spatial analysis of sea surface temperature trends suggests that our study area has been responding to climate change differently from other surrounding near-shore areas, as the Finisterre Cape or the southern Bay of Biscay. Overall, this study highlights the importance of long-term observations to elucidate the impact of climate change in the northern limit of the CanCUS and encourages caution when extrapolating conclusions from ecosystem studies on a regional scale.","","article","","901","","","Temperature and salinity trends in the northern limit of the Canary Current Upwelling System","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723044145","0048-9697","2023","165791","Science of The Total Environment"

Yet, these complex environments are threatened by sea level rise and possibly enhanced storminess in the future. Most of the studies on coastal dune erosion and recovery from storms are either site specific or focus on a short-time scale, from months to a couple of years. Here, airborne LiDAR data collected from 2011 to 2020 at eight diverse coastal dunes, spread from NW England to SW France, were analysed to study their response, and recovery from the most energetic extreme storms wave conditions since at least 1948. Results show that the 2013/14 winter was the first or second largest erosive event (from −14 to −290 m3/m dune volume loss) from 2011 to 2020 at all sites. The magnitude of storm-driven sand volume loss was mainly controlled by dune face slope (r = 0.84). Dunes with steeper pre-storm slopes lost the largest volumes of sand. At a dune scale, the scarping height was also well correlated to the dune face slope at sites where storm response was characterized by limited alongshore variability. Dune recovery was site specific (no recovery, partial, complete, excess), with dunes that either progressively returned to their pre-storm morphology or were reshaped while recovering. Percentage of dune sand volume recovery was well correlated to the local and long-term satellite-derived shoreline change rate computed from 1984 to 2021 (r = 0.81), suggesting that dune recovery is mainly controlled by the local coastal sediment budget. The rate of dune crest elevation increase (from 4.2 to 12 cm/year) at four of the study sites from 2011 to 2020, largely exceeded sea level rise rate over the past decade (3.3 ± 0.7 mm/year). These results provide key insight into the contrasting resilience of some of the most exposed coastal dunes along the Atlantic coast that recover at different rates following the same sequence of extreme storms.","","article","","435","","","Storm response and multi-annual recovery of eight coastal dunes spread along the Atlantic coast of Europe","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X23001551","0169-555X","2023","108735","Geomorphology"

Identifying similarities between different subsea pipeline failure events is crucial to improving the design, risk management practices, and regulation requirements, besides promoting accident prevention. This paper proposes applying the life cycle and management practices combined to analyze subsea pipeline incidents from the RDI (Detailed Incident Report) and investigations reported to ANP (Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Gas, and Biofuels), the Brazilian safety regulatory agency. Furthermore, subsea pipeline incidents data were analyzed: correlated circumstances, consequences, and causes. The results show that most riser and flowlines causal factors are related to equipment failures, and recurrent root causes are design errors and integrity control. Based on the proposed approach, it was possible to identify gaps in most riser and flowlines accident investigations since there are few causal factors, root causes, and the absence of riser and flowlines failure mode and mechanisms. Therefore, the development of accident recommendations can be compromised. Thus, this paper proposes improvements to current Brazilian regulations to clarify the minimal subsea pipeline accident investigation requirements.","","article","","83","","","Subsea pipelines incidents prevention: A case study in Brazil","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950423023000372","0950-4230","2023","105007","Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries"

Single beam echosounders (SBES) are a good technology for detecting CO2 leakage in the water column for application in a marine Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MM&V) framework. Characterisation of active acoustic data is needed to determine whether levels of water column backscatter enable CO2 gas leaks to be detected, and to understand acoustic false positives caused by naturally occurring acoustic signals (e.g., fish schools). We used acoustic data collected by SBES fitted to two mobile and two fixed sensor platforms over four years to characterise the site of the proposed CarbonNet CCS Project subsurface CO2 storage reservoir. We observed diel and seasonal variability in water column backscatter and fish school abundance. Water column backscatter was highest at night and in Austral summer and autumn periods but was at a level that would allow small CO2 gas leaks to be detected. Fish abundance was highest during the day and in Austral summer and autumn. To reduce the likelihood of acoustic false positives, surveys designed to detect CO2 gas leaks using active acoustic technologies could prioritise data collection at night and during the months where fish school abundance is lowest. Understanding these sources of natural variability can guide survey strategies and response actions.","","article","","126","","","Variability in acoustic backscatter and fish school abundance at a shallow water CCS site","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583623000828","1750-5836","2023","103912","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

Understanding its climatology and changing characteristics is important for comprehending climate change, enhancing atmospheric model, and obtaining accurate hydrologic responses. However, due to the various limitations of precipitation observations, the internal intensity distributions of global precipitation systems have not been thoroughly investigated. This study uses the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) data during 2001–2020 to investigate the internal intensity distributions of global precipitation systems, by analyzing the climatology and changes in the radial intensity distributions and the core-region intensity of precipitation systems.

The set of CLASS4 reference data has been recently extended to include near-surface currents derived from the trajectories of drifting buoys drogued at 15 m. We have applied these data to the Ocean Model, Analysis and Prediction System (OceanMAPS) at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABoM) for verification and inter-comparison with Mercator Océan International ocean forecast system (MOi), the operational models of the Met Office, UK: Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) and Coupled Atmosphere-Land-Ocean-Ice Data Assimilation (CPLDA) systems, and the Global Ice Ocean Prediction System (GDPS-GIOPS) at the Canadian Centre for Meteorological and Environmental Prediction (CCMEP). The aims for this verification analysis are to extend the routine monitoring of the operational system; to assess the OceanMAPS skill against other models; and to inform our stakeholders of the OceanMAPS performance. We have evaluated the impacts of adding Stokes drift and tidal currents from separate global wave and global tide models to the model currents on the verification of currents. Including Stokes drift leads to significant improvements in representation and the metrics for model skill while inclusion of tides has no significant impact on the global statistics. Zonal currents have a stronger signal than the meridional currents as indicated by their high correlation with observations, and lower errors. This indicates zonal currents on average are more predictable and persistent than the meridional currents, resulting in improved representation in the models. Overall, MOi, and the new version of OceanMAPS (4.0i), and FOAM show marginally better performance against the observations relative to other models. Although there are significant differences in the configurations of the eight models under evaluation, all the models are shown to be remarkably statistically equivalent with consistent spatial and temporal patterns indicating the main differences are attributable to unrepresented processes. We therefore conclude that there is significant scope to further improve the representation of the modelled currents with the observations.","","article","","186","","","Verification and intercomparison of global ocean Eulerian near-surface currents","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500323000823","1463-5003","2023","102241","Ocean Modelling"

The analysis and prediction results demonstrated that the MJO improved the predictive skill of the extended-range PM2.5 forecast. The MJO indexes, namely, real-time multivariate MJO series 1 (RMM1) and real-time multivariate MJO series 2 (RMM2), ranked the first, and seventh, respectively, in terms of the predictive contribution of all meteorological predictors. When the MJO was not introduced, the correlation coefficients for the forecasts on lead times of 11–40 days ranged from 0.27 to 0.55, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranged from 23.4 to 31.8 μg/m3. After the MJO was introduced, the correlation coefficients for the 11–40 day forecast ranged from 0.31 to 0.56, among which those for the 16–40 day forecast substantially improved, and the RMSEs ranged from 23.2 to 28.7 μg/m3. When comparing the prediction scores, such as percent correct (PC), critical success index (CSI), and equitable threat score (ETS), the forecast model was more accurate when it introduced the MJO. A novel aspect of this study is to investigate the effects of the MJO mechanism on the meteorological conditions of air pollution in eastern China through advanced regression analysis. The MJO indexes RMM1 and RMM2 considerably impacted the geopotential height field of 28°–40° at 300–250 hPa 45 days in advance. When RMM1 increased and RMM2 decreased 45 days in advance, the 500 hPa geopotential height field weakened accordingly, and the bottom of the 500 hPa trough moved southward; thus cold air was more easily transported southward and the upstream air pollutants were transported to eastern China. With a weak ground pressure field and dry air at low altitudes, the westerly wind component increased, which led to the easier formation of a weather configuration favorable for the accumulation and transport of air pollution, thus resulting in an increase in PM2.5 concentration in the region. These findings can guide forecasters regarding the utility of MJO and S2S for subseasonal air pollution outlooks.","","article","","880","","","PM2.5 extended-range forecast based on MJO and S2S using LightGBM","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723019770","0048-9697","2023","163358","Science of The Total Environment"

The evaluation includes monthly precipitation estimates, spatial detection of precipitation, and drought monitoring against a regional gridded dataset spanning 2007–2019. A study area covering Poland and parts of the neighboring countries in Central Europe was selected for this evaluation. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at multi-time scales was employed to monitor meteorological (SPI-3), agricultural (SPI-6, SPI-9), and hydrological (SPI-12) droughts over the study region. This study selected PERSIANNCDR as a top-down precipitation dataset and SM2RAIN-ASCAT as a bottom-up dataset. According to the results, both datasets exhibit good accuracy for precipitation estimations, but PERSIANNCDR shows higher accuracy based on the R (coefficient of correlation) and KGE (Kling-Gupta Efficiency) performance indicators. However, SM2RAIN-ASCAT has a lower bias according to PBIAS(%) (percent bias). The reference dataset indicates that the study area experienced dry conditions over 50% of the months. Specifically, based on the reference dataset, 12 (SPI-6) and 16 (SPI-9) severe agricultural droughts were detected. Twenty-four severe agricultural drought events were identified via SPI-6, while the longer SPI window (SPI-9) demonstrated that PERSIANNCDR assessed 20 severe droughts over the study area. SM2RAIN-ASCAT detected 11 severe agricultural droughts via SPI-6 and SPI-9. Furthermore, based on SPI-12, the reference dataset identified 75 hydrological droughts, while the top-down dataset indicated a lower number of hydrological droughts (67 events) than the reference dataset over the studied period. In contrast, the bottom-up dataset detected 84 hydrological droughts. The spatial distribution of severe meteorological droughts showed a clear pattern with predominant occurrence in eastern parts (Vistula River Basin), as shown by the reference dataset, while this pattern changed for agricultural and hydrological droughts (Odra River Basin). Additionally, the results reveal that meteorological drought does not have a similar spatial distribution to agricultural and hydrological droughts.","","article","","342","","","Detecting drought events over a region in Central Europe using a regional and two satellite-based precipitation datasets","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192323004239","0168-1923","2023","109733","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

Traditional product redesign can identify functional requirements from customer needs by functional analysis and utilize inventive principles of TRIZ to address the problems. However, the relationships between the customer needs (CNs), engineering parameters (EPs), and inventive principles (IPs) has not been explored, which may limit and hinder the opportunity for product innovation. To improve the design efficiency, Random Forest (RF) is introduced in this method to mine the relationship between EPs and IPs by researching many cases for design knowledge. A systematic redesign process is proposed to apply the design knowledge. Firstly, functional analysis is used to decompose customer needs (CNs) into product functions. And then, the effect-based approach which is the application of scientific laws is used to transform functions into EPs. Secondly, IPs are recommended based on EPs by a trained RF model. Finally, the specific solution is generated from the problem domain using the analogy design based on the Su-Field model.

Air pollution can result from natural causes, including volcanic eruptions and extreme droughts, or human activities, including motor vehicle emissions, industry, and the burning of farmland and forests. Emission sources emit multiple pollutant types with diverse characteristics and impacts. However, there has been little research on the risk of multiple air pollutants; thus, it is difficult to identify multi-pollutant mitigation processes, particularly in Southeast Asia, where air pollution moves dynamically across national borders. In this study, the main objective was to develop a multi-air pollution risk index product for CO, NO2, and SO2 based on Sentinel-5P remote sensing data from 2019 to 2020. The risk index was developed by integrating hazard, vulnerability, and exposure analyses. Hazard analysis considers air pollution data from remote sensing, vulnerability analysis considers the air pollution sources, and exposure analysis considers the population density. The novelty of this study lies in its development of a multi-risk model that considers the weights obtained from the relationship between the hazard and vulnerability parameters. The highest air pollution risk index values were observed in urban areas, with a high exposure index that originates from pollution caused by human activity. Multi-risk analysis of the three air pollutants revealed that Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines had the largest percentages of high-risk areas, while Indonesia had the largest total high-risk area (4361 km2). Using the findings of this study, the patterns and characteristics of the risk distribution of multiple air pollutants in Southeast Asia can be identified, which can be used to mitigate multi-pollutant sources, particularly with respect to supporting the clean air targets in the Sustainable Development Goals.","","article","","854","","","Multi-air pollution risk assessment in Southeast Asia region using integrated remote sensing and socio-economic data products","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722059241","0048-9697","2023","158825","Science of The Total Environment"

This study is the first to evaluate the changes in heavy metal concentrations worldwide in brown algae over the last 90 years (>15,700 data across the globe reported from 1933 to 2020). The study findings revealed significant decreases in the concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb and Zn of around 60–84% (ca. 2% annual) in brown algae tissues. The decreases were consistent across the different families considered (Dictyotaceae, Fucaceae, Laminariaceae, Sargassaceae and Others), and began between 1970 and 1990. In addition, strong relationships between these trends and pH, SST and heat content were detected. Although the observed metal declines could be partially explained by these strong correlations, or by adaptions in the algae, other evidences suggest an actual reduction in metal concentrations in oceans because of the implementation of environmental policies. In any case, this study shows a reduction in metal concentrations in brown algae over the last 50 years, which is important in itself, as brown algae form the basis of many marine food webs and are therefore potential distributors of pollutants.","","article","","445","","","Global decrease in heavy metal concentrations in brown algae in the last 90 years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389422023056","0304-3894","2023","130511","Journal of Hazardous Materials"

Although Iran's southwest precipitation data were used to extract these dates, we showed that the SWPP or SWWD is associated with large-scale climate variability. After proving that the MJO indices are insufficient to explain differences between SWPP and SWWD, we introduced several non-MJO indexes to explain these differences. Among the proposed indicators, two quasi-oscillations of the sea surface temperature and air pressure systems were more significant. These oscillations operate between the west and east of the Arabian Sea and between the Arabian sea and Mediterranean Sea.The study explained why compared to La Niña, El Niño enhances (suppresses) precipitation in western and northern (eastern and southern) Iran and the Arabian Peninsula.

Conversely, the climate systems over the tropical East Atlantic Ocean and West Africa are generally opposite between –IOD and + IOD. We justified how the interaction between climate systems in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans shortens (elongates) phase 8's lifetime during +IOD (-IOD).

The ever-increasing intensity of operations at CTs in recent years has also resulted in increasing environmental concerns, and they are experiencing an unprecedented pressure to lower their emissions. Operational Research (OR), as a key player in the optimisation of the complex decision problems that arise from the quay and land side operations at CTs, has been therefore presented with new challenges and opportunities to incorporate environmental considerations into decision making and better utilise the ‘big data’ that is continuously generated from the never-stopping operations at CTs. The state-of-the-art literature on OR's incorporation of environmental considerations and its interplay with Big Data Analytics (BDA) is, however, still very much underdeveloped, fragmented, and divergent, and a guiding framework is completely missing. This paper presents a review of the most relevant developments in the field and sheds light on promising research opportunities for the better exploitation of the synergistic effect of the two disciplines in addressing CT operational problems, while incorporating uncertainty and environmental concerns efficiently. The paper finds that while OR has thus far contributed to improving the environmental performance of CTs (rather implicitly), this can be much further stepped up with more explicit incorporation of environmental considerations and better exploitation of BDA predictive modelling capabilities. New interdisciplinary research at the intersection of conventional CT optimisation problems, energy management and sizing, and net-zero technology and energy vectors adoption is also presented as a prominent line of future research.","","article","","310","","","The synergistic effect of operational research and big data analytics in greening container terminal operations: A review and future directions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221722009274","0377-2217","2023","943-973","European Journal of Operational Research"

Terrestrial ecosystem dynamics in ice free areas are strongly influenced by permafrost and the associated active layer. These features are the least studied component of the cryosphere in Antarctica, with sparse data from permanent study sites mainly providing information related to the ground thermal regime and active layer thickness (ALT). One of the most important results of the International Polar Year (IPY, 2007/08) was an increase in ground thermal regime monitoring sites, and consequently our knowledge of Antarctic permafrost dynamics. Now, 15 years after the IPY, we provide the first comprehensive summary of the state of permafrost across Antarctica, including the sub-Antarctic Islands, with analyses of spatial and temporal patterns of the dominant external factors (climate, lithology, biota, and hydric regime) on the ground thermal regime and active layer thickness. The mean annual ground temperatures of the active layer and uppermost part of the permafrost in Antarctica remain just below 0 °C in the warmest parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, and were below −20 °C in mountainous regions of the continent. The ALT varies between a few cm in the coldest, mountainous, parts of the Transantarctic Mountains up to >5 m in bedrock sites in the Antarctic Peninsula. The deepest and most variable ALTs (ca. 40 to >500 cm) were found in the Antarctic Peninsula, whereas the maximum ALT generally did not exceed 90 cm in Victoria Land and East Antarctica. Notably, found that the mean annual near-surface temperature follows the latitudinal gradient of −0.9 °C/deg. (R2 = 0.9) and the active layer thickness 3.7 cm/deg. (R2 = 0.64). The continuous permafrost occurs in the vast majority of the ice-free areas in Antarctica. The modelling of temperature on the top of the permafrost indicates also the permafrost presence in South Orkneys and South Georgia.

Integrating Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) with shipborne Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides a viable solution. However, the system's reliability heavily relies on GNSS availability. This paper proposes a method to enhance the reliability of shipborne INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems during GNSS abnormal sampling periods. The proposed method consists of two parts. Firstly, using specially designed input and output parameters, a pseudo-GNSS prediction model based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-LSTM) is constructed to generate predicted pseudo-GNSS measurements during periods of GNSS loss, effectively filling in the gaps left by the absence of actual GNSS data. Secondly, Huber's M-estimation-based Robust Cubature Kalman filter (RCKF) is integrated into the data fusion algorithm, and a switching mechanism between RCKF and the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is established based on the source of GNSS data utilized for measurement update, to mitigate the impact of non-Gaussian distribution prediction noise introduced by pseudo-GNSS prediction model.

We included studies published by Central Asian researchers in Russian language, which are usually not easily accessible to international researchers. Most studies agreed on general warming trends in Central Asia with acceleration since the 1970s, but varied with regard to seasonal changes and the magnitude of the warming. Most studies also confirmed that glaciers in the Tien Shan and the Pamir continue to retreat and to shrink, though only little is known about mass and volume changes. Only few studies investigated changes in seasonal snow cover, and they suggested a decrease in maximum snow depth and a reduction in snow cover duration. The studies on runoff trends in the high mountain areas of Central Asia indicated a complex response of catchments to changes in climate. It appears that catchments with a higher fraction of glacierized area showed mainly increasing runoff trends in the past, while river basins with less or no glacierization exhibited large variations in the observed runoff changes. We conclude that our knowledge is still incomplete in particular with regard to the magnitude and the spatio-temporal patterns of changes in the water cycle of Central Asian headwater catchments. The limitations in our knowledge are due to (1) the scarcity of reliable and appropriate data sets especially for the glacio-nival zone; (2) methodological limitations of trend analysis; (3) the heterogeneity in both spatial and temporal extent of the available analyses, hampering the synthesis to a regional picture; and (4) the insufficiently understood interactions between changes in highly-variable climate parameters, the cryosphere, and the hydrological response of individual headwater catchments. Finally, there is a need for sound attribution studies linking the observed hydrological changes in individual catchments to particular processes triggered by climatic and cryospheric changes. This research gap needs urgently to be closed as projections of future hydrological changes are of vital importance for water management in Central Asia.","","article","","110","","","What do we know about past changes in the water cycle of Central Asian headwaters?

Based on detailed oxygen isotope analyses and biotic census counts in 52 cores across the world ocean, last interglacial sea-surface temperatures (SST) were compared with those today. There are small SST departures in the mid-latitude North Atlantic (warmer) and the Gulf of Mexico (cooler). The eastern boundary currents of the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans are marked by large SST anomalies in individual cores, but their interpretations are precluded by no-analog problems and by discordancies among estimates from different biotic groups. In general, the last interglacial ocean was not significantly different from the modern ocean. The relative sequencing of ice decay versus oceanic warming on the Stage 6/5 oxygen isotopic transition and of ice growth versus oceanic cooling on the Stage 5e/5d transition was also studied. In most of the Southern Hemisphere, the oceanic response marked by the biotic census counts preceded (led) the global ice-volume response marked by the oxygen-isotope signal by several thousand years. The reverse pattern is evident in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, where the oceanic response lagged that of global ice volume by several thousand years. As a result, the very warm temperatures associated with the last interglaciation were regionally diachronous by several thousand years. These regional lead-lag relationships agree with those observed on other transitions and in long-term phase relationships; they cannot be explained simply as artifacts of bioturbational translations of the original signals.","","article","","21","","","The last interglacial ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003358948490098X","0033-5894","1984","123-224","Quaternary Research"

The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.","","article","","19","","","The future of the technology-based manufacturing in the European Union","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590123023004838","2590-1230","2023","101356","Results in Engineering"

Firstly, the aim of this study was to perceive the daily, monthly and seasonal variation patterns of ozone concentrations. Diurnal cycles are presented by season and the fit of the data to a normal distribution is tested. In order to assess ozone behaviour under temperate weather conditions, local meteorological variables (wind direction and speed, temperature, relative humidity, pressure and rainfall) were monitored together with ozone concentrations. The main relationships we could observe in these analyses were then used to obtain a regression equation linking diurnal ozone concentrations in summer with meteorological parameters.","","article","","299","","","Assessment of ozone variations and meteorological effects in an urban area in the Mediterranean Coast","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969702002516","0048-9697","2002","97-113","Science of The Total Environment"

In the Porcupine Basin they occur in water depths of 650–1000 m, whereas in the Vulcan Sub-basin they occur in water depths of 200–350 m. Shallow seabed coring in the Porcupine Basin has provided data on the age, lithological composition and hydrocarbon concentrations in the upper 3 m layer of sediment both on and off the mounds. In both basins the mounds occur close to faults which may provide conduits for upward migrating hydrocarbons. The seepage of hydrocarbons is suspected to have caused local eutrophication or ‘fertilization’ by providing nutrients to bacteria, which in turn are part of the food chain for higher organisms.

Their synergistic use could greatly benefit the broad user community by ensuring a global view of the Earth with high-quality products. A necessary condition for data fusion is radiometric calibration agreement between the two instruments. Earlier studies showed about 3% absolute radiometric difference between MISR and respective MODIS land bands in the visible and near-IR spectrum, which are also used in aerosol and cloud research. This study compared two surface albedo products derived from MODIS and MISR L1B data using the AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN). The ASRVN shows a positive MISR–MODIS albedo bias of +(0.01–0.03). Cross-sensor calibration inconsistencies were identified as a primary cause of the albedo biases. To establish an independent MODIS–MISR calibration link, top-of-atmosphere MODIS and MISR reflectances were regressed against each other over liquid water clouds. The empirical regression results have been adjusted for the differences in the respective MISR and MODIS spectral responses using radiative transfer simulations. The MISR–MODIS band gain differences for the top-of-atmosphere reflectance estimated with this technique are +6.0% in the Blue, +3.3% in the Green, +2.7% in the Red, and +0.8% in the NIR band. Applying the derived values to rescale the MODIS or MISR L1B data is shown to significantly reduce the cross-sensor ASRVN surface albedo biases. An absolute calibration scale for both sensors could be established based on independent ground-based measurements of the surface albedo at selected AERONET sites.","","article","","107","","","Analysis of MODIS–MISR calibration differences using surface albedo around AERONET sites and cloud reflectance","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425706004299","0034-4257","2007","12-21","Remote Sensing of Environment"

The foredune ridges consist of very well to well sorted fine- to medium-grained aeolian sand and are underlain by seaward dipping foreshore sediments. The studied sequence of 38 ridges was formed between 6.91±0.58ka and 2.54±0.19ka ago, and represents a period of falling relative sea level. Foredune plain progradation, with average rates of 0.3–0.6m per year, was controlled by isostatic land uplift, which caused a continuous withdrawal of shorelines to lower elevations. The dated foredune succession was used to reconstruct the coastal palaeogeography of the island. Palaeogeographical reconstructions show that during two phases of Late Mesolithic habitation, at ca. 7.2cal.ka BP and 6.2cal.ka BP, seal hunters settled the coastal zone of Ruhnu Island. Based on tool material and pottery type they could have originated from Saaremaa Island, which according to palaeoreconstruction of the Gulf of Riga, was located approximately 70km northwest of Ruhnu Island during the Late Mesolithic. Later signs of human occupation, radiocarbon dated to ca. 4.7cal.ka BP, were from the centre of the island, hundreds of metres away from the shore at about 8m above its contemporary sea level. This Late Neolithic habitation shows a clearly different pattern than earlier coastal settlement, and suggests a shift in subsistence strategy towards agriculture and animal husbandry.","","article","","303","","","Reconstructing Holocene shore displacement and Stone Age palaeogeography from a foredune sequence on Ruhnu Island, Gulf of Riga, Baltic Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X17305251","0169-555X","2018","434-445","Geomorphology"

The average thickness of the sedimentary cover which may contain favourable petroleum reservoirs overlying the basement of the Northern Appalachians of Quebec was determined by this method. Additional information related to structural geology of the basement and the sedimentary cover can also be obtained with this technique. The center of the Temiscouata area is located at longitude 69° W and latitude 47° 45′ N and the one of the Gulf at 67° 45′ W and 49° 05′ N. The aeromagnetic data were digitized from the 1 mile = 1 inch total field contour maps published by EMR. In the digitization process, the magnetic intensities were read on contour lines only. Interpolation at fixed intervals were calculated with the help of a computer program subroutine. The fixed intervals were chosen at 0.25, 0.50 on shore and 1.00 mile offshore in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The magnetic gradient was removed using the IGRF formula or numerical filters. The least square method was avoided because of the biasing it involves. Additional smoothing was occasionally done. After these different steps were executed, the transformation to obtain the Fourier co-efficients was carried out using an algorithm for computing the Mixed Radix Fast Fourier Transform. Mean depths are then calculated from the energy spectra; this constitutes a statistical approach. The mean depths obtained from the 1-D energy spectrum are comparable within 10–15% with the ones obtained from the 2-D energy spectrum. 1-D spectral analysis of AM data offers some advantages on the 2-D counterpart. Among these, we can mention the eventuality of obtaining mean depths to the basement from the analysis of only a few AM flight lines in a new area and of detailing more accurately structural features of local nature in the basement. Such structural features may be controlling agents in eventual reservoirs within the sedimentary rocks.","","article","","17","","","One-dimensional spectral analysis of aeromagnetic data from Temiscouata area and the western sector of the Gulf of St. Lawrence","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001671427990022X","0016-7142","1979","269-283","Geoexploration"

The approaches are evaluated for both quality and quantity of their retrieved Rrs in the visible domain. The quality is gauged through three statistical measures between in situ and MODIS-retrieved Rrs: root mean square error (RMSE, sr−1), unbiased root mean square (uRMS), and mean bias (δ, sr−1). For common points where both approaches yield valid Rrs retrievals, POLYMER shows worse performance than NSAC for blue bands (<488 nm) and comparable performance for green and red bands. However, POLYMER shows the ability to retrieve more valid Rrs data points (2–3 folds) than NSAC for this evaluation dataset primarily because the latter fails over strong sun glint regions where the MODIS NIR bands saturate but the former is designed to work over sun glint regions using non-saturation MODIS bands. For those data points where only POLYMER yield valid Rrs retrievals, data quality is slightly worse than from the common data points. Although these results may vary slightly among individual subregions, it is generally true that POLYMER may be used as a surrogate of NSAC for atmospheric correction of MODIS when data quantity is significantly limited due to perturbations of sun glint and thin clouds that are typical for subtropical and tropical regions.","","article","","216","","","Comparison of two atmospheric correction approaches applied to MODIS measurements over North American waters","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718303390","0034-4257","2018","442-455","Remote Sensing of Environment"

However, the effectiveness of the implemented strategies is influenced by the extent to which asset failure dependencies are taken into account during the risk assessment process. In the literature, several risk assessment methods are discussed that vary widely depending on factors such as modelling of failure dependencies in dynamic assets, and treating uncertainties associated with sparse reliability data. These factors invariably influence the extent to which different risk assessment methods are applicable for maintenance decision making. This article reviews the state-of-the-art knowledge on risk assessment in the context of maintenance decision making, with a particular focus on dependability modelling methods. The review structures knowledge on dependability modelling approaches, treatment of uncertainty, and highlights important challenges researchers and practitioners are likely to experience when performing risk assessment in the context of maintenance decision making.

These requirements become more stringent if the mission is designed to be accomplished using a small spacecraft. The navigation subsystem is without any doubts essential and nowadays, several systems offer different solutions to the navigation problem. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) such as GPS, GLONASS, or the future Galileo and BeiDou systems, introduce an easier way to provide an autonomous on-board orbit determination system; they only require an on-board GNSS receiver, with low-cost, low-power consumption and limited mass and volume. While GNSS receivers have been already exploited with success for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), their use for very High Earth Orbit (HEO) up to the Moon altitude is still at the research stage. In this context, the purpose of the present work is to determine the potential achievable accuracy of a code-based GNSS receiver solution, during the whole trajectory to reach the Moon. GPS, Galileo, and GPS-Galileo combined (dual constellation) solutions are estimated, by considering constellations availability, pseudorange error factors and geometry factors. Unlike previous investigations, our study is making use of the very accurate multi-GNSS constellation simulator “Spirent GSS8000”, which supports simultaneously the GPS and Galileo systems with L1, L5, E1, and E5 frequency bands. The contribution of this study, clearly demonstrates that GNSS signals can be tracked up to the Moon׳s surface, but not with the current GNSS receiver׳s technology for terrestrial use. We consider and discuss a possible navigation solution that uses a double constellation GPS-Galileo receiver aided by an on board orbital filter system in order to improve the accuracy of the navigation solution and achieve the required sensitivity.","","article","","116","","","Feasibility study of GNSS as navigation system to reach the Moon","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576515002520","0094-5765","2015","186-201","Acta Astronautica"

Iron monosulphides (FeSx) are most often found as a minor constituent of the reduced sulphur pool in these sediments and are believed to be precursor phases which convert to pyrite during early diagenesis. Abnormally high ratios of acid-volatile sulphides (AVS) to pyrite, however, are found in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord, Canada. The AVS-S:FeS2S ratio observed throughout the anoxic zone in three sediment cores collected along the main axis of the fjord generally exceeds 1 and reaches values as high as 7 at the head of the fjord. To document and explain this anomaly, solid phase components (AVS, FeS2, S0, reactive iron (FeHCl), CORG, and total N) as well as porewater constituents (SO4, Fe, and Mn) were analyzed. Degree of pyritization (DOP) values were low (0.1–11%) and generally decreased toward the mouth of the fjord. In contrast, degree of sulphidization (DOS) estimates were high and reached values of up to 43% at the head of the fjord. These latter values indicate that pyrite formation is not limited by iron availability but a large excess of reactive iron may in fact inhibit the build-up of reduced sulphur (ΣH2S) in the porewaters as a result of AVS-S precipitation. In the absence of a strong ΣH2S gradient, slow diffusion to the redox boundary and limited formation of soluble intermediate reduced sulphur species may hinder the conversion of AVS to pyrite.","","article","","59","","","Anomalous accumulation of acid-volatile sulphides (AVS) in a coastal marine sediment, Saguenay Fjord, Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001670379500163T","0016-7037","1995","2663-2675","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

They are characterized by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against desmogleins (Dsg). In this prospective study, we treated 21 pemphigus patients with rituximab and analyzed immunological modifications induced by anti-CD20 immunotherapy. The total depletion of peripheral B cells led to a significant decrease of total serum IgM but not IgG levels. The B-cell depletion was followed by a progressive re-emergence of naive blood B lymphocytes, with one-third of them expressing a transitional CD19+CD38highCD24high phenotype. In most patients, clinical response to rituximab was closely related to the evolution of anti-Dsg autoantibodies that decreased in patients who achieved complete remission, whereas they remained unchanged or reincreased in relapsing patients. In contrast, serum antimicrobial IgG remained stable after rituximab treatment. B-cell repertoire analysis of three patients using immunoscope showed distortions of VH-IgM and VH-IgG immunoscope profiles before treatment, particularly clonal and oligoclonal expansions in some VH families, which were not found after B-cell reconstitution, following anti-CD20 immunotherapy. The depletion of autoreactive B cells leading to the elimination of anti-Dsg autoantibodies in most remitted patients and the restoration of a diverse B-cell repertoire by naive B lymphocytes may provide an explanation for the long-lasting efficacy of rituximab in pemphigus patients.

These residues were composed of remnants of silicate minerals, calcite, metal sulfides and metals that often appeared as complex poly-mineralic melts within melt pits. A further survey of 10–100μm diameter craters identified that the most common chemistry was space debris with the crossover from meteoroids to debris being at around 30μm DCO. Residues include remnants of specialised steels and paint fragments but the dominant type is aluminium and aluminium oxide, which are almost certainly remnants of solid rocket motor operations.

Here, we document shifts in calcite growth mechanisms, from ion-by-ion to nanoparticle/nanocrystal attachment, in stalagmites from the tropical island of Atiu (South Pacific). Changes in solution stoichiometry and organic matter content result in the development of two columnar fabrics that are common elsewhere in settings characterized by seasonal contrast. A porous columnar fabric, characterized by intracrystalline micro and nanoporosity grows via a non-classical pathway through amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles (∼2–4 nm in diameter) and calcite nanocrystal attachment. Despite subsequent transformation of nanoparticles/crystals into a large calcite crystal, the porous columnar fabric appears to preserve a δ18O signal that faithfully reflects that of the parent fluid via quasi-equilibrium fractionation. Furthermore, the porous fabric shows random and fuzzy lateral distributions of Sr, another hydrological proxy, yet this element's incorporation follows equilibrium partitioning. The chemical properties of compact columnar fabrics, which appear to grow by classical ion-by-ion attachment, may not directly reflect those of the original depositional environment because of degassing, the presence of growth inhibitors (such as Na) and very early diagenetic modifications. Columnar porous calcite fabrics that formed through non-classical pathways in other settings may faithfully record the original properties of the parent drip water, whereas compact fabrics that formed through classical pathways elsewhere may not. It is concluded that the study of fabrics at the nano-scale is a necessary complement to speleothem research to identify the influence of crystallization pathways on the accuracy of proxy data.","","article","","297","","","Crystallization pathways, fabrics and the capture of climate proxies in speleothems: Examples from the tropics","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379122004644","0277-3791","2022","107833","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N2O5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding the low level of SO2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant emissions SW of Milan, beyond the Apennines. A distinctive pattern for HCl was observed, featured by an afternoon peak and a morning minimum, and best correlated to atmospheric temperature, although it was not possible to identify any specific source. The ratio of primary-dominated organic carbon and elemental carbon on hourly PM2.5 resulted 1.7. Black carbon was highly correlated to elemental carbon and the average mass absorption coefficient resulted MAC=13.8 ± 0.2 m2 g−1.

Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970–1980, 1981–1999 and 2000–2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05–2.31, 0.08–0.19ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000–2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term.","","article","","63","","","Organic contaminants in bats: Trends and new issues","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412013002249","0160-4120","2014","40-52","Environment International"

Long daily records are rare for agricultural sites, but it is usually possible to obtain climatic parameters to use as input for a s stochastic model. An additional advantage to simulated weather is that many likely sequences can be generated, whereas observation furnishes only a single realization. The objective of this study was to develop a model to simulate weather records, that places emphasis on realistic variability, sequences, extremes and cross-correlation, as well as mean conditions. The model was designated Simulated Meteorological Input for Agricultural Models (SIMIAM), and relies on selection of air mass as the first stochastic step. All required variables are then generated using air mass statistics. The day's wet or dry character is ascertained by first-order Markov chain and, if wet, precipitation amount simulated in a two-parameter gamma distribution. A weakly-stationary generating system, that incorporates matrices of cross and auto-correlation coefficients, is used to simulate all other variables, including winds. Amarillo, Texas records were used to demonstrate model feasibility. Significantly different air masses were shown to be identifiable by gradient level wind directions, and their sequence was adequately modeled with a first-order Markovian process. SIMIAM was tested for Amorillo, Oklahoma City, and New Orleans, using 15 years of record to compute input (1961–1975), and comparing simulations against an independent 15 years of observations (1976–1990). Results indicated that the study objectives were mostly satisfied for the two inland cities. As input was compiled from discontinuous, multiple, area sources, these tests were robust. They were also considered to demonstrate model applicability, not only to point locations, but to areas of the south central United States. Test results for New Orleans were less acceptable, and further study is clearly necessary to achieve model transportability to different climatic zones.","","article","","88","","","Simulated meteorological input for agricultural models","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819239700035X","0168-1923","1997","241-258","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

Adopting a geoarchaeological approach, the combination of sedimentological, palynological, and geophysical data enables the reconstruction of various stages in the landscape evolution of the Lower Sagone River over the last 4000years, together with the history of human occupation. The methods consist of a palaeoenvironmental study of 9 boreholes drilled in the modern deltaic plain, at a maximum distance of 500m from the present-day shoreline. The laboratory analyses included mollusk identification and measurements of the grain-size distribution (by wet sieving). A series of 21 radiocarbon dates on charcoal, plant remains, wood fragments, and marine mollusk samples formed the basis for a chronostratigraphy. In order to reconstruct the vegetation history of the catchment, with particular attention to anthropogenic activity, pollen analysis was conducted on clay samples from the deepest borehole, and they revealed a semi-open forest during the Bronze Age and Late Iron Age with extensive pastoral activity and limited cereal cultivation. Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT) of 3 profiles across the alluvial plain was conducted in order to reveal the geometry of the sedimentary bodies. The salient features are the presence of a freshwater lake during the Mid- to Late Bronze Age (from 1500 to 1100cal. BCE), its transformation into an open marine bay from ca. 1100 until 500cal. BCE, and the formation of a confined lagoon from 500cal. BCE to 200cal.

Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.","","article","","91","","","Societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in European Seas","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661111000383","0079-6611","2011","1-33","Progress in Oceanography"

Data for key air pollutants (CO, NO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5) measured over 7years (2008/2014) across 43 sites in Veneto were processed to characterise their spatial and temporal patterns and assess the air quality. Nitrogen oxides, PM and ozone are critical pollutants frequently breaching the EC limit and target values. Intersite analysis demonstrates a widespread pollution across the region and shows that primary pollutants (nitrogen oxides, CO, PM) are significantly higher in cities and over the flat lands due to higher anthropogenic pressures. The spatial variation of air pollutants at rural sites was then mapped to depict the gradient of background pollution: nitrogen oxides are higher in the plain area due to the presence of strong diffuse anthropogenic sources, while ozone increases toward the mountains probably due to the higher levels of biogenic ozone-precursors and low NO emissions which are not sufficient to titrate out the photochemical O3. Data-depth classification analysis revealed a poor categorization among urban, traffic and industrial sites: weather and urban planning factors may cause a general homogeneity of air pollution within cities driving this poor classification. Seasonal and diurnal cycles were investigated: the effect of primary sources in populated areas is evident throughout the region and drives similar patterns for most pollutants: road traffic appears the predominant potential source shaping the daily cycles. Trend analysis of experimental data reveals a general decrease of air pollution across the region, which agrees well with changes assessed by emission inventories. This study provides key information on air quality across NE Italy and highlights future research needs and possible developments of the regional monitoring network.","","article","","576","","","Air quality across a European hotspot: Spatial gradients, seasonality, diurnal cycles and trends in the Veneto region, NE Italy","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716322082","0048-9697","2017","210-224","Science of The Total Environment"

Mesoscale convection is an important and ubiquitous process on scales of motion spanning a few kilometers to many hundreds of kilometers. It plays a role in the input of energy to the climate system through the radiative effect of upper-tropospheric cloud and water vapor, and enhanced surface fluxes. This is in addition to its important effect on energy, heat and momentum transport within the atmosphere. However, mesoscale convection is neither parameterized nor adequately resolved in atmospheric general circulation models. Its representation in mean-flow terms raises issues that are quite distinct from classical approaches to sub-grid scale convection parameterization. Cloud-resolving modeling and theoretical concepts pertinent to the transport properties and mean-flow effects of organized convection are summarized, as are the main convective parameterization techniques used in global models. Two principal themes that are relevant to the representation of organized mesoscale systems are discussed. First, mesoscale transports and their sub-grid scale approximation with emphasis on dynamical approaches. Second, long time-scale modeling of mesoscale cloud systems that involves the collective effect of convection, boundary and surface layers, radiation, microphysics acting under the influence of large-scale forcing. Finally, major research programs that address the role of precipitating convection and mesoscale processes in global models are summarized.","","article","","35","","","Mesoscale convection from a large-scale perspective","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169809594000123","0169-8095","1995","87-112","Atmospheric Research"

The measurements are made in a corridor along the planned tunnel line for the later realized bored tunnel through the till deposits under the East Channel of the Great Belt in Denmark. The investigation was made in 1987–1988 on the initiative of A/S Storebæltsforbindelsen in order to prepare its tendering for the bored tunnel. The purpose was to make a prediction of the density of boulders of maximal dimension above any specified length. The properties of the seismic measuring device and its graphical registrations on seismograms do not make a proper interpretation possible without detailed knowledge about the joint distribution of the primary dimensions of the boulders. Therefore, separate measurements were made of the dimensions of boulders deposited visibly on the cliff beaches of the Great Belt. The surprisingly simple results from the analysis of the data from this separate measuring program are reported in a companion paper. Based on the revealed geographical universality of the joint dimension distribution it is anticipated that the same distribution is applicable for the till deposits along the tunnel line. By use of this important distribution information and of the observed homogeneity of the seismic point source field together with the physical properties of diffraction it became possible to make the wanted prediction. During the excavation, the found boulders were counted and measured. These direct observations on site confirmed that the prediction was quite good.","","article","","20","","","A story about estimation of a random field of boulders from incomplete seismic measurements","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266892005000287","0266-8920","2005","342-354","Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics"

In this study, continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence were used to analyse the runoff periodicity and relationship with climate indices, respectively. Additionally, the double mass curve (DMCD), the slope changing ratio of cumulative quantity (SCRCQ) and the Choudhury–Yang equation (Budyko-CY) methods for different potential evapotranspiration data (E0(E0-20 cm, E0-PM, E0-H)) were used to separate the impacts of climate changes and anthropogenic activities on runoff variations. The results demonstrated that the flow regimes in high and low flow seasons were not obvious shifts, and that after implementation of the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP), ecosystems were gradually restored in the downstream portion of the Heihe River Basin (DHRB). Periodicities of 1–7 years and 1–5.8 years were detected in Yingluoxia and Zhengyixia, respectively. Additionally, on a 1–148.2 month timescale, the monthly runoff with AO, NAO, PDO, and AMO had significant resonance periodicity and a 1–48 month Spearman's lag correlation. On the annual and high-flow, climate changes dominant determinant to an increase of runoff for the DMCD and Budyko-CY in period 2, SCRCQ and Budyko-CY in period 3 for different E0 in the upstream (UHRB). In the midstream (MHRB) region, anthropogenic activities played a dominant role in deducing the runoff by the SCRCQ and Budyko-CY methods for different E0 values in period 3. During the low-flow season, the impact of human activities in the UHRB and climate changes in the MHRB was significant for period 2 and 3. Therefore, the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes caused by the introduction of different E0 on different timescales should be fully considered in the future.","","article","","688","","","Runoff variation characteristics, association with large-scale circulation and dominant causes in the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719324507","0048-9697","2019","361-379","Science of The Total Environment"

On young soils developing along the recessional path left by the Skaftafellsjökull glacier, SE-Iceland, we investigated the accretion of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N), representing an age chronosequence of 120years. In total, 54 sampling sites were distributed along three moraines deposited in 1890, 1945, and 2003. For comparison, soil samples were collected from nearby birch woodlands (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), representing soils in a mature ecosystem likely to establish on the moraines in the future. Results show that the average SOC and N concentrations increase with time and at faster rates over the latter part of the chronosequence period investigated (1945–1890). After 120yrs, the soil contains 1.1kgCm−2 in the surface layer (0–10cm), which is still about one third of the 3.2kgCm−2 in soil under the birch woodlands. The N stock estimated at 0.06kgNm−2 after 120yrs is almost one fourth of that under the woodlands. The data suggest that landscape affects vegetation establishment and in turn, both landscape and vegetation affect soil development. Thus, concentrations of SOC, N and noncrystalline oxalate extractable Al and Fe are higher within depressions in the proglacial landscape. The comparison of SOC stock in the moraine soils with that under the birch forest shows that the young proglacial soils still have a large potential to accrete SOC within the developing pedosphere. With the observed accrual rate of 9.1gCm−2yr−1 in the top at 10cm, it may take the moraine soils an additional period of 220yrs to accrue SOC stocks comparable with those under the birch forest. Given the fact that all Icelandic glaciers are receding, assessing SOC accretion in new soil formation may be important to off-setting the greenhouse gas emissions.","","article","","228","","","Soil carbon accretion along an age chronosequence formed by the retreat of the Skaftafellsjökull glacier, SE-Iceland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X14004577","0169-555X","2015","124-133","Geomorphology"

We focus on the Plio-Quaternary landscape evolution of the eastern part of the Ligurian Alps with the goal of defining the active tectonics through an analysis of topography, drainage networks, and river long profiles. The Ligurian Alps have a steep, seaward-facing escarpment with topographic features reminiscent of the geomorphic markers preserved on both actively-uplifting coastlines and passive margins. For example, there are seaward-facing benches that are thought to be uplifted marine terraces common to active margins; but the drainage divide of the seaward escarpment shows clear evidence of recent northward migration into the Po foreland, a process consistent with escarpment retreat characteristic of passive or subsiding margins. This study explores the active tectonics consistent with these diverse landscape evolution pathways. Our analysis reveals that rock-type strongly throttles the development of topographic relief, drainage networks, and northward migration of the drainage divide. However, we also identify segments of the escarpment that indicate recent base level falls through an analysis of modeled channel steepness and comparison with mean hillslope gradient. The base level falls are consistent with numerous barbed tributaries that are best explained as recent stream captures. No significant correlation among the stream captures at the drainage divide, suspected marine terraces at the coast, Ligurian Sea bathymetry, and active seismicity indicates that the escarpment is the footwall of a segmented normal fault. This normal fault is embedded in a regionally subsiding margin where actively uplifting segments lead to a straightened, pinned drainage divide, whereas, relatively inactive segments permit divide migration into the footwall block. These results are broadly consistent with rock uplift increasing eastward toward Genova across the long-suspected Alps–Apennine Sestri–Voltaggio fault zone. They highlight the respective roles of legacy structures, rock-type, and localized rock uplift in constructing a landscape in an otherwise extending and subsiding crustal retrowedge of an active subduction plate boundary.","","article","","149-150","","","DEM analyses and morphotectonic interpretation: The Plio-Quaternary evolution of the eastern Ligurian Alps, Italy","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X12000232","0169-555X","2012","27-40","Geomorphology"

Today, managers at MORA seek to better manage current fire activity; however, this requires an improved understanding of past fire activity on the mountain. In this study high-resolution macroscopic charcoal analysis and pollen analysis of lake sediment records was used to reconstruct the postglacial fire and vegetation history for the Sunrise Ridge area of MORA. Fire activity was lowest during the Late Glacial when vegetation was sparse and climate was cool and dry. Fire activity increased during the early Holocene as the regional climate warmed and dried, and burnable biomass became more abundant. Fire activity continued to increase into the middle Holocene (until ca. 6600 cal yr BP) even as the regional climate became wetter and eventually cooler; the modern-day mesic forest and subalpine meadow landscapes of the park established at this time. Fire activity was generally highest and mean fire return intervals were lowest on Sunrise Ridge during the late Holocene, and are consistent with tree-ring based estimates of fire frequency. The similarity between the Sunrise Ridge and other paleofire records in the Pacific Northwest suggests that broad-scale climatic shifts, such as the retreat of the Cordilleran ice sheet and changes in annual insolation, as well as increased interannual climate variability (i.e., drought) particularly in the middle to late Holocene, were responsible for changes in fire activity during the postglacial period.

This lagoon receives river inputs, oceanic water arrivals, and erosion pressure from ultramafic rocks, enriched in nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co). The aim of this study was to characterize colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as well as to determine its main sources and its possible relationships (through the use of Pearson correlation coefficients, r) with biogeochemical parameters, plankton communities and trace metals in the NC eastern lagoon. Water samples were collected in March 2016 along a series of river/lagoon/open-ocean transects. The absorption coefficient at 350nm (a350) revealed the influence of river inputs on the CDOM distribution. The high values of spectral slope (S275–295, >0.03m−1) and the low values of specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254, <4Lmg-C−1m−1) highlighted the photodegradation of CDOM in surface waters. The application of parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) on excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) allowed the identification of four CDOM components: (1) one humic- and one tyrosine-like fluorophores. They had terrestrial origin, exported through rivers and undergoing photo- and bio-degradation in the lagoon. These two fluorophores were linked to manganese (Mn) in southern rivers (r=0.46–0.50, n=21, p<0.05). (2) A tryptophan-like fluorophore, which exhibited higher levels offshore. It would be potentially released from the coral reef. (3) A second tyrosine-like (“tyrosine 2-like”) fluorophore. Linked to Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria (r=0.39, n=47, p<0.05), this fluorophore would have an oceanic origin and enter in the lagoon through its southern and northern extremities. It also displayed relationships with Ni and Co content (r=0.53–0.54, n=21, p<0.05). This work underlines the diversity of CDOM sources in the NC eastern lagoon.","","article","","616-617","","","Characterization and sources of colored dissolved organic matter in a coral reef ecosystem subject to ultramafic erosion pressure (New Caledonia, Southwest Pacific)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717329790","0048-9697","2018","438-452","Science of The Total Environment"

The surface of Earth was a “Fire Ball”, during most of the Hadean period (4.5 to 4 billion years ago [bya]) in Earth’s early history. The early Earth’s atmosphere was filled with greenhouse gases, particularly methane Genesis of water on Earth about 3.8 bya is attributed to two major reasons, (1) mantle evolution, and (2) water brought to Earth by comets and asteroids. Formation of ocean by accumulation of water was attended by tidal oscillations, generated under the gravitational influence of Sun and Moon, which caused tidal currents and mixing of water in the ocean. Microbes appeared on Earth about 3.7 bya. Stromatolites (a laminated sedimentary fossil formed from alternating layers of microbes that live in seawater) appeared on Earth about 3.5 bya. Plate tectonics (large-scale motion of the plates making up the Earth’s lithosphere) occurred between 3.5 and 3.3 bya. The Great Oxidation Event, which occurred from the rise of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere ~2.4–2.0 bya, generally thought to be a result of oxygenic photosynthesis by cyanobacteria, resulted in banded iron formations composed of thin alternating layers of chert—a fine-grained form of silica & iron oxides, magnetite, and hematite. Earth’s surface became entirely frozen, and was fully covered with thick ice (Snowball Earth event) ~750 to 635 million years ago [mya]. Multiple mass extinction events, affecting widespread taxa and causing at least temporary declines in their diversity, occurred on Earth during multiple time-intervals spanning between ~ 440 to 66 mya. As a result of a massive input of carbon, a sharp global warming and ocean acidification occurred ∼56 mya. Volcano eruptions on land caused atmospheric cooling and those underwater caused abnormal atmospheric warming. The ill-famous Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) event gave rise to an approximately 170,000-year-long period of global warming about 56 mya.","","incollection","Elsevier","","Water Worlds in the Solar System","978-0-323-95717-5","Chapter 2 - Geological timeline of significant events on Earth","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323957175000207","","2023","55-114",""

Fifteen tests were performed all indicating that sand production resulted in an enlarged cavity that was cone-shaped. The cone extended to the top surface of the sand with a slope angle of about 35°. Typically, the improvement in the steady state flowrate was ten fold. These results indicate that sand production can provide a cost effective means of boosting production by altering the permeability characteristics of the formation and the flow regime (from a predominantly spherical to radial flow situation). The centrifuge tests neither captured the conditions resulting in formation of long erosional channels nor the several orders of magnitude improvement in production as inferred from some field projects in the Clearwater oil sand formation.

Rather than focusing solely on seasonal changes, the authors consider other harmonic changes using Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE), which reduces uncertainty in trends by 5–15%. Tropospheric NO2 observed from OMI demonstrated a downward trend in Austin (−0.06±0.02×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Dallas (−0.21±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Fort Worth (−0.16±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Houston (−0.14±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), and San Antonio (−0.07±0.02×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1). These decreasing trends could be attributed to efficient emission control policies. The OMI HCHO observations exhibited both negative and positive annual trends in Austin (+0.09±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Dallas (−0.01±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Fort Worth (−0.04±0.04×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), Houston (−0.06±0.05×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1), and San Antonio (+0.01±0.03×1015 molecules cm−2yr−1) mainly resulting from differences in decreases in anthropogenic emissions, the impact of climatic variations and biogenic emissions. The discrepancy between the annual trends of HCHO and NO2 provides strong evidence that all of the cities gradually became more NOx-sensitive. We obtained the slope of HCHO/NO2 ratios (a proxy for chemical condition) from OMI for Austin (0.10±0.04yr−1), Dallas (0.08±0.03yr−1), Fort Worth (0.07±0.03yr−1), Houston (0.06±0.03yr−1), and San Antonio (0.08±0.03yr−1) and investigate the 1–2pm local time surface ozone patterns along with maximum, annual, and minimum trends in relation to changes in their precursors and prevailing chemical conditions. The surface levels of wintertime ozone measured by the CAMS network were seen to increase in Austin (0.90±0.53ppbvyr−1), Dallas (0.62±0.53ppbvyr−1), Fort Worth (0.59±0.40ppbvyr−1), Houston (0.56±0.55ppbvyr−1), and San Antonio (0.64±0.54ppbvyr−1) because of the reduction in the amount of ozone quenched through NOx titration. Summertime ozone surface mixing ratio trends are mainly governed by NO2 annual trends as well as climatic influences. We obtained the downward annual trend of the ozone mixing ratio from CAMS observations for Austin (−0.27±0.17ppbvyr−1), Dallas (−0.41±0.18ppbvyr−1), Fort Worth (−0.55±0.18ppbvyr−1), Houston (−0.53±0.18ppbvyr−1), and San Antonio (−0.03±0.16ppbvyr−1). The results show that prevailing chemical conditions control the annual trends of surface ozone. While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO2 levels, a more prevailing NOx-sensitive regime over Austin resulted in its greater sensitivity to NO2 changes. The dominant NOx-saturated regime over Dallas, however, led to its lower sensitivity to high annual downward trends of OMI NO2. To investigate the impact of reductions in ozone precursors on surface ozone, we employ the WRF-Chem regional model to simulate NO2, HCHO, and O3 levels in September 2013 in two scenarios using National Emissions Inventory 2005 (NEI-2005) and NEI-2011 anthropogenic emissions. The model describes a decrease in ozone levels from the first to second scenario in Dallas (3%) and Forth Worth (0.5%) but an increase in Austin, San Antonio, and Houston (0.7%, 0.8%, and 7%, respectively), which may be attributed to uncertainty in VOC concentrations and overestimation of NOx in the NEI-2005 inventory that led to inaccurate HCHO/NO2 ratios. The results indicate that the emission uncertainties should be constrained to better inform emissions control policy based on air quality modeling.","","article","","168","","","Chemical condition and surface ozone in large cities of Texas during the last decade: Observational evidence from OMI, CAMS, and model analysis","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425715300559","0034-4257","2015","90-101","Remote Sensing of Environment"

We used the empirical and rational pollen percentage limits to infer the local presence and population expansion/recession times. Our results show that Pinus mugo and P. sylvestris spread first at 15,100 cal yr BP in the mountain. P. mugo arrived at high altitudes (1740 m) already at 13,600 cal yr BP. The expansion of Larix decidua was weakly recorded in the pollen diagrams, but the plant macrofossil and stomata records suggested its Late Glacial expansion mainly on the northern slope and local presence since 14,900 cal yr BP at 1740 m. The species likely went extinct in the Late Holocene (around 3330 cal yr BP). The expansion of Picea abies and Ulmus commenced earlier on the southern slope, from 15,200 to 14,400 cal yr BP respectively, compared to the northern slope, where these species expanded from 14,300 to 13,850 cal yr BP. The following step was the expansion of Quercus at 13,900 cal yr BP. Following the Younger Dryas decrease of temperate deciduous taxa and P. abies, their expansion on the northern flank was in the order of P. abies (11,750), Ulmus (11,600), Quercus (11,100), Corylus (10,600), Carpinus betulus (7100), Abies alba (5100) and Fagus sylvatica (5000 cal yr BP). Timing of the Early Holocene tree expansions on the southern flank is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the Early Holocene age-depth model of Lake Lia; however, the mid-Holocene expansion of C. betulus and A. alba were well-dated in both southern slope pollen records to 7700 and 6100 cal yr BP, respectively, and we inferred several hundred years earlier expansion on the southern flank that can be explained by climatic differences. Higher solar radiation results in longer growing seasons and milder winters on the southern flank, which likely facilitated the earlier spread of these trees. For several woody taxa studied in this paper, last glacial maximum refugial populations can be inferred either locally in the mountain (P. abies, P. mugo, P. sylvestris, L. decidua) or in the region (Quercus, Ulmus, C. betulus, F. sylvatica) on the basis of their pollen presence since at least 15,700–16,000 cal yr BP and early increase during the LG. We compared the pollen inferred population expansion times of several tree taxa along a south-north transect in the Romanian Carpathians, and found that the Early Holocene high altitude expansion of A. alba (10,650–9400 cal yr BP) is exceptional in the region. We also demonstrated that the Holocene mass expansion of Quercus and C. avellana started earliest in the Retezat, and at least two centuries later in other sites in the Romanian Carpathians. We also demonstrated that certain tree species had preference for survival and/or early expansion on the northern slopes (A. alba, L. decidua, F. sylvatica), while others on the southern slopes (C. avellana, C. betulus).","","article","","477","","","Timing of major forest compositional changes and tree expansions in the Retezat Mts during the last 16,000 years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618217311801","1040-6182","2018","40-58","Quaternary International"

This facilitates both an examination of responses from within each country and a cross-national comparison of ethics and taxation. Although there is a similarity of perception of the importance of a number of taxation related ethical issues between UK practitioners and Turkish practitioners, there are also several statistically significant differences between the two groups. The paper makes a significant contribution to the literature through obtaining and analysing data from tax professionals in the UK and Turkey to provide a cross-national study of corporate tax practice and ethics.

At UNAM, rainwater was collected for the entire rainy season period each year, while at RV, technical considerations limited collection to weekends only. The results showed large variations in rainwater chemical composition in most years, mainly because of the variability of meteorological conditions and also because of changes in source emissions. Sulfates and NH4+ showed higher annual volume-weighted mean concentrations (VWMC) in both sites. At UNAM, the maximum annual VWMC for SO42− occurred in March and the minimum in July and August. Lower concentrations of almost all ions were found at RV; however, the H+ concentration was higher at this site. The pH in Mexico City, calculated from the annual VWMC of H+, was 4.95, which is a little higher than pH values reported in some other countries. Despite the fact that sulfate and NO3− concentrations were lower at RV, the pH was lower. Air-mass back trajectories were calculated for individual concentrations of SO42−, H+, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, observed at each sampling site for weekend data. At RV, sulfate concentrations were higher when air-mass back trajectories indicated a wind flow from Mexico City and Toluca at 1000 MAGL (meters above ground level) and 3000 MAGL. The hydrogen ion exhibited the same behavior. Calcium and Mg2+ concentrations were also higher when the wind blew from urban areas at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. At UNAM, H+ concentration was lower and Ca2+ and Mg2+ were higher when wind blew from the northern sector of the city at 1000 and 3000 MAGL. In UNAM, the NO3−/SO42− and NH4+/SO42− ratios were 0.5 and 1.09 in 1994 and 0.86 and 1.64 in 2000, respectively, indicating a decrease in SO2 emissions resulting from the change of fuel oil to gas fuel. The SO42−/Ca2+ ratio was significantly lower at the UNAM site (1.82) compared to RV (5.36), and the SO42−/H+ ratio was significantly higher at the UNAM site (6.77) compared to RV (2.01). The Spearman's rho correlation between ionic concentrations indicated a positive correlation in most cases (p<0.05) for data from UNAM and RV. The multiple regression correlation analysis to predict H+ concentration in Mexico City showed that NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, and Ca2+ contributed 23.2%, 20.9%, 8.0%, and 6.1%, respectively, to the H+ prediction, while Cl− plus Na+ plus K+ only contributed 2.2%, and Mg2+ did not contribute. Sea-salt contribution to rainwater chemical composition was negligible with any wind direction at both levels. Excess sulfate (non-sea-salt sulfate) represented 98.7% of the total sulfate in rainwater collected during weekends at RV and 98.6% for weekend and annual rain samples at UNAM.","","article","","80","","","Rainwater chemical composition at two sites in Central Mexico","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809505001833","0169-8095","2006","67-85","Atmospheric Research"

However, most of these waves do not evolve in tropical depressions, storms, or hurricanes. The reasons why only few AEWs develop and the necessary conditions for cyclogenetic evolution are still the subject of intense debate. Tropical cyclogenesis occurring near the Cape Verde Islands in the eastern tropical Atlantic is investigated here with five seasons (July–August–September of 2004–2008) of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses, Meteosat-9 images, and National Hurricane Center (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Centers for Environmental Prediction) “best track” archives. The nine named storms that first reached tropical depression intensity east of 30°W, and two among six which developed between 30 and 40°W, during these five years evolved from intense AEW troughs, associated with low-level cyclonic circulation, weak mid-level anticyclonic Saharan flow to the east, and deep convection near the center of cyclonic vorticity. The cyclogenetic evolution of three AEW troughs, which verified these conditions but failed to develop into named storms, was probably inhibited by unusually dry environment and strong vertical wind shear. The fate of other AEW troughs, which did not satisfy the necessary conditions, is also discussed.","","article","","100","","","Characteristics of African easterly waves associated with tropical cyclogenesis in the Cape Verde Islands region in July–August–September of 2004–2008","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809511000056","0169-8095","2011","61-82","Atmospheric Research"

Organotins are pollutants that are used as biocides in antifouling paints. They produce endocrine-disrupting effects in mollusks, such as imposex. In rodents, organotin exposure induces developmental and reproductive toxicity as well as alteration of metabolic homeostasis through its action as an obesogen. The adverse effects that appear in rodents have raised concerns about organotins’ potential health risk to humans in relation to organotin exposure. At present, triorganotin, such as tributyltin, have been demonstrated to produce imposex, and mammalian reproductive and metabolic toxicity. For most mammals, triorganotin exposure predominantly occurs through the ingestion, and this compound can cross the placenta. With these risks in mind, it is important to improve our knowledge of organotins’ effects on environmental health.","","article","","36","","","Organotins: A review of their reproductive toxicity, biochemistry, and environmental fate","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890623812003450","0890-6238","2013","40-52","Reproductive Toxicology"

The study was conducted on the Atlantic coast of Morocco at two selected points along Safi shores, a supposed clean station and a recognized metal-contaminated one. The main objectives were to assess the pollution status of these two stations and to highlight the environmental and human risks associated with metal contamination. The bioavailability and the bioaccumulation of the selected metals, several physiological and biometric parameters of mussels were assessed at both sampling stations. As expected, the station located near industry plants showed the highest metal concentrations in the two compartments and was associated with lower values in the physiological and biometric indices. At the mussel scale, inter-station and inter-tissue variations in metal concentrations were observed showing a preferential accumulation within the digestive gland. Besides, strong reliable negative relations of Cd and Cu concentrations were obtained with physiological indices. Surprisingly, a significant occurrence of both selected metals was recorded at the location assumed as a reference station. Therefore, the hypothesis that this station presumed to be clean and currently used as a control station must be reconsidered. As for the risk for the consumer, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of Cd and Cu indicated a potential health risk through mussel consumption since the EDI values were markedly above the international guidelines and threshold levels for human consumption. Finally, our data were compared to those previously obtained along the Safi coastline (NW Morocco) and other geographical regions, including the Mediterranean and western Atlantic areas within the temperate zone.","","article","","40","","","Assessment of trace metal contamination in surficial fine-grained sediments and mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis from Safi areas in the northwestern Atlantic coast of Morocco","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352485520306630","2352-4855","2020","101535","Regional Studies in Marine Science"

Our study indicates that the number of human settlements found scattered over the peninsula have quadrupled from the prehistoric to historical periods and that this evolution occurred over periods of climate change and seismo–tectonic activity. We show that societal development occurs both during periods of harsh as well as favourable climatic conditions. At some times, some settlements develop while others decline. Well-known climate events such as the 4.2 ka and 3.2 ka events are recognizable in some of the palaeoclimatic records and a regional decline in the number and sizes of settlements occurs roughly at the same time, but their precise chronological fit with the archaeological record remains uncertain. Local socio-political processes were probably always the key drivers behind the diverse strategies that human societies took in times of changing climate. The study thus reveals considerable chronological parallels between societal development and palaeoenvironmental records, but also demonstrates the ambiguities in these correspondences and, in doing so, highlights some of the challenges that will face future interdisciplinary projects. We suggest that there can be no general association made between societal expansion phases and periods of advantageous climate. We also propose that the relevance of climatic and environmental regionality, as well as any potential impacts of seismo-tectonics on societal development, need to be part of the interpretative frameworks.","","article","","136","","","The socio-environmental history of the Peloponnese during the Holocene: Towards an integrated understanding of the past","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379115301633","0277-3791","2016","40-65","Quaternary Science Reviews"

A mutli-proxy data set including geochronology, diatoms, pigments and carbonate stable isotopes indicates warmer and wetter conditions than present in the early part of the record. We interpret this as Marine Isotope Stage 5e after application of a chronological age-depth model and similar ice core evidence. Dry and cold conditions are inferred during the last glacial, with lake-level minima, floristic changes towards a shallow water algal community, and a greater biological receipt of ultraviolet radiation. During the Last Glacial Maximum and Termination I the lake was perennially ice-covered, with minimal snowmelt in the catchment. After ca. 10,500 cal yr B.P., the lake became seasonally moated or ice-free during summer.

Geomorphological changes in the study area may also be associated with global climate events, sea-level fluctuations or anthropogenic periods in the Turia catchment. Six phases may be differentiated: (1) a major early alluviation phase during the Iberian period, when the Turia river ran to the north of the coastal plain and sand spits closed the Valencia open lagoon environments, forming a permeable barrier (2800 BP to 2300 BP approximately); (2) an avulsion phase of the Turia river to the south at the end of the Roman period (4th century AD); (3) formation of a more advanced spit just behind the most recent barrier during the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA, Visigothic period); (4) a flood period of high-magnitude with coarser sediments throughout the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 11th century AD), when La Punta meridional deltaic ridge developed, which can be related to beach ridge closing and marine isolation of the Valencia lagoon around the 12th century; (5) important river alluviation and growth of the recent coastal barrier favoured by Turia channel changes during the Middle Ages, in the early Little Ice Age (LIA); (6) rapid coastal progradation and decline in salinity in the Valencia lagoon between the Maunder sunspot minimum (MM) and the end of LIA.","","article","","219","","","Turia river delta and coastal barrier-lagoon of Valencia (Mediterranean coast of Spain): Geomorphological processes and global climate fluctuations since Iberian-Roman times","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379119303166","0277-3791","2019","84-101","Quaternary Science Reviews"

However, SWE estimation based solely on remote sensing, modeling, or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements. In this context, this study develops a data-fusion framework that combines multi-source datasets including satellite-observed daily mean fractional snow-covered area (DMFSCA), snow pillow SWE measurements, physiographic data, and historical SWE patterns into a linear regression model (LRM) to improve SWE estimates in real-time. We test two LRMs: a baseline regression model (LRM-baseline) that uses physiographic data and historical SWE patterns as independent variables, and an FSCA-informed regression model (LRM-FSCA) that includes the DMFSCA from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery as an additional independent variable. By incorporating the satellite-observed DMFSCA, LRM-FSCA outperforms LRM-baseline with increased median R2 from 0.54 to 0.60, and reduced median PBIAS of basin average SWE from 2.6% to 2.2% in the snow pillow SWE cross-validation. LRM-FSCA explains 87% of the variance in the snow course SWE measurements with 0.1% PBIAS, while LRM-baseline explains a lower 81% variance with 1.4% PBIAS, both of which show higher accuracy than SWE estimates from the two operational SWE datasets: the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS, 73% and -2.4%, respectively) and Nationtional Water Model (NWM, 75% and -15.9%, respectively). Additionally, LRM-FSCA explains 85% of the median variance in the Airborne Snow Observatory SWE with -9.2% PBIAS, which is comparable to the LRM-baseline (86% and -11.3%, respectively) and considerably better than SNODAS (64% and 28.2%, respectively) and NWM (33% and -30.1%, respectively). This study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow-cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi-source observations in real-time SWE estimation. The developed SWE estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in California, where climate extremes (e.g., droughts and floods) require particularly skillful monitoring practices.","","article","","160","","","Combining ground-based and remotely sensed snow data in a linear regression model for real-time estimation of snow water equivalent","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030917082100227X","0309-1708","2022","104075","Advances in Water Resources"

The improvement of safety at RLCs is of crucial importance worldwide. This paper proposes a new approach for evaluating safety at RLCs using non-radial DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) model. The introduced non-radial DEA model is employed for the evaluation of railway efficiency of European countries regarding the level of safety at RLCs through considering desirable and undesirable inputs, as well as desirable and undesirable outputs for the period from 2010 to 2012 and for the year 2014. Due to missing the comprehensive set of data for roadway traffic, the evaluation of safety at railway RLCs has been conducted from railway viewpoint. Through the application of modified non-radial DEA model, results indicate the most efficient countries, as well as countries with a lower efficiency of railway performance in terms of the level of safety at RLCs. In order to check the validity of modified non-radial DEA model, comparison of results and sensitivity analysis were conducted. Despite the validity, results of the sensitivity analysis indicated also some weaknesses of the modified non-radial DEA model related to missing and inaccurate data, the number of variables included, and the selection of inputs and outputs.

Security experts manually define different types of rules and scripts based on CTI to perform validation tasks. These rules and scripts need to be updated continuously due to evolving threats, changing SOCs’ requirements and dynamic nature of CTI. The manual process of updating rules and scripts delays the response to attacks. To reduce the burden of human experts and accelerate response, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) based framework, SmartValidator. SmartValidator leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enable automated validation of alerts. It consists of three layers to perform the tasks of data collection, model building and alert validation. It projects the validation task as a classification problem. Instead of building and saving models for all possible requirements, we propose to automatically construct the validation models based on SOC’s requirements and CTI. We built a Proof of Concept (PoC) system with eight ML algorithms, two feature engineering techniques and 18 requirements to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of SmartValidator. The evaluation results showed that when prediction models were built automatically for classifying cyber threat data, the F1-score of 75% of the models were above 0.8, which indicates adequate performance of the PoC for use in a real-world organization. The results further showed that dynamic construction of prediction models required 99% less models to be built than pre-building models for all possible requirements. Thus, SmartValidator is much more efficient to use when SOCs’ requirements and threat behaviour are constantly evolving. The framework can be followed by various industries to accelerate and automate the validation of alerts and incidents based on their CTI and SOC’s preferences.","","article","","202","","","SmartValidator: A framework for automatic identification and classification of cyber threat data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804522000340","1084-8045","2022","103370","Journal of Network and Computer Applications"

Object perception is the foundation for the automatic operations of submerged vehicles in dynamic aquatic environments. However, underwater perception encounters multiple environmental challenges, including rapid light attenuation, light refraction, or back-scattering effect. These problems reduce the sensing devices’ signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making underwater perception a complicated research topic. This paper describes the state-of-the-art sensing technologies and object perception techniques for underwater robots in different environmental conditions. Due to the current sensing modalities’ various constraints and characteristics, we divide the perception ranges into close-range, medium-range, and long-range. We survey and describe recent advances for each perception range and suggest some potential future research directions worthy of investigating in this field.","","article","","267","","","Object perception in underwater environments: a survey on sensors and sensing methodologies","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801822024854","0029-8018","2023","113202","Ocean Engineering"

In this work, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to apportion PM2.5 levels at a traffic site (Msida) located in a coastal town. 180 filters collected throughout a yearly sampling campaign conducted in 2016, were chemically characterized by light absorbance analysis, x-ray fluorescence and ion chromatography in order to determine the concentrations of black carbon, 17 elements and 5 ions, respectively. The resulting chemical data base was used in conjunction with PMF in order to identify the 7 components affecting the PM2.5 levels at the receptor site. Six of these sources are considered to be typical of the atmospheric composition of coastal traffic sites: traffic (27.3%), ammonium sulfate (23.6%), Saharan dust (15%), aged sea salt (12.7%), shipping (5%) and fresh sea salt (4.6%). This is the first time that such a study was carried out in Malta and helps in understanding the aerosol pollution climate of the Central Mediterranean, which is still relatively understudied when compared to the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Furthermore, we have isolated a factor exclusive to Malta: the fireworks component, which is responsible for 2.9% of the PM2.5 and which has health implications due to its chemical composition. The results of this work should also serve to guide the policy makers in achieving the necessary emission reductions in order to achieve the WHO guideline for PM2.5 by 2020.","","article","","211","","","Estimation of the contributions of the sources driving PM2.5 levels in a Central Mediterranean coastal town","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653518313699","0045-6535","2018","465-481","Chemosphere"

However, in contrast to the mid- and low-latitudes, significantly less effort has been directed towards understanding the factors controlling D/H fractionation in high latitude plant waxes and the impact of these processes on the interpretation of sedimentary leaf wax δD records. To better understand these processes, we examined the D/H ratios of long chain fatty acids in lake surface sediments spanning a temperature and precipitation gradient on Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic. D/H ratios of plant waxes increase with increasing temperature and aridity, with values ranging from −240‰ to −160‰ over the study area. Apparent fractionation factors between n-alkanoic acids in Arctic lake sediments and precipitation(εFA-ppt) are less negative than those of mid-latitude lakes and modern plants by 25‰ to 65‰, consistent with n-alkane data from modern Arctic plants (Yang et al., 2011). Furthermore, εFA-ppt values from Arctic lakes become systematically more positive with increasing evaporation, in contrast to mid-latitude sites, which show little to no change in fractionation with aridity. These data are consistent with enhanced water loss and isotope fractionation at higher latitude in the Arctic summer, when continuous sunlight supports increased daily photosynthesis. The dominant control on δDFA variations on Baffin Island is temperature. However, changing εFA-ppt result in steeper δDFA–temperature relationships than observed for modern precipitation. The application of this δDFA-based paleotemperature calibration to existing δDFA records from Baffin Island produces much more realistic changes in late Holocene temperature and highlights the importance of these effects in influencing the interpretation of Arctic δDFA records. A better understanding of the controls on hydrogen isotope fractionation in high latitude leaf waxes will be essential to the proper interpretation of isotope records from sedimentary plant waxes in the Arctic.","","article","","119","","","Environmental controls on the 2H/1H values of terrestrial leaf waxes in the eastern Canadian Arctic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703713003190","0016-7037","2013","286-301","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

Although long-term, incremental changes in climate can have serious consequences, it is usually the extreme, surprising events that cause the most damage to human health and property. Different taxonomies of surprise are explored, drawing from literature concerning diverse aspects of human society. Surprise is revealed to be a subjective concept in many respects, triggered by such factors as prior experience, belief systems, and media exposure. How policymakers have reacted to climate surprises in the past is considered, particularly with regard to choices made between pro-active and reactive measures. It is concluded that, while some kinds of surprise are truly unpredictable, there are other types that could be anticipated and their adverse effects forestalled.","","article","","10","","","Exploring the concept of climate surprise","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378000000157","0959-3780","2000","97-107","Global Environmental Change"

For its accurate application, knowledge about the origin and preservation of Nd in sedimentary archives is crucial. Recently, concerns have emerged regarding the applicability of neodymium isotopes as a conservative palaeo water mass tracer, given potential Nd fluxes from sediments into bottom waters (Abbott et al., 2015a) and inferred relabelling of ocean waters by settling detrital material (Roberts and Piotrowski, 2015). Consequently, a decoupling of water mass provenance and proxy variations may arise. We investigate the mobility of Nd around extreme detrital sedimentation events such as glacial ice rafting pulses and turbidite deposition in the Northeast Atlantic. The constructed records from sediment leachates span extreme Nd isotope variations including volcanic (εNd ∼ 0) and Laurentian (εNd ∼ −27) sources. We find that Nd was released into pore waters from reactive detritus inside some detrital layers during early diagenesis, thereby overprinting any archived bottom water Nd signature and precluding the reconstruction of past water mass provenance during the affected time intervals. However, we do not observe any definite indication of diffusive vertical migration of Nd into adjacent layers. Furthermore, bottom water Nd isotope signatures were not modified to a measurable degree by any potential benthic flux of Nd during the deposition of these detrital sediment layers. Consequently, the Nd isotope composition of the pelagic glacial Northeast Atlantic water masses were resilient to such episodic large detrital fluxes. Apart from extreme local sedimentation events, we confirm the presence of detritally overprinted deep waters north of 47°N during the peak glacial from comparison of Northeast Atlantic depth transects. We furthermore suggest that the sensitivity of deep waters to this overprinting effect increased during periods of reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and elevated ice rafting. Overall, our study demonstrates that a thorough evaluation of the proportion of Nd originating from physical water mass advection versus in situ chemical inputs is crucial for the reliable application of Nd isotopes as a water mass tracer.","","article","","245","","","The resilience and sensitivity of Northeast Atlantic deep water εNd to overprinting by detrital fluxes over the past 30,000 years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703718306045","0016-7037","2019","79-97","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

As future climate change projections imply an increased risk of extreme events, the occurrence of droughts is potentially accelerating in the future. The influence of climate change on drought events in a Danish agricultural catchment under the emission scenario RCP8.5 are evaluated by three different drought indices covering soil moisture, groundwater and streamflow deficits. The indices are based on results from a hydrological model forced by downscaled climate outputs from 16 Euro-CORDEX climate models (GCM-RCMs), while considering uncertainties among climate model projections. The hydrological model demonstrated a satisfactory ability in modelling historical drought characteristics. The results from the future projections showed that the intensity and frequency of droughts increased towards the end of the century. The spatial patterns of changes in drought were found to be highly dependent on the climate model results, index formulations and assumptions, as well as the hydrogeological properties of the catchment. Groundwater based irrigation in the agricultural areas effectively mitigates soil moisture drought, leading to lower future uncertainty of the ensemble mean (higher model agreement) for soil moisture droughts at irrigated locations. This is obtained at the cost of lower groundwater levels in both reference and future periods resulting in larger uncertainties on the simulated groundwater droughts, because of the addition of irrigation uncertainty. While the joint impact of greater groundwater abstraction and changing dynamics of precipitation and groundwater recharge also leads to larger streamflow variability between model combinations (standard deviation) under RCP8.5 for the downstream discharge station.","","article","","601","","","Climate change impacts and uncertainty on spatiotemporal variations of drought indices for an irrigated catchment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421008647","0022-1694","2021","126814","Journal of Hydrology"

A cluster analysis is implemented to select independent GCMs and to decrease the high computational time of the urban flood modeling. A two-step spatiotemporal statistical downscaling based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution parameters is performed to meet the requirement of a fine-scale precipitation resolution for the urban flood simulations. Using the downscaled distribution parameters, the intensity–duration-frequency (IDF) curves and composite design storms for four return periods of 2, 10, 20 and 50 years are created to be used as the inputs of an InfoWorks ICM hydrodynamic model for a case study in Antwerp city, Belgium. The fraction of attributable risk (FAR) framework and the causal counterfactual probability theory are used to quantify anthropogenic climate influences on urban pluvial flooding. The results show that the GEV parameters of location and scale nicely follow the power relation, providing an opportunity for the temporal downscaling of precipitation extremes. A disagreement is found between the GCMs on the contribution of anthropogenic climate factors on pluvial flooding, some illustrating a higher probability of flooding due to anthropogenic climate impacts, and some a lower one. It can therefore be concluded that the urban flooding in Antwerp is not attributable to anthropogenic climate impacts.","","article","","598","","","Developing a framework for attribution analysis of urban pluvial flooding to human-induced climate impacts","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421003991","0022-1694","2021","126352","Journal of Hydrology"

PINNs are a deep learning architecture that incorporates physical information to provide an interpretable and physically-meaningful neural network model, making it well-suited for modeling offshore moored structures with high nonlinearity. The moored buoy is modeled as a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), and the general formulation of PINN for the system of ODEs is established. Two new metrics for motion estimation and system identification are proposed to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the implementation of PINN. The results demonstrate that PINN can accurately estimate motion and identify system parameters by choosing appropriate hyperparameters (HPs). This paper also investigates the effects of the number of layers, nodes, and learning rate on motion estimation and system identification to provide a benchmark for selecting optimal HPs. This study finds that hyperparameter optimization can reduce the relative error of identified parameters by up to two thousand times compared to no optimization. Motion estimation prefers large neural networks for all sea states, while at least three layers of neural networks are needed for accurate parameter identification. The paper also provides a look-up table to investigate further implementing PINN on moored floating offshore structures. Proper selection of HPs is crucial as it can incur up to three orders of magnitude PINN loss and exceedingly-high identification error. Overall, this study highlights the applicability of PINN in modeling complex offshore structures and provides insights into selecting optimal HPs for accurate and efficient estimation of motion and system parameters.","","article","","138","","","Motion estimation and system identification of a moored buoy via physics-informed neural network","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118723002183","0141-1187","2023","103677","Applied Ocean Research"

Real shipping logs from four container ships (two with 13000 TEUs and two with 5000 TEUs) over a six-month sailing period are used to exhibit the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The empirical studies demonstrate the performance of three models for fitting the fuel consumption rate of a ship and the industrial merits of ship fuel efficiency management. In addition, we highlight the potential impacts of the models developed in this study on liner shipping network analysis, as these models can serve as base models for additionally considering the influence of displacement and weather conditions on ship fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions.","","article","","83","","","Shipping log data based container ship fuel efficiency modeling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515002386","0191-2615","2016","207-229","Transportation Research Part B: Methodological"

The method enables an objective estimate (i.e. independent of population density and observational networks) of tornado climatology in forested regions. The method is based on the identification of narrow and elongated areas as forest disturbances obtained using Landsat satellite images and Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) data. These areas were subsequently verified with high-resolution satellite images for verification of a tornadic cause of forest damage. Landsat and MODIS satellite images, weather station observations and reanalysis data were additionally involved in order to determine tornado dates. A minimum F-scale tornado intensity was estimated by a Weibull distribution model using information on tornado path lengths and widths. The method is applied to the forested regions of northeast Europe, where 110 tornado tracks were identified between the 2000 and 2014years, 105 of which were previously unreported and discovered for the first time. For some regions, tornado density estimates using the new method is 2–3 times higher than other previously published estimates. The largest number of tornadoes occurred in 2009, and June is the most favourable month for tornado formation (including strong tornadoes and tornado outbreaks). Most identified tornadoes have path length <10km with maximum and mean widths of approximately 200–300m and 100–200m, respectively. A few tornadoes with long and wide paths were found; four of them likely had F3 minimal intensity.","","article","","204","","","A satellite-derived climatology of unreported tornadoes in forested regions of northeast Europe","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717304662","0034-4257","2018","553-567","Remote Sensing of Environment"

A central concern is that open-air tasks such as large scale animal processing may leave behind little or no macro evidence. Many tasks did, however, introduce chemical residues into underlying soils. Chemical surveys of these soils offer a minimally invasive, sustainable means of investigating large open-air spaces, which can provide evidence for the structured use of such spaces. Defining structuring in the use of space, in turn, contributes to clarifying site functions, seasonality, and residential mobility. Exemplifying this approach, we present results from ongoing soil chemistry studies at a 2000year old Taltheilei hunter–gatherer encampment in the Canadian Arctic. Samples were analyzed using X-ray florescence spectroscopy (XRF), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Patterning in the data was highlighted using principal component analysis (PCA) and inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW). Anomalous concentrations of CaO, MnO, P2O5, and Cu were discovered adjacent to dwellings, representing hearth cleaning episodes. Along with these, enrichments in K2O, MgO, Fe2O3, Sr, Sc, Y, Cr, Ni, and Pb provide support for the presence of open-air animal processing facilities. We have also identified several peaks in our FTIR spectra that reasonably indicate trans-fat derived from ruminant tissue. At this stage of research, anomalies are attributed to caribou processing and refuse disposal during late fall occupations. While we are hopeful that FTIR will continue to develop as a valuable means of identifying fats in archaeological contexts, additional work will strengthen our current argument for the presence of trans-fats in our samples.","","article","","17","","","Multi-element and biomolecular analyses of soils as a means of sustainable site structure research on hunter–gatherer sites: A case study from the Canadian Arctic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X15302005","2352-409X","2018","973-991","Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports"

Over the past decades, rapid warming has augmented atmospheric moisture fluxes. The resulting intensification of the hydrological cycle, as evident from instrumental records, is linked to more frequent and severe flooding. However, this observational baseline is too short to adequately assess long-term flood variability under different climate conditions. Geological archives can fill this critical knowledge gap by providing long-term (millennia) empirical constraints on the magnitude and frequency of floods. To reconstruct the frequency of flood events over the last >8000 years, this study investigated the Holocene lacustrine sediments from Lake Lygne in southwestern Norway. The precipitation in this area is sourced from the North Atlantic Ocean and transported by the prevalent westerly winds. As such, reconstructions of flood frequency variability may shed light on past moisture flux and flood generating weather systems in this part of northwestern Europe. We applied a multiproxy approach to robustly fingerprint the flood sediment signatures using multiple independent lines of evidence. This approach included analysing the sediments using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), computed tomography (CT scanning), and magnetic susceptibility (MS). We identified two types of event beds that differed significantly from background sedimentation throughout the sedimentary archive, which we interpreted as river flood deposits: one type is minerogenic and coarse silt-dominated; the other is a composite of minerogenic sediments and macrofossils. By comparing the sediment record with instrumental water discharge data from the last 100 years, we argue that these differing flood signals represent two flood regimes: rainfall-triggered floods during autumn and snowmelt-triggered floods during spring. Conducting a rate of change (RoC) analysis, we found significant millennial- and centennial-scale variability in the frequency of flood events. Moreover, comparing our findings with palaeoclimate reconstructions in the North Atlantic region, we found that the warmer than present early-mid-Holocene was dominated by extreme precipitation-triggered floods, shifting towards more snowmelt-triggered floods in the late Holocene.","","article","","290","","","Lake sediments from southern Norway capture Holocene variations in flood seasonality","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379122002748","0277-3791","2022","107643","Quaternary Science Reviews"

It is the subject of active research in many fields of study, such as computer science, data science, statistics, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Several clustering techniques have been proposed and implemented, and most of them successfully find excellent quality or optimal clustering results in the domains mentioned earlier. However, there has been a gradual shift in the choice of clustering methods among domain experts and practitioners alike, which is precipitated by the fact that most traditional clustering algorithms still depend on the number of clusters provided a priori. These conventional clustering algorithms cannot effectively handle real-world data clustering analysis problems where the number of clusters in data objects cannot be easily identified. Also, they cannot effectively manage problems where the optimal number of clusters for a high-dimensional dataset cannot be easily determined. Therefore, there is a need for improved, flexible, and efficient clustering techniques. Recently, a variety of efficient clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature, and these algorithms produced good results when evaluated on real-world clustering problems. This study presents an up-to-date systematic and comprehensive review of traditional and state-of-the-art clustering techniques for different domains. This survey considers clustering from a more practical perspective. It shows the outstanding role of clustering in various disciplines, such as education, marketing, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. It also discusses the application of clustering to different fields attracting intensive efforts among the scientific community, such as big data, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

On sub-tropical coasts, shifts in the sub-tropical ridge (STR) modulate the seasonal occurrence of different wave types. However, in semi-enclosed seas, isolating directional wave climates and synoptic drivers is hindered by a complex mixed sea-swell environment. Here we present a directional wave climate typology for the Tasman Sea based on a combined statistical-synoptic approach using mid-shelf wave buoy observations along the Southeast Australian Shelf (SEAS). Five synoptic-scale wave climates exist during winter, and six during summer. These can be clustered into easterly (Tradewind), south-easterly (Tasman Sea) and southerly (Southern Ocean) wave types, each with distinct wave power signatures. We show that a southerly shift in the STR and trade-wind zone, consistent with an observed poleward expansion of the tropics, forces an increase in the total wave energy flux in winter for the central New South Wales shelf of 1.9GJm–1 wave-crest-length for 1° southerly shift in the STR, and a reduction of similar magnitude (approximately 1.8GJm–1) during summer. In both seasons there is an anti-clockwise rotation of wave power towards the east and south-east at the expense of southerly waves. Reduced obliquity of constructive wave power would promote a general disruption to northward alongshore sediment transport, with the cross-shore component becoming increasingly prevalent. Results are of global relevance to sub-tropical east coasts where the modal wave climate is influenced by the position of the zonal STR.","","article","","98","","","Directional wave climate and power variability along the Southeast Australian shelf","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434315000461","0278-4343","2015","36-53","Continental Shelf Research"

Many symbolic major events have celebrated these developments, e.g., in Venice, Italy, the 15th (2006) and 20th (2012) years of progress and more recently, in 2018, in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 25 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry. On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and for hydrology. The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the “Green” Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments’ development and satellite missions’ evolutions are described in a fourth section. A fifth section covers the key observations that altimeters provide and their potential complements, from other Earth observation measurements to in situ data. Section 6 identifies the data and methods and provides some accuracy and resolution requirements for the wet tropospheric correction, the orbit and other geodetic requirements, the Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Mean Dynamic Topography, Calibration and Validation, data accuracy, data access and handling (including the DUACS system). Section 7 brings a transversal view on scales, integration, artificial intelligence, and capacity building (education and training).

Additionally, regional studies that present conflicting patterns for the onset and advancement of Mediterranean climatic conditions complicate definitively ascribing causality. Here, we use a new high resolution stalagmite density record obtained non-destructively using Computed Tomography (CT scanning) to reconstruct southern Iberian climate between 9.3 and 2.9 ka BP. We suggest that stalagmite density can be used as a water-excess proxy, with lower densities associated with more variable drip rates, possibly reflecting increased seasonality consistent with expectations from previous studies of speleothem textures and crystal fabrics. Our results reveal an early Holocene humid interval and mid-Holocene year-round aridity that preceded the onset of Mediterranean climate at 5.3 ka BP in southern Iberia. Using this new dataset combined with previously published results, we link the gradual advancement of the Mediterranean climate to the southward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High induced by an orbitally driven decrease in Northern Hemisphere insolation. Future anthropogenic warming could result in a reversal of this trend, a northward migration of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and a return to year-round aridity in south-western Europe.","","article","","127","","","Reconstructing high-resolution climate using CT scanning of unsectioned stalagmites: A case study identifying the mid-Holocene onset of the Mediterranean climate in southern Iberia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379115300226","0277-3791","2015","117-128","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Our goal was to test whether satellite remote sensing, which has been successful in locating large archaeological features associated with sedentary peoples, could be applied to arctic interior sites associated with mobile hunter–gatherers. In particular, we strove to develop a relatively straightforward and inexpensive model using existing data which could be used to help guide archaeology surveys. Using 1-m resolution IKONOS imagery of Lake Matcharak along the upper Noatak River, we produced a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and tasseled cap transformation of the study area and stacked these five vegetation indices into one image. We then applied unsupervised and supervised classifications to the image first, to test for the presence of a site-specific spectral class and second, determine the nature of that class. Through a visual analysis of the unsupervised classification, a spectral phenomenon was seen to co-occur with archaeological sites in the study area. The supervised classification provided a high-resolution land cover map used to identify the signature as the ecotone between un-vegetated sediments and dense willow (Salix sp.) stands. Dense willow stands along the Lake Matcharak shore visually correlate with most of the known archaeological sites, possibly reflecting landform and/or vegetation characteristics that would have appealed to past inhabitants.

Motivated by the stringent requirements on SST accuracy required for Climate Data Records (CDR) we quantify sampling errors in satellite SSTs. Infrared sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have sampling errors caused by incomplete coverage primarily due to clouds and inter-swath gaps (gaps between successive swaths/orbits). Unlike retrieval errors, the sampling errors are introduced when calculating mean values and in generating gap-free SST fields. We generate MODIS-sampled SST fields by superimposing MODIS cloud masks on top of the Multi-scale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) SST field for the same day. Based on the MODIS-sampled fields, we calculate sampling errors at different temporal and spatial resolutions to examine the impacts at different scales. Our results indicate that sampling errors are significant, more so in the high latitudes, especially the Arctic. The 30°N–30°S zonal band is found to have the smallest errors; a notable exception is the persistent negative errors found in the Tropical Instability Wave area, where the mesoscale ocean–atmosphere interaction leads to a more frequently satellite sampling above the cold sections of the wave area. The global mean sampling error is generally positive and increases approximately exponentially with missing data fraction at a fixed averaging interval, while error variability is mainly controlled by SST variability. Areas with persistent cloud cover have large sampling errors in temporally averaged SSTs. We conclude that the sampling error can be an important or even dominant component of the error budget of mean and gap-free SST fields. Climate data generation and interpretation of satellite-derived SST CDRs and their application must be conducted with due regard to the sampling error.","","article","","177","","","Sampling errors in satellite-derived infrared sea-surface temperatures.

Despite their importance as contributors to the global carbonate budget and as paleo-environmental indicators for water depth, pH, temperature and water energy, the mechanism of formation of these concentric, sub-spherical concretions of tangentially or radially arranged aragonite or calcite crystals is still the subject of intense debate. Unlike oncoids, whose microbial origins are well acknowledged, ooids are traditionally viewed as abiotic grains, mainly produced in suspension by agitated, warm waters that are supersaturated with respect to CaCO3. Yet, there is considerable evidence, including geochemical bio-signatures and detection of viable microbes capable of mineralization and biofilm production and degradation, to suggest otherwise. The emergence of new and sophisticated technologies reveals that the level of microbial diversity of these sedimentary grains exceeds that of some microbialite systems. These findings have refined our understanding of ooid genesis and ooid accretion processes and argue toward microbial mediation both as a direct result of metabolic activities inducing changes in the environment conducive to precipitation and by a passive mechanism, in which mucilaginous extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) act as a template for mineral nucleation. Furthermore, new developments in the field indicate that carbonate mineralization in marine ooids occurs through sequential precipitations that involve an amorphous calcium carbonate phase (ACC), which some argue are of biotic origins. Herein, we discuss the most relevant theories of ooid formation, including some of the early pioneering studies that laid the groundwork for new theories attempting to decode the origins of these controversial grains.","","article","","190","","","Decoding the mechanism of formation in marine ooids: A review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825218303738","0012-8252","2019","536-556","Earth-Science Reviews"

Subsamples were taken from the cages and the natural site at different time intervals (1, 2 and 5 months) to compare growth, imposex (a set of sexual anomalies caused by TBT) and butyltin concentrations accumulated in female tissues. Individuals in cages experienced negligible mortality and considerable growth. In addition, while the Relative Penis Size Index (RPSI, an index of imposex) remained consistent in the natural site through the experiment, it increased markedly at the implant sites; the same applies to the butyltin residues. These results are discussed to conclude that cage transplanting of N. lapillus is a suitable technique that can quickly (i.e. 1 month) detect differences in the level of TBT contamination among sites; however, extrapolation of experimental results to the field seems to require a longer exposure time (at least 5 months). Finally, the use of such an approach is deemed helpful to interpret the relationship between N. lapillus population dynamics and TBT pollution.","","article","","247","","","The use of Nucella lapillus (L.) transplanted in cages to monitor tributyltin (TBT) pollution","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969700003673","0048-9697","2000","227-237","Science of The Total Environment"

This goal is pursued by the Australian aquaculture, offshore engineering and renewable energy industries, research organisations and the government through the “Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre”. To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia’s unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on the identified gaps in the review process, potential areas for future research are introduced to enable a safer and more reliable operation of the MPOPs.","","article","","148","","","Reliability of multi-purpose offshore-facilities: Present status and future direction in Australia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582020318103","0957-5820","2021","437-461","Process Safety and Environmental Protection"

Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that Cu and Cr dominate the source apportionment in northern region with a total variance of 57.62% and is identified with mining and shipping activities. These are the major contamination contributors in the Straits. Land-based pollution originating from vehicular emission with a total variance of 59.43% is attributed to the high level of Pb concentration in the southern region.

The assessment is done in two ways: First, the existing in-situ observing platforms contributing to GOOS (floats, surface drifters, moorings, research/commercial ships) are characterized in terms of their current capabilities in sampling key physical and bio-geochemical oceanic processes. Next the gliders’ capabilities are evaluated in the context of key applications. This includes an evaluation of 140 references presented in the peer-reviewed literature. It is found that GOOS has adequate coverage of sampling in the open ocean for several physical processes. There is a lack of data in the present GOOS in the transition regions between the open ocean and shelf seas. However, most of the documented scientific glider applications operate in this region, suggesting that a sustained glider component in the GOOS could fill that gap. Glider data are included for routine product generation (e.g. alerts, maps). Other noteworthy process-oriented applications where gliders are important survey tools include local sampling of the (sub)mesoscale, sampling in shallow coastal areas, measurements in hazardous environments, and operational monitoring. In most cases, the glider studies address investigations and monitoring of processes across multiple disciplines, making use of the ease to implement a wide range of sensors to gliders. The maturity of glider operations, the wide range of applications that map onto growing GOOS regional needs, and the maturity of glider data flow all justify the formal implementation of gliders into the GOOS. Remaining challenges include the execution of coordinated multinational missions in a sustained mode as well as considering capacity-building aspects in glider operations as well as glider data use.","","article","","17","","","Potential for an underwater glider component as part of the Global Ocean Observing System","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211122016300056","2211-1220","2016","50-82","Methods in Oceanography"

The type of disasters includes flood, earthquake, storm, fire hazard/wildfire, and others. We identify some important patterns from this review. The findings establish the following: (i) ANNs are popularly used to predict and manage floods, (ii) Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) are the commonly used architecture, and (iii) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are most promising for extracting social media information during emergencies.

This results in a crucial reduction of numerical operations required for the solution of the equation of motion by time integration.

Here, we use a 14 kyr sedimentary charcoal and pollen record from Lake Osborne, Tasmania, Australia, to explore how this relationship changes under varying climatic regimes within a temperate rainforest ecosystem. Superposed epoch analysis reveals a significant relationship between fire and vegetation change throughout the Holocene at our site. Our data indicates an initial resilience of the rainforest system to fire under a stable cool and humid climate regime between ca. 12–6 ka. In contrast, fires that occurred after 6 ka, under an increasingly variable climate regime wrought by the onset of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), resulted in a series of changes within the local rainforest vegetation that culminated in the replacement of rainforest by fire-promoted Eucalypt forest. We suggest that an increasingly variable ENSO-influenced climate regime inhibited rainforest recovery from fire because of slower growth, reduced fecundity and increased fire frequency, thus contributing to the eventual collapse of the rainforest system.","","article","","182","","","The changing role of fire in conifer-dominated temperate rainforest through the last 14,000 years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379117307734","0277-3791","2018","37-47","Quaternary Science Reviews"

This has been facilitated by the widespread deployment of large samples of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating (TCND) allowing more sophisticated probability analyses for reducing the statistical uncertainty of moraine ages, and testing of correlations at local, regional and hemispheric scales. Geochronological advances in the field, laboratory and on model calibration have taken place in parallel with modelling of palaeoclimate based on glacier reconstructions, and of glacier sensitivity to temperature and precipitation forcing. In spite of these advances, basic conceptual issues remain. This review questions whether the technical leap forward in dating has encouraged us to over-reach our interpretive limits, particularly in terms of the concept and practice of correlation. We propose that to enable reliable correlation, glacier chronologies should first be examined for their climatic integrity, spatial coherence, and chronological robustness. Even with excellent dating, interpretive complexity remains due to complex climate signals and glacier response characteristics, and to erosion censoring of the landform record. All are issues which must be addressed to avoid either spurious “lumping” (correlation) or “splitting” (differentiation) of glacier chronologies, and thus misinterpretation of the climatic significance of reconstructed glacier advances. We suggest that the reliability of correlation is no better than the weakest link in the chain of reasoning which connects climatic fluctuations with dated landforms and sediments. Improved dating means that poor chronological resolution is less likely to be the limiting factor for correlation, but shifts the focus onto other less quantifiable sources of uncertainty. These conceptual statements are exemplified with reference to Holocene glacial chronologies of contrasting mid-latitude environments in southern Norway, Iceland and New Zealand.","","article","","46","","","Correlation of Late Quaternary moraines: impact of climate variability, glacier response, and chronological resolution","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379112001436","0277-3791","2012","1-29","Quaternary Science Reviews"

In dealing with, the inhomogeneity in the precipitation series, RHtestsV4 software package is used to detect, and adjust for, multiple change points (shifts) that could exist in data series. Finally, the cumulative deviation test was applied at 5% significant level to check the homogeneity (presence of historic changes by cumulative deviations test). Afterward, non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Theil-Sen estimator (TSE) was applied to detect of nature and slope of trends; and, Sequential Mann Kendall (SQMK) test was applied for detection of turning point and magnitude of change in trends. Prior to the application of statistical tests, the pre-whitening technique was used to eliminate the effect of autocorrelation in precipitation data series. Four indices- precipitation concentration index (PCI), precipitation concentration degree (PCD), precipitation concentration period (PCP) and fulcrum (centre of gravity) were used to detect precipitation concentration and the spatial pattern in it. The application of the above-mentioned procedures has shown very notable statewide monotonic trend for monsoon precipitation time series. Regional cluster analysis by SQMK found increasing precipitation in mountain and coastal regions in general, except during the non- monsoon seasons. The results show that higher PCI values were mainly observed in South Bengal, whereas lower PCI values were mostly detected in North Bengal. The PCI values are noticeably larger in places where both monsoon total precipitation and span of rainy season are lower. The results of PCP reveal that precipitation in Gangetic Bengal mostly occurs in summer (monsoon season), and the rainy season arrives earlier in North Bengal than South Bengal, whereas the results of PCD also indicate that the precipitation in North Bengal was more dispersed within a year than that in South Bengal. The concentration characteristic of precipitation could be detected by fulcrum analysis, and significant concentration over most of West Bengal was obvious within July month band. Precipitation trend observed in West Bengal is compared with that in Central India (CI) region and comparison of precipitation departure with Indian monsoon and Gangetic Bengal can be explained by forecasting ensemble.","","article","","182","","","Monotonic trends in spatio-temporal distribution and concentration of monsoon precipitation (1901–2002), West Bengal, India","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809516301880","0169-8095","2016","54-75","Atmospheric Research"

The ENM was built combining knowledge on biological traits of hake recruits (e.g. growth, settlement, mobility and feeding strategy) with patterns of selected ecological variables (chlorophyll-a fronts and concentration, bottom depth, sea bottom current and temperature) to highlight favourable nursery habitats. The results show that hake nurseries require stable bottom temperature (11.8–15.0°C), low bottom currents (<0.034ms−1) and a frequent occurrence of productive fronts in low chlorophyll-a areas (0.1–0.9mgm−3) to support a successful recruitment. These conditions mostly occur recurrently in outer shelf and shelf break areas. The prediction explains the relative balance between biotic and abiotic drivers of hake recruitment in the Mediterranean Sea and the primary role of unfavourable environmental conditions on low recruitment in specific years (i.e. 2011). The ENM outputs particularly agree spatially with biomass data of recruits, although processes such as fishing and natural mortality are not accounted for.

In the Western Mediterranean, where human societies colonized and occupied the coastal areas since the Ancient times, the variability of storm activity for the past three millennia was investigated with a multi-proxy sedimentological and geochemical study from a lagoonal sequence. Mappings of the geochemistry and magnetic susceptibility of detrital sources in the watershed of the lagoon and from the coastal barriers were undertaken in order to track the terrestrial or coastal/marine origin of sediments deposited into the lagoon. The multi-proxy analysis shows that coarser material, low magnetic susceptibility, and high strontium content characterize the sedimentological signature of the paleostorm levels identified in the lagoonal sequence. A comparison with North Atlantic and Western Mediterranean paleoclimate proxies shows that the phases of high storm activity occurred during cold periods, suggesting a climatically-controlled mechanism for the occurrence of these storm periods. Besides, an in-phase storm activity pattern is found between the Western Mediterranean and Northern Europe. Spectral analyses performed on the Sr content revealed a new 270-year solar-driven pattern of storm cyclicity.

In this paper, the IoUT is introduced and its main differences with respect to the Internet of Things (IoT) are outlined. Furthermore, the proposed IoUT architecture is described. Important application scenarios that illustrate the interaction of IoUT components have been proposed. Critical challenges have been identified and addressed.","","article","","35","","","An overview of the internet of underwater things","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804512001646","1084-8045","2012","1879-1890","Journal of Network and Computer Applications"

For the first time, two TREs within the same area at different depths were realized: the Guinea Upwelling Tracer Release Experiment (GUTRE) initiated in 2008 in the oxycline at approximately 320m depth, and the Oxygen Supply Tracer Release Experiment (OSTRE) initiated in 2012 in the core of the OMZ at approximately 410m depth. The mean diapycnal diffusivity Dz was found to be insignificantly smaller in the OMZ core with (1.06±0.24)×10−5m2s−1 compared to (1.11±0.22)×10−5m2s−1 90m shallower in the oxycline. Unexpectedly, GUTRE tracer was detected during two of the OSTRE surveys which showed that the estimated diapycnal diffusivity from GUTRE over a time period of seven years was within the uncertainty of the previous estimates over a time period of three years. The results are consistent with the Dz estimates from microstructure measurements and demonstrate that Dz does not vary significantly vertically in the OMZ within the depth range of 200–600m and does not change with time. The presence of a seamount chain in the vicinity of the GUTRE injection region did not cause enhanced Dz compared to the smoother bottom topography of the OSTRE injection region, although the analysis of vertical shear spectra from ship ADCP data showed elevated internal wave energy level in the seamount vicinity. However, the two tracer patches covered increasingly overlapping areas with time and thus spatially integrated increasingly similar fields of local diffusivity, as well as the difference in local stratification counteracted the influence of roughness on Dz. For both experiments no significant vertical displacements of the tracer were observed, thus diapycnal upwelling within the ETNA OMZ is below the uncertainty level of 5myr−1.","","article","","160","","","Diapycnal diffusivity in the core and oxycline of the tropical North Atlantic oxygen minimum zone","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796316300264","0924-7963","2016","54-63","Journal of Marine Systems"

In this study we use rainfall data from a range of sources to examine four rainfall indices for Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide for 1839–2017. We derive the total rainfall, number of raindays, wettest day of the month and the simple daily intensity index for each city over the past 178 years, and find relatively consistent relationships between all indices despite potential data quality issues associated with the historical data. We identify several extreme daily rainfall events in the pre-1900 period in Sydney and Melbourne that warrant further examination as they appear to be more extreme than anything in the modern record. We find a moderate and relatively stable relationship between El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and annual variations of total rainfall and the number of raindays at all three cities over the research period, but no relationship between ENSO and the annual wettest day, in agreement with other studies using shorter time series.","","article","","25","","","Historical extreme rainfall events in southeastern Australia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221209471930009X","2212-0947","2019","100210","Weather and Climate Extremes"

High mountains and high latitudes are experiencing the greatest warming of all regions on Earth and also are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, in part because ecosystems and natural processes in these areas are intimately linked to the cryosphere. Evidence is mounting that warming will further reduce permafrost and snow and ice cover in high mountains, which in turn will destabilize many slopes, alter sediment delivery to streams, and change subalpine and alpine ecosystems. This paper contributes to the continuing discussion of impacts of climate change on mountain environments by comparing and discussing processes and trends in the mountains of western Canada and the European Alps. We highlight the effects of physiography and climate on physical processes occurring in the two regions. Processes of interest include landslides and debris flows induced by glacier debuttressing, alpine permafrost thaw, changes in rainfall regime, formation and sudden drainage of glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes, ice avalanches, glacier surges, and large-scale sediment transfers due to rapid deglacierization. Our analysis points out the value of integrating observations and data from different areas of the world to better understand these processes and their impacts.","","article","","202","","","Relations between climate change and mass movement: Perspectives from the Canadian Cordillera and the European Alps","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818121000849","0921-8181","2021","103499","Global and Planetary Change"

Although these deformations have been studied since the 1960s, significant insights to the rates of DSGSDs have only been gained within the last two decades owing to progress in geochronology, remote sensing and instrumental monitoring. Absolute age and monitoring data indicate that DSGSD movements are observable over long-term (≥102years) and short-term (<102years) intervals. Apart from creep, an episodic deformation also plays a crucial role, especially in regions with earthquakes and heavy rainfall. Our review also supports the notion of DSGSDs as precursors of catastrophic rock slope failures, given that many of the world's largest rock avalanches have occurred in areas with diagnostic DSGSD features, indicating that sudden collapse was preceded by a prolonged stage of slope sagging. Detailed studies on DSGSDs have therefore the potential for better prediction of catastrophic rock slides and rock avalanches. Future research directions include constraining the lifespan of DSGSDs with absolute age dating and precise high-resolution monitoring of spatio-temporal displacement across DSGSD bodies. It is of great importance to include absolute time scales in the numerical models of DSGSDs. Furthermore, combining remote sensing techniques such as Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry with high-resolution LiDAR scanning and near-surface geophysics offers a promising toolkit for collecting very detailed and accurate data on the short-term deformation rates of DSGSDs.","","article","","156","","","Temporal behavior of deep-seated gravitational slope deformations: A review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825216300423","0012-8252","2016","14-38","Earth-Science Reviews"

Aerosols affect the ERB both directly (when radiation interacts with an aerosol particle) and indirectly (when aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei). Quantifying the indirect effect is challenging as it requires accurate aerosol retrievals in the close proximity to clouds, where aerosol retrievals may be biased due to leakages from the cloud mask (CM). The initial focus of the RGP project was on the direct effect using confidently clear scenes. A single channel CM exploiting the SEVIRI temporal sampling was developed at the RMIB for the use in the RGP project. In this study, that single channel mask was evaluated against two multi-channel CMs, one from the Meteorological Products Extraction Facility (MPEF) at the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the other from the Satellite Application Facility for Supporting NoWCasting and Very Short Range Forecasting (SAFNWC), respectively. The NOAA/NESDIS Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) single channel aerosol algorithm was adjusted to SEVIRI spectral bands and consistently applied to the pixels identified as cloud-free. The aerosol products corresponding to the three CMs were compared, and the RMIB CM was found to be sufficiently accurate and conservative, for RGP applications. Comparisons with independent AODs derived from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites show that the RMIB CM-based SEVIRI aerosol product compares well with its MODIS counterpart. However, a small fraction of cloud-contaminated pixels may still remain in the SEVIRI AOD imagery, chiefly within one to two SEVIRI pixels of the cloud boundary, thus limiting its use for indirect forcing studies. Also, the RMIB CM may screen high AOD non-dust aerosol events (e.g., smoke from biomass burning) as cloud. The potential of the new SEVIRI aerosol product is illustrated by generating 9 km-resolution seasonal maps of AODs and ´ÅǺngström Exponents, and by using the GERB radiative flux measurements for a preliminary quick assessment of the direct aerosol forcing.","","article","","112","","","Aerosol retrieval over ocean from SEVIRI for the use in GERB Earth's radiation budget analyses","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425707004749","0034-4257","2008","2455-2468","Remote Sensing of Environment"

The objective of this study is to undertake a time-series analysis of climate change (CC) indicators within the Bay of Biscay, including the Basque coast. We used an integrated and flexible methodology, based on Generalized Additive Mixed Models, to detect trends on 19 indicators (including marine physics, chemistry, atmosphere, hydrology, geomorphology, biodiversity, and commercial species). The results of 87 long-term time series analysed (~512,000 observations), in the last four decades, indicate four groups of climate regime shifts: 1) A gradual shift associated with CC starting in the 1980s, with a warming of the sea surface down to 100 m depth in the bay (0.10-0.25 °C per decade), increase in air temperature and insolation. This warming may have impacted on benthic community redistribution in the Basque coast, favouring warm-water species relative to cold-water species. Weight at age for anchovy and sardine decreased in the last two decades. 2) Deepening of the winter mixed layer depth in the south-eastern bay that probably led to increases in nutrients, surface oxygen, and chlorophyll concentration. Current increases on chlorophyll and zooplankton (i.e., copepods) biomass are contrary to those expected under CC scenarios in the region. 3) Sea-level rise (1.5-3.5 cm per decade since 1990s), associated with CC. 4) Increase of extreme wave height events of 16.8 cm per decade in the south-eastern bay, probably related to stormy conditions in the last decade, with impacts on beach erosion. Estimating accurate rates of sea warming, sea-level rise, extreme events, and foreseeing the future pathways of marine productivity, are key to define the best adaptation measures to minimize negative CC impacts in the region.","","article","","803","","","Climate regime shifts and biodiversity redistribution in the Bay of Biscay","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721046970","0048-9697","2022","149622","Science of The Total Environment"

This study addresses these issues with nearly 15 years of relatively high-resolution satellite altimetry measurements. We first compare two distinct automated methods for eddy identification. The objective validation protocol shows that the rarely-used geometrical or “winding-angle method”, based on the curvature of the streamline functions, is more accurate than the commonly-used “Okubo–Weiss algorithm”, which defines a vortex as a simple connected region with values of Okubo–Weiss parameter weaker than a given threshold. We then investigate vortices off Peru using more than 20,000 mesoscale eddies identified by the winding-angle method. Coherent eddies, characterized by a high ratio of vorticity to deformation rate, are typically formed along the coast and propagate westward at 3–6cms−1. The vortices have a mean radius of 80km, increasing northward, and are most frequently observed off of Chimbote (9°S) and south of San Juan (15°S). The mean eddy lifetime is about 1 month, but if eddies survive at least 2 months, the probability for surviving an additional week (or month) is constant at 90% (or 67%). Anticyclonic eddies tend to propagate northwestward whereas cyclonic vortices migrate southwestward. In general, cyclones and anticyclones are similar, except for eddies surviving at least 6 months. In this case, after a similar 3–4 months of radius and amplitude growth, amplitudes (or sizes) decay particularly rapidly for anticyclonic (or cyclonic) eddies. In terms of intensity, cyclonic eddies show a rapid decay during the first 3 months before arriving at a quasi-constant value, whereas anticyclones exhibit steady decline. Finally, eddy temporal variations were examined at seasonal and interannual scales in the “coastal” region favorable to the formation of energetic mesoscale structures. On seasonal scales, eddy activity is maximal in fall and minimum in spring. At interannual scales, the eddy activity index was maximal during the strong El Niño of 1997–1998 but another strong maximum of eddy activity also occurred late in 2004. These temporal variations are probably associated with the intensification of the upwelling thermal front and with the passage of coastal-trapped waves which generate baroclinic instabilities. Further investigation of the mechanisms involved on the eddy genesis is needed.","","article","","79","","","Mesoscale eddies off Peru in altimeter records: Identification algorithms and eddy spatio-temporal patterns","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661108001663","0079-6611","2008","106-119","Progress in Oceanography"

Atmospheric pollen concentrations in the Region of Murcia Aerobiological Network (Spain) were studied in relation to the occurrence of earthquakes of moment magnitude (up to Mw = 5.1) and intensity (intensity up to grade VII on the European Macroseismic Scale). In this study, a decade (2010–2019) was considered across the cities of the network. Earthquakes were detected in 12 out of 1535 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Cartagena, 49 out of 1481 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Lorca, and 39 out of 1441 days in the Olea Main Pollen Season in Murcia. The Olea pollen grains in this network were attributed to the species Olea europaea, i.e., the olive tree, a taxon that appears widely in the Mediterranean basin, in both cultivated and wild subspecies. Differences between the Olea concentration on days with and without earthquakes were only found in Lorca (Kruskal-Wallis: p-value = 0.026). The low frequency and intensity of the earthquakes explained these results. The most catastrophic earthquake felt in Lorca on May 11th, 2011 (IVII, Mw = 5.1, 9 casualties) did not result in clear variations in pollen concentrations, while meteorology (e.g., African Dust Outbreak) might have conditioned these pollen concentrations.

A primary purpose of this paper is to independently verify this succession through whole-rock and Cerion aminostratigraphies and AMS 14C-based age models. Over 150 individual Cerion shells were age-ranked from 140 ka to modern using stratigraphic position and reverse-phase HPLC (RPC) amino acid racemization, which was sufficiently sensitive to resolve stratigraphic subunits within the Holocene and late Pleistocene. A secondary purpose of this paper is to assess broad changes in the gross morphology (height, width) of supersets of Cerion from age-ranked lots spanning this ~140 kyr chronostratigraphy. Through each of the three interglacial sequences (i.e., marine isotope stages 5e, 5a, and 1), between-sample trends in mean gross morphology often greatly exceed within-sample variances (±1σ). Live-collected Cerion exhibit a range in gross morphology that nearly encompasses that of the entire fossil sequence. A trend of increasing gross shell size characterizes each of the interglacial phases, with a major step-decrease between marine isotope stages 5a and 1. While between-unit variation is often great in Cerion from SSI, within-unit variation appears unimodal through the record.","","article","","267","","","Integrated Late Quaternary chronostratigraphy for San Salvador Island, Bahamas: Patterns and trends of morphological change in the land snail Cerion","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018208003465","0031-0182","2008","41-58","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

Most of these processes have different flow regimes with varying distributions of the different materials/phases, flowing at different speeds and spread over the cross-section of the conduit supporting the flow, an important topic in CFD studies and software development. These processes are monitored with a plethora of sensors, continuously gathering vast amount of valuable data from various locations with many control loops distributed in the processes with a dedicated overall process control using different strategies, which recently have AI and machine learning techniques in their portfolio. The data from the sensors are valuable in data fusion not only for deterministic mechanistic modeling but also for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a growing branch of AI-based industrial machine learning. Data from process tomography/tomometry using nonintrusive and noninvasive sensing provide big data in real time, useful in identifying various flow phenomena, such as flow regimes, tunneling flow in silos, infiltration of sand in pipes, unusually high presence of gas bubbles in cooling water, etc. In this chapter, some applications of ECT and EIT in the above three process industries are presented. This chapter focuses on the sensor arrays and protocols used along with excitation and sensing methods used in the ECT/EIT modules and then presents some results from EDA as applied in the growing field of industrial machine learning. In all the three branches of process industries mentioned above, interesting results are presented showing possibilities of flow regime identification based on the distribution of the phases involved with the possibilities of integrating ECT/EIT in model free adaptive control of these processes.","","incollection","Woodhead Publishing","","Industrial Tomography (Second Edition)","978-0-12-823015-2","26 - Applications of AI and possibilities for process control","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128230152000145","","2022","823-852",""

The Fire Tower Zone (W-Mo-Bi) and the North Zone (Sn-Zn-In) comprise the main mineralized zones within the Mount Pleasant deposit. The rock units examined at surface in both zones are highly altered and are surface weathered to some extent. In order to classify these rock units with confidence, the Olympus X-5000 portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer was used in this study to rapidly obtain the geochemical composition of these rocks, identify lithologic discriminants, and find alteration/mineralization indicators in these areas. The immobile elements Ti, Zr, Nb, Y, and Th were selected to discriminate among various rock types. The Little Mount Pleasant Formation has the highest Ti and Zr and the Mount Pleasant Granitic Suite (MPGS, GI and GII) contains the highest Y, Nb, and Th. The McDougall Brook Granitic Suite (MBGS) has an intermediate composition between them. The element ratios of Zr/Ti, Nb/Ti, Y/Ti, and Th/Ti effectively discriminate these rock units and increase from the Little Mount Pleasant Formation, to the MBGS, and then to the MPGS. Greisen and propylitic alteration are reflected by strong depletion of K and Rb in some samples. The Fe and Mn typically are leached out of the mineralization system during the greisen alteration. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the pXRF datasets. The first principal component (PC1) of the pXRF data from both the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone mainly extracts information on Ti, Zr, Ce, Cr, V, Nb, Y, U, and Th, and thus represents different rock units. The PC2 is characterized by high-positive loadings of K, Rb, Fe, and Mn and negative loading of As and Mo. It is interpreted as the W-Mo mineralization indicator showing by the enrichment in Mo and depletion of K, Rb, Fe, and Mn associated with quartz+topaz+sericite+fluorite alteration. The PC3 consists of positive loadings of Sn, Zn, Cu, and S and slightly negative loadings of Sr and Ba, and thus represents the Sn-Zn mineralization in this area.","","article","","177","","","Petrogeochemical assessment of rock units and identification of alteration/mineralization indicators using portable X-ray fluorescence measurements: Applications to the Fire Tower Zone (W-Mo-Bi) and the North Zone (Sn-Zn-In), Mount Pleasant deposit, New Brunswick, Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375674217301498","0375-6742","2017","61-72","Journal of Geochemical Exploration"

The presence of both fresh Atlantic water and more saline Mediterranean water gives the basin an intense inflow/outflow regime and complex circulation patterns. Energetic mesoscale structures that evolve from meanders of the Algerian Current into isolated cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies dominate the area, with marked repercussions on biological activity. Despite its remarkable importance, this region and its variability are still poorly known and basin-wide knowledge of its meso- and submesoscale features is still incomplete. Studying such complex processes requires a synergistic approach that involves integrated observing systems. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of combined use of autonomous underwater vehicles, such as gliders, with a new generation of satellite altimetry. In this context, we present results of an observational program conducted in the Algerian Basin during fall 2014 and 2015 that aimed to advance our knowledge of its main features. The study was carried out through analysis of high resolution glider observations, collected along the Algerian BAsin Circulation Unmanned Survey (ABACUS) chokepoint, in synergy with co-located SARAL/AltiKa altimetric products and CMEMS numerical simulations. Results show that glider-derived dynamic height and SARAL/AltiKa absolute dynamic topography have similar patterns, with RMS of the differences ranging between 1.11 and 2.90 cm. Even though larger discrepancies are observed near the Balearic and Algerian coasts, correlation coefficients between glider and satellite observations seem mostly to be affected by reduced synopticity between the measurements. Glider observations acquired during the four surveys reveal the presence of several water masses of Atlantic and Mediterranean origin (i.e., AW and LIW at different modification levels) with marked seasonal variability.","","article","","179","","","Monitoring the Algerian Basin through glider observations, satellite altimetry and numerical simulations along a SARAL/AltiKa track","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796317302658","0924-7963","2018","55-71","Journal of Marine Systems"

Results show that the temperature gradient between the Korean and Japan margins was relatively small (~2°C) during the warm interval of the interglacial period (MIS 5e). But it was large (~10°C) during the transitional period from the interglacial to the glacial (MIS 5a and b). The temperature of the Korean margin was colder than that of the Japan margin during the transitional period. Based on the reconstructed alkenone temperature, temporal changes in surface circulation and subpolar front (SPF) have been investigated. During the interglacial period when sea level was higher than today (MIS 5e), the influx of the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) was enhanced and the both Korean and Japan margins were influenced by the warm water. At that time, the SPF appears to be located in the northern part compared to today. During the transitional period when the sea level was lower than today (MIS 5a and b), the TWC volume transport was reduced contributing to the lower SST. Its effect on the surface temperature appears to be larger along the Korean margin than the Japan margin, indicating that the strength of the East Korea Warm Current appears to be strongly correlated with the TWC volume transport. The SPF would displace southward orienting from southwest to northeast at that time. During the glacial period when the sea level was very lower (~100m deep), the influx of warm water was almost completely restricted and the cold water expanded into the southern area. The SPF would disappear at that time. Model simulation results also support the relationship between the TWC volume transport and surface circulation and the SST.","","article","","313-314","","","Spatial and temporal changes in sea surface temperature, circulation and subpolar front of the East Sea (Japan Sea) during the last 130,000years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018211005311","0031-0182","2012","225-233","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

Additional mechanisms, such as interactions between atmospheric circulation, ice-sheet dynamics, and the influence of solar irradiance, also have been proposed to explain abrupt climatic events, but evidence remains elusive. This study presents evidence from multi-proxy analyses on the Holocene sediments of Eleanor Lake, interior British Columbia. Climatic inferences from our decadal-resolution record of biogenic silica (BSi) abundance are supported by changes in diatom and pollen assemblages from the same core and correlations with existing regional climate records. The BSi record reveals abrupt and persistent climatic shifts at 10.2, 9.3, and 8.5ka, the latter two of which are coeval with major collapses of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The record also reveals a short-term cooling at 8.2ka that is distinct from the 8.5ka event and similar in magnitude to several other late-Holocene coolings. BSi is correlated with solar-irradiance indices (r=0.43–0.61), but the correlation is opposite in sign to that expected from direct solar forcing and weakens after 8ka. Possible mechanisms causing the abrupt and persistent climate changes of the early Holocene include 1) sudden losses of ice and proglacial lake extent, causing a shift in the meridional structure of atmospheric circulation, 2) a possible link between solar minima and El Niño-like conditions that are correlated with warm spring temperature in interior British Columbia, and 3) the influence of solar irradiance variability on the position of the polar jet, possibly via effects on the strength of the glacial anticyclone.","","article","","30","","","Abrupt Holocene climate change and potential response to solar forcing in western Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379111000758","0277-3791","2011","1243-1255","Quaternary Science Reviews"

These 19 years of measurements are particularly significant for the 7Be analysis as they cover the complete 24th solar cycle, 2008–2018. A Time Series Decomposition (TSD) technique has been applied to determine the different components present in the dataset: the trend, seasonal and irregular components. Then, the atmospheric parameters (Precipitation (Pp), Relative Humidity (RH), Temperature (Temp), Wind speed (WS), Total Cloudiness (TC), Low Cloudiness (LC)), teleconnection indices and the solar activity (Sun Spot Number, SSN) were used to justify the variability of each component. SSN and the teleconnection indices (Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO)) are found to have a major impact on the trend component of 7Be. In turn, all the atmospheric parameters were found to have strong impact on the seasonal component. In order to observe the change in the impact of the parameters from the 24th solar cycle (from 2008 to 2018) to the complete time series (starting in 2000), the comparison between the two periods has been carried out. The results show that, over the 24th solar cycle, the SSN impacted predominantly on the trend component, whereas atmospheric parameters showed a slightly higher impact on the seasonal component. In addition, some atmospheric factors (Temp, RH, Pp, TC, LC) appeared to partially affect the irregular component. The analysis of the two phases of the 24th solar cycle shows that the influence of SSN is higher during the descending phase than during the ascending one. This behaviour is opposed to the one found for the 23rd solar cycle, which clarifies the special characteristics of the 24th cycle. Besides that, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis was applied in order to extract the possible periodicities characterising 7Be data. The analysis revealed three sets of periodicities. Then, the Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) method was particularly useful to study coherences between 7Be data and teleconnection indices. The 7Be concentrations in the large period (11–14 years) detected by CWT was found to be mainly modulated by WeMO, AMO and QBO, while the NAO modulates the smaller periods.","","article","","213","","","Sources of the seasonal-trend behaviour and periodicity modulation of 7Be air concentration in the atmospheric surface layer observed in southeastern Spain","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231019303942","1352-2310","2019","148-158","Atmospheric Environment"

Despite these measurements being fundamental to understanding the mechanisms and flow paths that deliver these constituents to river networks, there is a paucity of such data for headwater agricultural catchments. The aim of this paper is to deduce the dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to an upland river network in the UK through characterisation of the temporal variability of hydrological fluxes, and associated soluble and particulate concentrations for the period spanning March 2012–February 2013. An assessment of the factors producing constituent hysteresis is undertaken following factor analysis (FA) on a suite of measured environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider catchment conditions prior to, and during catchment-wide hydrological events. Analysis indicates that suspended sediment is delivered to the fluvial system predominantly via rapidly responding pathways driven by event hydrology. However, evidence of complex, figure-of-eight hysteresis is observed following periods of hydrological quiescence, highlighting the importance of preparatory processes. Sediment delivery via a slow moving, probably sub-surface pathway does occur, albeit infrequently and during low magnitude events at the catchment outlet. Phosphorus is revealed to have a distinct hysteretic response to that of suspended sediment, with sub-surface pathways dominating. However, high magnitude events were observed to exhibit threshold-like behaviour, whereby activation and connection of usually disconnected depositional zones to the fluvial networks results in the movement of vast phosphorus fluxes. Multiple pathways are observed for particulate and soluble constituents, highlighting the challenges faced in mitigating the delivery of contaminant fluxes to headwater river systems.","","article","","523","","","Dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to fluvial networks draining grassland dominated headwater catchments","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715002739","0048-9697","2015","178-190","Science of The Total Environment"

Visual ambiguities caused by variations in view angle, lighting, and occlusions make the re-identification problem extremely challenging. To overcome the ambiguities, most previous approaches often extract robust feature representations or learn a sophisticated feature transformation. However, most of these approaches ignore the effect of the impostors arising from annotation or tracking process. In this case, impostors are regarded as genuine and applied in training process, leading to the model drift problem. In order to reduce the risk of model drifting, we propose to automatically discover impostors in a multiple instance metric learning framework. Specifically, we propose a kNN based confidence score to evaluate how much an impostor invades the interested target and utilize it as a prior in the framework. In the meanwhile, we integrate an impostor rejection mechanism in the multiple instance metric learning framework to automatically discover impostors, and learn the semantical similarity metrics with the refined training set. Experiments show that the proposed system performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms on two challenging datasets (iLIDS-VID and PRID 2011).

This exposes ICSs to modern advanced cyber threats. Existing security solutions try to prevent, detect, and react to cyber threats by employing security measures that typically do not cross the organization's boundaries. However, novel targeted multi-stage attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) take advantage of the interdependency between organizations. By exploiting vulnerabilities of various systems, APT campaigns intrude several organizations using them as stepping stones to reach the target infrastructure. A coordinated effort to timely reveal such attacks, and promptly deploy mitigation measures is therefore required. Organizations need to cooperatively exchange security-relevant information to obtain a broader knowledge on the current cyber threat landscape and subsequently obtain new insight into their infrastructures and timely react if necessary. Cyber security operation centers (SOCs), as proposed by the European NIS directive, are being established worldwide to achieve this goal. CI providers are asked to report to the responsible SOCs about security issues revealed in their networks. National SOCs correlate all the gathered data, analyze it and eventually provide support and mitigation strategies to the affiliated organizations. Although many of these tasks can be automated, human involvement is still necessary to enable SOCs to adequately take decisions on occurring incidents and quickly implement counteractions. In this paper we present a collaborative approach to cyber incident information management for gaining situational awareness on interconnected European CIs.

Over the past 60 years (1951–2010), the trends of temperature and precipitation in the two regions are broadly similar in their seasonality. However, atmospheric advection influences the two regions differently during winter. The differential advective effects are much weaker in the other seasons. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation is the strongest correlator with interannual variability in the two regions, followed by the Arctic Oscillation and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Projected changes by the late 21st Century are qualitatively similar to the changes that have been ongoing over the past 60 years, although the rate of change increases modestly under mid-range forcing scenarios (e.g., the A1B scenario). The greatest warming is projected to occur farther north over the Arctic Ocean in response to sea ice loss. Precipitation is projected to increase by all models, although increases in evapotranspiration preclude conclusions about trends toward wetter or drier land surface conditions.

The difficulties associated with the detection of extreme events found at these scales motivates the research of methodologies that efficiently sample relevant uncertainties. This study investigates the potential of multiple techniques to account for model uncertainty. The performance of various stochastic schemes is assessed for an exceptional heavy precipitation episode which occurred in eastern Spain. In particular, the stochastic strategies are compared to a multiphysics approach in terms of both spread and skill. The analyzed techniques include stochastic parameterization perturbation tendency and perturbations to influential parameters within the microphysics scheme. The introduction of stochastic perturbations to the microphysics processes results in a larger ensemble spread throughout the entire simulation. Conversely, modifications to microphysics parameters generate small-scale perturbations that rapidly grow over areas with high convective instability, in contrast to the other methods, which produce more widespread perturbations.

Although the consequences may be severe, our worse-case scenario does not include the complete failure of the entire 937 operating satellites in the current population, which have a replacement value of ∼$170–230 billion, and supporting a ∼$90 billion/year industry. Our estimates suggest a potential economic loss of <$70 billion for lost revenue (∼$44 billion) and satellite replacement for GEO satellites (∼$24 billion) caused by a ‘once a century’ single storm similar to the 1859 superstorm. We estimate that 80 satellites (LEO, MEO, and GEO) may be disabled as a consequence of a superstorm event. Additional impacts may include the failure of many of the GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems in MEO. Approximately 97 LEO satellites, which normally would not have re-entered for many decades, may prematurely de-orbit by ca 2021 as a result of the temporarily increased atmospheric drag caused by a superstorm event occurring in ca. 2012. The $100 billion International Space Station may lose significant altitude, placing it in critical need for re-boosting by an amount potentially outside the range of typical Space Shuttle operations, which are in any case scheduled to end in 2010. Currently, the ability to forecast extreme particle events and coronal mass ejections, or predict their fluences and geoseverity in the 24-h prior to the event, appears to be no better than 50/50. Our analysis of economic impacts is a first attempt at estimation whose approach will suggest ways in which better estimates may eventually be obtained.","","article","","38","","","Forecasting the impact of an 1859-calibre superstorm on satellite resources","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117705012457","0273-1177","2006","280-297","Advances in Space Research"

In the early days, geochemical prospecting methods were mainly used for exploration of ore and non-metal deposits in Germany. Mapping for the first geochemical atlas of Germany was conducted in the 1980s by the Federal Institute of Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) with a sample density of one sample per 3km2. Parts of eastern Germany (Flechtingen Ridge, Harz Mountains, Thuringian Forest, Slate Mountains, Ore Mountains, Granulite Mountains, the Lausitz region, and along the Elbe River) were mapped by the former Central Geological Institute Berlin (ZGI) during the same period at a density of 1.3 samples per km2. Stream sediment and surface water were sampled in all of these high-density geochemical mapping projects. The first low sample density geochemical survey (one site per 380km2) was carried out for the latest geochemical atlas of Germany, which presents comprehensive information about the regional distribution of hazardous inorganic and organic substances. A density of one sample per 5000km2 was also used in Germany for the FOREGS Geochemical Mapping Project of Europe. Geochemical stream sediment and surface water data obtained at these three different scales in different geochemical mapping projects have been compared in this study for the elements Ba, Cu, Cr, Pb and U in stream sediment as well as pH, EC and U in stream water. Comparison of overlapping high and low sample density surveys conducted in the same study areas, demonstrates that the geochemical patterns produced from low sample density surveys are very nearly the same as those from the high sample density surveys, and that they can be related to natural processes. The low sample density geochemical surveys in Germany provide element background values very similar to those obtained by high sample density mapping of the same region. In unmapped terrain, low-density geochemical mapping provides a cost-effective reconnaissance technique to establish element background values.","","article","","154","","","How robust are geochemical patterns?

There has been a concerted effort to understand the sources of predictability at subseasonal time-scales, and this effort has continued to make progress in recent years. Besides the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), other modes of variability affect TCs at these time-scales, in particular various equatorial waves. Additionally, TC activity is also modulated by extratropical processes via Rossby wave breaking. There has also been progress in the ability of models to simulate the MJO and its modulation of TC activity. Community efforts have created multi-model ensemble datasets, which have made it possible to evaluate the forecast skill of the MJO and TCs on subseasonal time-scales in multiple forecasting systems. While there is positive skill in some cases, there is strong dependence on the ensemble system considered, the basin examined, and whether the storms have extratropical influences or not. Furthermore, the definition of skill differs among studies. Forecasting centers are currently issuing subseasonal TC forecasts using various techniques (statistical, statistical-dynamical and dynamical). There is also a strong interest in the private sector for forecasts with 3-4 weeks lead time.","","article","","8","","","Tropical Cyclone Prediction on Subseasonal Time-Scales","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225603219300712","2225-6032","2019","150-165","Tropical Cyclone Research and Review"

We study the transport of this pollution, analyzing the physical oceanographic conditions during and after the dumping. We find that a cyclonic gyre was present between the dumping site and the coast, visible in satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature data. Using Lagrangian simulations, we confirm that near-surface currents could have brought part of the pollution to the coast, and fueled the bloom. This scenario explains also the anomalous later finding of ammonium near Chiloé.

The present study aims to identify submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) locations and quantify the contaminant load reaching to the western coast of India (Gujarat coast) using stable isotopes, seepage meter, heat and solute transport model. The coastal aquifers are highly enriched in trace metals due to various active natural processes and anthropogenic activities across the coast. Terrestrial and recirculated SGD was a significant contributor to flow and metal load, which ranged from 1.04 to 181.1 m3.year−1 and 0–77.41 kg.year-1, respectively. The highest estimated SGD in the Gujarat coast was relatively less than the SGD reported in the Bay of Bengal and comparable to the South Chennai coast. The order of metal flux found in the study was Zn > Fe > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cu > Mn, whereas the highest flux of Zn (77.41 kg. year−1) was reported at Fansa beach, which was 7x Fe-flux and 45 x Cr-flux, respectively.

Negative Δ199Hg values and slightly positive Δ200Hg values were observed in both PM2.5 and PM10. PBM input sources were identified with isotopic compositions and meteorological data using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. It revealed that biomass combustion is the main source of particulate mercury in SCXB, and the two other sources are urban anthropogenic emissions and potential marine sources. Seasonal variations in isotopic composition and correlation analysis suggested that PBM in SCXB mainly originate from inland after long-distance transportation in spring and under the influence of oceanic air masses in summer. The Δ199Hg/Δ201Hg ratios in all samples (1.01 ± 0.05, 2SE) indicated that the photoreduction of Hg(II) in the aerosol was the main reaction process of PBM transformation in the atmosphere.

To help realize these resources, India carried out two dedicated research expeditions (NGHP-01 and 02) to identify, characterize and analyze natural gas hydrate resource potential in its maritime boundaries. This work presents a review of the current status of research and development activities in the area of natural gas hydrate systems in India taking a cue from the NGHP-02 research findings. The NGHP-02 is considered one of the most extensive research programs to date for drilling and pressure core collection. This program resulted in minimally disturbed and well-preserved core samples collected from pressure-coring. Logging while drilling, wireline logging, formation pressure testing, vertical seismic profiling, and pressure core analysis confirmed one of the highly saturated (~40%–100%), sand-based, hydrate accumulation in three ultradeep locations, Area B, C, and E, eastern offshore India. The shipborne evaluation helped in the collection of the most suitable core samples to perform the first-ever comprehensive post-cruise triaxial testing, to obtain key petrophysical and geomechanical properties of interest. Further, a suitably designed experimental strategy helped to collect multiple sets of data from utilizing a lesser number of pressure core samples. The most prominent experiments included drained-undrained consolidation and compression, multistage compression and consolidation, alternating strain-rate compression, and permeability evaluation tests. The seal overlying hydrate layer are primarily made of clay rich sediments. The permeability measurements findings of the tested samples were reported in the range of 0.01 to tens of mD depending upon hydrate saturation, sand particle distribution, and range of applied effective stress. Significant permeability loss (∼90%) with increasing effective stress (up to 10 MPa) was noted. Further, permeability anisotropy, a ratio of horizontal to vertical permeability = 4, is reported to be consistent with the values reported for other marine hydrate-bearing sediments. The geochemical analysis put the natural gas to be primarily composed of methane mostly from microbial sources however part contribution from deeper sources was not ruled out. Moreover, numerical modeling of sand migration, thermal characterization, hydrate morphology, and extensive reservoir simulations was also used to obtain greater insight into the nature of the hydrate deposition system and its resource potential. Hydrate occurrences in an ultradeep and shallow subseafloor environment, such as those found in the Krishna-Godavari basin, pose challenge to well bore stability and sustained gas production due to the combined effect of high-pressure drawdown and hydrate dissociation induced strength loss and sand migration. Hence, incorporation of a coupled flow, geomechanical and sand migration analysis in well bore stability and reservoir simulation are suggested as a way forward. The NGHP-02 program and its findings not only advance India's endeavor to locally produce natural gas from these unconventional resources but also provides valuable information concerning exploitation of other marine gas hydrate accumulations found elsewhere in the world.","","article","","135","","","Prospects and challenges in unlocking natural-gas-hydrate energy in India: Recent advancements","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817221005006","0264-8172","2022","105397","Marine and Petroleum Geology"

The complexity of chemical or aerosol exchange experiments in the Arctic requires considering occasional frontal exchange similar to that of the mid-latitudes, potential local contamination, and local sources of heat and moisture. These concerns are eliminated through site selection in most Antarctic exchange experiments. The inherent stability of near-surface layers in the arctic tropopause causes temporal anomalies when arrival times of aerosol or gaseous contaminants are compared with conservative meteorological tracers, further complicating the analysis. Three cases are presented. One illustrates the complexity in analyzing aerosol related to a warming event, the second describes the dimensions of a deep tropospheric mixing in the Arctic Basin, and the third examines the diurnal exchange of aerosol in the arctic summer. Some criteria relative to temporal resolution of aerosol and chemical measurements with respect to meteorological processes are proposed.

It is also shown by the foraminiferal evidence for shifts in the polar front in the North Atlantic. Recent pollen and lithostratigraphic investigations in the Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada and in the till plains of west-central Ohio on opposite sides of the late-glacial spruce forest indicate that the event also left a record in eastern North America. Experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model, with the temperature of North Atlantic surface waters depressed to full-glacial levels, lowered summer temperatures in ‘upwind’ periglacial eastern North America by 2°C — just as far inland as they did downwind in western Europe, where the paleoecological record of cooling is clear. A leading hypothesis for the cause for the Younger Dryas cooling appeals to the influx of tabular icebergs released from arctic ice shelves around the wasting Scandinavian and Siberian ice sheets during the Alleröd warming. The resulting cooling of the North Atlantic waters during the Younger Dryas could be facilitated or precipitated by the abrupt influx of glacial meltwater derived from almost the entire southern margin of the Laurentide ice sheet and emerging from the Gulf of St Lawrence, as brought about by a major shift in drainage direction from the Mississippi River to the St Lawrence River about 10.8 ka BP. A supplemental influx of fresh water may have come from the contemporaneous drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake. The diversion of Laurentide meltwater to the Atlantic was caused by retreat of an ice lobe in northwestern Ontario north of Minnesota, allowing the huge Glacial Lake Agassiz in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to drain into the Great Lakes and more than double the inflow of meltwaters in the North Atlantic, thereby diverting the Gulf Stream and permitting the influx of icebergs from the north to cool the ocean surface. Minor readvance of the ice lobe about 10 ka BP temporarily diverted the Lake Agassiz drainage to the south. With the final retreat of the ice, the drainage again went to the east, but by this time the ice sheets were much diminished and the regional climate had warmed enough so that the effects of the meltwater flux on the Gulf Stream were muted, and the ice sheets bordering the North Atlantic had retreated onto the land and no longer delivered enough icebergs to cool the surface waters. The Younger Dryas interval thus was terminated, and the warming manifested in the Alleröd was renewed.","","article","","8","","","The amphi-atlantic distribution of the younger dryas paleoclimatic oscillation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0277379189900334","0277-3791","1989","295-306","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Analyzing the Global Inundation Extent Multi-Satellite (GIEMS) time series, we first show that surface water extent (SWE) exhibits marked seasonal patterns, well distributed along the major rivers and their tributaries, and with two annual maxima located: i) in the lakes region of the Lwalaba sub-basin and ii) in the “Cuvette Centrale”, including Tumba and Mai-Ndombe Lakes. At an interannual time scale, we show that SWE variability is influenced by ENSO and the Indian Ocean dipole events. We then estimate water level maps and surface water storage (SWS) in floodplains, lakes, rivers and wetlands of the CRB, over the period 2003–2007, using a multi-satellite approach, which combines the GIEMS dataset with the water level measurements derived from the ENVISAT altimeter heights. The mean annual variation in SWS in the CRB is 81 ± 24 km3 and contributes to 19 ± 5% of the annual variations of GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (33 ± 7% in the Middle Congo). It represents also ∼6 ± 2% of the annual water volume that flows from the Congo River into the Atlantic Ocean.","","article","","66","","","Satellite-based estimates of surface water dynamics in the Congo River Basin","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030324341730274X","1569-8432","2018","196-209","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation"

A dataset of 12 Sentinel-2 MSI images, in three different study areas along the Irish coast, has been analysed. Before the application of the bathymetric model two atmospheric correction procedures were tested: Deep Water Correction (DWC) and Case 2 Regional Coastal Color (C2RCC) processor. DWC outperformed C2RCC in the majority of the satellite images showing more consistent results. Using DWC for atmospheric correction before the application of the bathymetric model, the lowest average RMSE was found in Dublin Bay (RMSE = 1.60, bias = −0.51), followed by Mulroy Bay (RMSE = 1.66, bias = 1.30) while Brandon Bay showed the highest average error (RMSE = 2.43, bias = 1.86). However, when the optimal imagery selection was considered, depth estimations with a bias less than 0.1 m and a spread of ±1.40 m were achieved up to 10 m. These results were comparable to those achieved by empirical tuning methods, despite not relying on any in situ depth data. This conclusion is of particular relevance as model inversion approaches might allow future modifications in crucial parts of the processing chain leading to improved results. Atmospheric correction, the selection of optimal images (e.g. low turbidity), the definition of suitably limited ranges for the per-pixel occurrence of optical constituents (phytoplankton, CDOM, backscatter) and seabed reflectances, in combination with the understanding of the specifics characteristics at each particular site, were critical steps in the derivation of satellite bathymetry.","","article","","241","","","Satellite-derived bathymetry in optically complex waters using a model inversion approach and Sentinel-2 data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771420302006","0272-7714","2020","106814","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science"

The precipitation shows a variable chemistry linked to the relative supplies of material derived from maritime, pollutant and lithogenic sources. Inputs of solutes are spatially variable for those components associated with pollutant sources indicating local and variable sources for these constituents. Gaseous concentrations of SOx, NOx and NH3 all average ∼ 8 ppb outside the forest: within the forest, lower concentrations were observed. The precipitation — throughfall — stemflow results indicate that the trees capture occult deposition (i.e. non-precipitation detected atmospheric supplies of materials, e.g. from fine-droplets/mist, gases and particulate matter), thereby enriching the composition of stemflow and throughfall. Concentrations and fluxes of most solutes are increased by between 50 and 100%: only strontium, barium and hydrogen ions show a depletion. At the forest edge, there is an even greater difference between the precipitation and net-precipitation, especially for the sea-salts: the trees at the forest edge are particularly efficient at scavenging the occult materials. There are differences in chemical fluxes for the blocks that are not simply confined to an edge-interior division: this is most marked for manganese where cycling through the vegetation is dominant and the various locations respond in different ways. Despite storm damage there is little sign of a change in the chemical fluxes to the catchment: the loss of canopy is probably compensated for by an increased roughness that, in turn, results in increased turbulence, higher interception loss and greater scavenging.","","article","","142","","","Interception of chemicals at a forest edge for a rural low-lying site at Black Wood, Hampshire, Southern England","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969794903212","0048-9697","1994","127-141","Science of The Total Environment"

By exciting the natural frequencies of the ice–structure interaction system, severe vibrations may occur. For a better understanding of how dynamic ice–structure interaction affects the system properties, a stochastic subspace system identification technique, SSI-cov is introduced to identify modal parameters during dynamic ice–structure interactions. Due to the uncertain input variables of SSI-cov, the identified modal parameters suffer from the quantitative judgment of the analyst. To address this problem, this study proposes an uncertainty analysis (UA) framework to obtain estimates of modal parameters. This framework constitutes both a sensitivity analysis (SA) and a UA. First, SA is applied to pick up the input variables that contribute the most to the identified modal parameters. Next, the important variables are left free to vary over their range of existence to obtain the modal parameters’ uncertainties. The framework is applied to full-scale tests from Norströmsgrund lighthouse and model tests carried out in Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA). The comparison with traditional automated modal parameter identification shows its superiority in terms of the accuracy of modal parameters.","","article","","277","","","Towards uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for modal parameters identification during ice–structure interaction","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002980182300608X","0029-8018","2023","114224","Ocean Engineering"

This study catalogues for the first time the climatology, variability and trends of TCs affecting Nuku'alofa, the capital of Tonga using the Southwest Pacific Enhanced Archived for Tropical Cyclone (SPEArTC) dataset for the period between 1970 and 2019. The variability is examined in relation to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which is the major driver of the year-to-year variability of TC activity in the SWP.

Hedeby (54° 29′ 27.77″ N, 9° 33′ 54.42″ E) is located approximately 40 km northwest of Kiel, Northern Germany, at the western shore of the lake Haddebyer Noor. The protected status of the settlement as a UNESCO heritage site predetermined the choice of a minimum-destructive technique of coring. The stratigraphy demonstrated that the main factors of soil destruction were surface erosion, incorporation of the soil horizon A into a cultural layer and extraction of soil material for earthwork formation such as construction of the semi-circular fortification rampart. Buried soil horizons were additionally mixed by active local bioturbation. Three periods of deposit formation were identified. The occurrence of soil erosion due to intensive deforestation in the earliest period of settlement erection was indicated by the deepest colluvial layer M1. During the Viking settlement period formation of the exposed colluvial layer M2 and cultural deposits must have been simultaneous but at different locations. After the Viking Age settlement period, the erosion was activated by agricultural land use in late medieval time. This was clearly seen in the central part of the valley, where cultural deposits were covered by colluvium. This study closes a gap in the long-term archaeological and geoarchaeological study of Hedeby, i.e. it contributes to the discussion of the relationship between human activity and landscape development in this significant settlement.

However, there still is a lack of robustly dated terrestrial climate records from Arctic Norway. Here, we present a high-resolution relative glacier activity record covering the past ∼10,000 cal. a BP from the northern outlet of the Langfjordjøkelen ice cap in Arctic Norway. This record is reconstructed from detailed geomorphic mapping, multi-proxy sedimentary fingerprinting and analyses of distal glacier-fed lake sediments. We used Principal Component Analysis to characterize sediments of glacial origin and trace them in a chain of downstream lakes. Of the variability in the sediment record of the uppermost Lake Jøkelvatnet, 73% can be explained by the first Principal Component axis and tied directly to upstream glacier erosion, whereas the glacial signal becomes weaker in the more distal Lakes Store Rundvatnet and Storvatnet. Magnetic susceptibility and titanium count rates were found to be the most suitable indicators of Holocene glacier activity in the distal glacier-fed lakes. The complete deglaciation of the valley of Sør-Tverrfjorddalen occurred ∼10,000 cal. a BP, followed by a reduced or absent glacier during the Holocene Thermal Optimum. The Langfjordjøkelen ice cap reformed with the onset of the Neoglacial ∼4100 cal. a BP, and the gradually increasing glacier activity culminated at the end of the Little Ice Age in the early 20th century. Over the past 2000 cal. a BP, the record reflects frequent high-amplitude glacier fluctuations. Periods of reduced glacier activity were centered around 1880, 1600, 1250 and 950 cal. a BP, while intervals of increased glacier activity occurred around 1680, 1090, 440 and 25 cal. a BP. The large-scale Holocene glacier activity of the Langfjordjøkelen ice cap is consistent with regional temperature proxy reconstructions and glacier variability across Norway. Long-term changes in the extent of the northern outlet of the Langfjordjøkelen ice cap largely followed trends in regional summer temperatures, whereas winter season atmospheric variability may have triggered decadal-scale glacial fluctuations and generally affected the amplitude of glacier events.","","article","","114","","","Reconstructing Holocene glacier activity at Langfjordjøkelen, Arctic Norway, using multi-proxy fingerprinting of distal glacier-fed lake sediments","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379115000633","0277-3791","2015","78-99","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Officially, the successive waves caused 9789 deaths, although numerous additional casualties could not be recorded. The origin of this epidemic has been the subject of a controversy involving two opposing theories. The first hypothesis, put forward by renowned American academics, was that the cholera epidemic originated from the environment, due to the proliferation and transmission of aquatic Vibrio cholerae bacteria driven by a confluence of circumstances, i.e., the earthquake followed by a hot summer and, ultimately, heavy rainfall and flooding. The alternative hypothesis, which was subsequently confirmed by epidemiological and genomic studies, attributed the epidemic to the recent importation of cholera by UN peacekeepers recently arrived from Nepal, and to a river polluted with sewage. In late 2016, the Secretary General of the United Nations finally begged the Haitian people for forgiveness. This implicit recognition of the role of the UN in the cholera epidemic helped to fund the ongoing fight against it. Case-area targeted interventions aimed at interrupting cholera transmission were reinforced, which resulted in the extinction of the epidemic within two years. In the meantime, several phylogenetic studies on Vibrio cholerae during the seventh cholera pandemic demonstrated that local environmental and global epidemic Vibrio populations were distinct. These studies also showed that epidemics arose when the bacterium had diversified and that it had spread during transmission events associated with human travel.","","article","","51","","","Cholera in Haiti","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075549822200029X","0755-4982","2022","104136","La Presse Médicale"

The main centers of pre-colonial metallurgy are well-known from archeological artifacts, but temporal gaps inherent in this record handicap a finer understanding of the modalities of ore exploitation by succeeding civilizations. A continuous record over time of trace metals emitted during ore smelting operations make lake sediments excellent candidates to fill those gaps. Two millennia of metallurgy were reconstructed from atmospherically derived metals together with lead (Pb) isotope ratios in two dated sediment cores from Lake Titicaca. The first evidence for metallurgy is found during the apogee of the Tiwanaku state (AD 800–1150), with a higher copper (Cu) accumulation that can be attributed to the smelting of local Cu ores, based on Pb isotopic fingerprinting. During the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1150–1450), recorded peaks in metal deposition that persisted for ∼ twenty years show that mining activities were intensive but discontinuous. Pb isotope ratios suggest diversified extractive activities, mainly located in the southern part of the central Altiplano. Finally, the most intense mining epoch began during the Inca Empire (ca. AD 1500) and lasted until the end of the Colonial Period (AD 1830), with unprecedented metal deposition over this interval. Pb isotope fingerprinting shows that mining operations occurred mainly in the Lake Titicaca and Potosi areas and were responsible for metal emissions recorded in the entire Altiplano, as evidenced by other studies.","","article","","34","","","Reconstructing two millennia of copper and silver metallurgy in the Lake Titicaca region (Bolivia/Peru) using trace metals and lead isotopic composition","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213305421000114","2213-3054","2021","100288","Anthropocene"

This chapter reviews the basic physical–chemical processes associated with these unusual isotope effects as well as natural sample measurements on Earth (present and past) and Mars. The Earth's earliest atmosphere (billion years) and near past (100000 years to present) can be followed using mass-independent isotopic measurements. Sulfur and oxygen isotopic composition of sulfate and nitrate aerosols in ice cores and sediments helped reveal the stratospheric chemistry and biogeochemical processes. Present-day greenhouse gas fates and budgets, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, are also presented.

A commonly referenced aquatic organism, mollusks represent a group of major interest in toxicological studies. Both gastropods and bivalves have external mineral shells that protects their soft tissue from predation and desiccation. These structures are composed of an organic matrix and an inorganic matrix, both of which are affected by environmental changes, including exposure to hazardous chemicals. This literature review evaluates studies that propose mollusk shell alterations as biomarkers of aquatic system quality. The studies included herein show that changes to natural variables such as salinity, temperature, food availability, hydrodynamics, desiccation, predatory pressure, and substrate type may influence the form, structure, and composition of mollusk shells. However, in the spatial and temporal studies performed in coastal waters around the world, shells of organisms sampled from multi-impacted areas were found to differ in the form and composition of both organic and inorganic matrices relative to shells from less contaminated areas. Though these findings are useful, the toxicological studies were often performed in the field and were not able to attribute shell alterations to a specific molecule. It is known that the organic matrix of shells regulates the biomineralization process; proteomic analyses of shells may therefore elucidate how different contaminants affect shell biomineralization. Further research using approaches that allow a clearer distinction between shell alterations caused by natural variations and those caused by anthropogenic influence, as well as studies to identify which molecule is responsible for such alterations or to determine the ecological implications of shell alterations, are needed before any responses can be applied universally.","","article","","265","","","Mollusk shell alterations resulting from coastal contamination and other environmental factors","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749119375839","0269-7491","2020","114881","Environmental Pollution"

The two main rivers, the Kupa and the Rječina, rise under the same mountain range, but belong to two different watersheds (Black Sea and Adriatic Sea). The karst aquifer of Gorski Kotar is a potentially important source of drinking water for two neighboring countries, Croatia and Slovenia (Central and South Europe), and is strongly influenced by both Mediterranean and continental weather conditions. It is a part of the Dinaric karst, which is “locus typicus” for karst worldwide and one of the most typical karst areas in the world. To answer the main question of our research, baseline data were thoroughly collected comprising stable isotopes, concentration of dissolved and total trace metals in water, and multi-elemental analyses of river sediments, together with other physical-chemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity and temperature). Total dissolved solid (TDS) was not measured but estimated as (EC) 0.67. Such multi-technique approach was applied for the first time in the Dinaric karst systems. Multi-elemental analysis of fine sediment fraction (<63μm) of eight samples was performed by ICP-MS. Elemental composition of sediments is quite different in the two studied river valleys, which indicates different origin of their waters. Also, concentrations of selected metals were compared with existing sediment quality criteria and anthropogenic influence is evaluated and discussed. Analytical results of major ions determined in three springs (Kupa spring, Rječina spring, Zvir spring in the City of Rijeka) were used to construct a Piper diagram, which showed that they are of a Ca–Na–HCO3–Cl type. The highest concentration of Mg is present in the Kupa spring, while the highest concentrations of Na and Cl are present in the Zvir spring. Groundwaters are underlain by limestone, less by dolomite and are under a maritime influence. There is a big difference with the main groundwater types reported in North Africa, i.e. in the south Mediterranean Sea, where two main groundwater types are Na–Cl and Ca–SO4–Cl. Concentrations of total and dissolved fractions of trace metals in surface water samples were determined by voltammetry and compared to the European Water Framework Directive values. Concentrations of total Pb and Zn are significantly higher in the water of the Kupa spring than the Rječina spring, suggesting that the karst water bodies of the two springs are not of the same origin. In addition, stable isotope composition (deuterium and oxygen-18) was determined in the spring waters sampled during low and high water conditions. Due to the significant difference in oxygen isotope-ratios it was concluded that the karst reservoir for the Kupa and Rječina springs is not identical. The results obtained from the combination of physical–chemical, geochemical (water and sediment) and isotope multi-technique analyses pointed out that even though the springs of the Kupa and Rječina rivers originate from the same mountain range, they do not drain the same karst aquifer.","","article","","73","","","Geochemical and stable isotopic variability within two rivers rising under the same mountain, but belonging to two distant watersheds","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009281913000093","0009-2819","2013","293-308","Geochemistry"

It records ship position, speed and other behavior attributes at specific time intervals in all voyages at sea and in ports. However, the current studies in ship behavior analyze the behavior patterns either with a subjective choice of classification for behavior differences among the groups of ships or without any classification at all. In order to fill this gap, a new methodology for ship classification in ports based on behavior clustering is developed by analyzing AIS data from the port of Rotterdam. Besides a proper data preparation, the proposed methodology consists of two steps: step I, clustering ship behavior in a port area and identifying the characteristics of the clusters; step II, classifying ships to such behavior clusters based on the ship characteristics. The clustering results present both the behavior patterns and the behavior change patterns for ship path and speed over ground, which are the dominant behavior attributes for ships in ports. Some patterns of integral ship behavior can also be revealed by investigating the correlation between the two behavior attributes. Our research has shown that length and beam can be adopted as explanatory variable to classify ships to the corresponding behavior clusters. The classifiers are developed based on both unsupervised discretization (equal width binning) and supervised discretization (Chi2). The performances of classifiers are compared by three evaluation metrics, including Average Accuracy, F1score, and AUC. We found that the classification based on multi-criteria is more accurate than using a single criterion. The classifications based on Chi2 discretization outperform the ones with equal width discretization. The outcome leads to a systematic understanding of ship behavior in a port area and can be used to predict the ship behavior pattern based on their characteristics and simulate the ship behavior.","","article","","175","","","Ship classification based on ship behavior clustering from AIS data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801818304761","0029-8018","2019","176-187","Ocean Engineering"

In this study, a 15-year diurnal variation of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) was retrieved from multi-sensor satellite images and in-situ hyperspectral measurements using Radiative Transfer (RT) modeling in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The existing RT model 2SeaColor was inverted against time series of in-situ hyperspectral measurements of water leaving reflectances (Rrs [sr−1]) for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs (i.e., Chlorophyll-a (Chla), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM)) on a daily basis between 2003 and 2018 at the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS) located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. At the same time, the existing coupled atmosphere-hydro-optical RT model MOD2SEA was used for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs from time series of multi-sensor satellite images of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard ENVISAT, Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 between 2003 and 2018 over the Dutch Wadden Sea.

This study analyzes the long-term averages of aerosol optical and radiative properties obtained by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) version 3 at four sites in Indonesia representing fire prone areas (Palangka Raya, Pontianak, Jambi: 2012–2020), and urban-industrial (Bandung: 2009–2018). We examined the seasonal variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV), and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) combined with meteorological parameters at these Indonesian sites. Multiple clustering techniques from different relationships among various aerosol optical and radiative parameters was employed to further study the aerosol type in respect to different seasonality. The results exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern at all sites except Bandung, whereas AOD increased owing to forest and peat fire outbreaks during the dry season. The trend in AOD annual depicts an increase in Bandung as emission from urban/industrial increases episodically, while it depicts a decrease at the three biomass burning sites. As AOD increased, Palangka Raya, Pontianak, and Jambi exhibited wider ranges of observed AE (1.2–1.8) and high FMF (>0.8) in the dry burning period (June to October). On the other hand, Bandung has more aerosol distribution in the range of FMF values 0.6–1 and AE 1–1.6, compared with other sites, suggesting contribution of complex aerosol emission from different sources and likely due to the formation of secondary aerosol production from trace gases. Palangka Raya, Pontianak, and Jambi exhibited non-absorbing characteristics, as indicated by high SSA (>0.95), high FMF, and high EAE values (1.2–1.7) with no discrepancy in seasonal patterns, implying that biomass burning aerosols in Indonesia tend to cool the atmosphere with strong scattering rather than absorbing. At Bandung, aerosols mixed with slightly absorbing and non-absorbing aerosols owing to urban and industrial emissions.

Annually laminated speleothems may fill this knowledge gap by providing paleo-hydroclimate proxy data extending beyond the instrumental period. In this study, replicated oxygen isotope (δ18O) time series from two stalagmites from Pouatea (Pu17) and Nurau (Nu16) caves in the southern Cook Islands were used to reconstruct the variability of effective infiltration over the past 350 years (1672–2019 CE) based on observational rainfall data and cave monitoring and calcite farming experiments. The reconstructed infiltration was then compared to available reconstructions of known climate drivers of the South Pacific. Significant dry and wet periods over the last 350 years were identified based on the δ18O signal of compact/porous calcite fabric and their δ13C signals. The hydroclimate significance of these proxies was validated through comparison with the instrumental records. We could not reach an annual resolution of reconstructed infiltration, due to a combination of stable isotope sampling limitations and mixing effects within the aquifer. Nevertheless, the combined δ18O record of Pu17 and Nu16 identifies that the main driver of infiltration and, hence rainfall variability, in the southern Cook Islands is the location of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), which in turn is modulated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study demonstrates the hydroclimate significance of speleothem fabrics when combined with O and C stable isotopes, and adds paleoclimate information to a region that has a paucity of data.","","article","","289","","","Controls on rainfall variability in the tropical South Pacific for the last 350 years reconstructed from oxygen isotopes in stalagmites from the Cook Islands","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379122002645","0277-3791","2022","107633","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Insight into the full spectrum of IPWP climate dynamics, however, is limited by the spatial and temporal coverage of the climate data. In particular, the relationships among the changes in the SSTs, the precipitation patterns mainly associated with rainfalls from Asian Monsoons (AM), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are poorly understood. To help us further assess the climate linkages, we have reconstructed a more spatial SST pattern during the Holocene by using multiple SST proxies (alkenone unsaturation index U37k' and Mg/Ca of planktic foraminifer) in the Eastern Tropical Indian Ocean (ETIO), the western margin of the IPWP based on three sedimentary cores from NW offshore of Sumatra, and offshore of Sumatra and Java (BS24, SO139-74KL, and SO184-100430). Stable hydrogen and carbon isotope records of terrestrial plant waxes from a nearby marine sediment core SO189-144KL and geochemical tracers measured from the coral reefs within the Mentawai Islands in the ETIO are used here as AM driven precipitation and IOD records in our data synthesis. Not surprisingly, our synthesis suggests that insolation plays a major role that has been responsible for the increased SSTs in ETIO since the early Holocene, while other mechanisms remain effective in determining the timing of our reconstructed SST variations. In particular, our SST pattern shares less similarity with that of coral Sr/Ca SST and is decoupled from the coral IOD events in the mid-Holocene. We interpret that our reconstructed ETIO SSTs are driven dominantly by the solar forcing, but are also affected by other internal climate mechanisms such as the local shifts in AM-controlled upwelling and precipitation, episodic reductions in the flow of warm western Pacific surface water into the Indian Ocean due to increased precipitation over the Indonesian archipelago, and long-term ENSO or IOD-like climate change.","","article","","490","","","Evidence of solar insolation and internal forcing of sea surface temperature changes in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean during the Holocene","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618218302805","1040-6182","2018","1-9","Quaternary International"

However, this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather, potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures. In the present study, peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the UK are analysed using both stationary and non-stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) framework. Nine candidate covariates are used for non-stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non-stationarity in each flood series. Very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends, which suggests that time-varying non-stationary flood models may not always be suitable, and the use of physically-based covariates can provide better-fitting models. In particular, the non-stationary models using rainfall-related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations, thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding. Moreover, two atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic Pattern, were found to be closely related to the non-stationarity of flooding at a number of stations. Unlike rainfall, however, the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant; hence, they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple-covariate non-stationary model. Besides, a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally. For the majority of stations (70%), the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non-stationary model than the use of a single covariate.","","article","","597","","","An investigation on the non-stationarity of flood frequency across the UK","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421003565","0022-1694","2021","126309","Journal of Hydrology"

The same elements were also quantified in marine sediments, where geological anomalies were found for arsenic, chromium and nickel. Metal transfer seems to be deeply influenced by different habitats. The carnivorous isopod E. spinigera, which spends most of its lifetime on the seabed, was found to have the highest concentrations of most trace elements, such as Al, As, Cd, Ce, Cr, Fe, La, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V and Zn, and consequently have the highest bioaccumulation factors (BAFs). Moreover, the estimation of biota sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) revealed that cadmium, copper and zinc concentrations were higher in the isopod than in the sediment. Conversely, in the carnivorous chaetognath F. enflata, which is not a benthonic species, the highest levels of copper and tin were found.

Integrated water vapor transport (IVT) analysis depicted an intense and long-duration CAT 5 atmospheric river stretching from the Arabian Sea across South India into the Bay of Bengal. A high-pressure ridge over the eastern Arabian Sea and western India and a trough over the Bay of Bengal forming a subsection of monsoon wave-train was observed ahead of the flood event. The monsoon trough was exacerbated by the synchronous effect of a polar westerly jet trough that created an anomalous low-pressure region covering central and eastern India and a quasi-stationary depression over the Bay of Bengal. The system favored continuous supply of moisture from the Indian Ocean into Kerala. To locate major sources of moisture, the air parcels that rained out to generate extreme precipitation are tracked backwards using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT). The backward trajectory analyses reveal that on 13th August more than 60% of the moisture was contributed from the Central-Eastern Indian Ocean, with some intermittent contributions from the Arabian Sea; while on 14th–16th August, about 25–30% was contributed from the Arabian Sea","","article","","253","","","Atmospheric river linked to extreme rainfall events over Kerala in August 2018","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809521000405","0169-8095","2021","105488","Atmospheric Research"

However, in modern times, we have come to realize how these phenomena can affect the different technological systems on which we rely. High-frequency radio opened up communication links to remote communities, except when the ionosphere was disrupted by space weather disturbances. Such disturbances are now a problem for commercial aircraft using transpolar routes. As long-distance communications shifted to using satellites, Telesat's Anik series of satellites provided phone and television links across the country, but suffered a major blow when energetic electrons damaged the attitude control circuitry for Anik-E2. After heroic efforts to implement an alternative control system, the satellite was brought back into operation 5 months later. On the ground, the expanding power network was vulnerable to the extra currents created during geomagnetic disturbances and on March 13, 1989, a major magnetic storm caused widespread effects, including the blackout of the Hydro-Québec power system. Canadian operators of aeromagnetic surveys and directional drilling have also had to cope with geomagnetic disturbances. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are another technology affected by ionospheric disturbances and a number of correction services have been developed, including the Canadian Coast Guard's DGPS service for maritime users. In parallel with the increasing engineering requirements to design or manage systems in Canada that are affected by space weather, the science behind space weather phenomena has been a particular focus of Canadian scientists who have made great contributions in this area. The same high-latitude location that makes Canada more exposed to space weather hazards also makes it a prime location for space weather observations and the country is now a giant array of space weather research instruments. The challenge for the future is to use the new knowledge being generated to help protect Canadian infrastructure from future extreme space weather events.","","incollection","Elsevier","","Extreme Events in Geospace","978-0-12-812700-1","Chapter 26 - Dealing With Space Weather: The Canadian Experience","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128127001000261","","2018","635-656",""

Extreme rain events have resulted in landslides and floods, accompanied with a loss of life and the deterioration of infrastructure. To project the future changes of extreme precipitation in Philippines, we investigated the observations based on 53 stations and 24 CMIP6 (Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project Phase 6) models. We applied generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and multivariate bias-correction to series of annual maximum daily precipitation (AMP1) data acquired from the observations and models under three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). We employed a model ensemble method that takes both independence and performance of model into account, which is named as the PI-weighting. To quantify the uncertainty of predicting the future AMP1, variance decomposition method was applied. Return values for 20-year and 50-year as well as the return periods of the AMP1 compared to the past (1975–2014), were estimated for two future time which are period 1 (2021–2060) and period 2 (2061–2100). From this study, we predict that the relative increases of 20-year return value of the AMP1 from the past to the year 2100 be about 8.5% in the SSP2-4.5, 11.6% in the SSP3-7.0, and 17% in the SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, in the spatial median over the Philippines. We also found out that a 1-in-20 year (1-in-50 year) AMP1 observed in the past in the Philippines will likely become a 1-in-16 (1-in-37) year, a 1-in-17 (1-in-32) year, and a 1-in-14 (1-in-31) year event by 2100 under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively.

Analysis of individual cases is important in understanding the extent of these changes on spatial scales relevant to stakeholders. Here, we present a probabilistic attribution analysis of the extreme precipitation that fell in large parts of the Netherlands on 28 July 2014. Using a step-by-step approach, we aim to identify changes in intensity and likelihood of such an event as a result of anthropogenic global warming while highlighting the challenges in performing robust event attribution on high-impact precipitation events that occur at small scales. A method based on extreme value theory is applied to observational data in addition to global and regional climate model ensembles that pass a robust model evaluation process. Results based on observations suggest a strong and significant increase in the intensity and frequency of a 2014-type event as a result of anthropogenic climate change but trends in the model ensembles used are considerably smaller. Our results are communicated alongside considerable uncertainty, highlighting the difficulty in attributing events of this nature.

The analysis covered the longitudinal belt ranging from the Iberian Peninsula to Japan, seen as the preferential pathway for the Holocenic spread of grapevine and many other crops in Eurasia. Spectral analysis was considered as the criterion of investigation and the Holocenic cycles were analyzed considering different geochemical and biological proxies, of which seven are directly referred to vine. In this context the relation of the abovementioned proxies with spectral peaks of possible causal factors like Solar activity (SA), North Atlantic oceanic factors (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation - AMO and North Atlantic Oscillation - NAO), and subtropical oceanic factors (El Nino Southern Oscillation - ENSO) was also analyzed. In order to acquire a sufficiently wide number of proxies sensitive to the causal factors, we referred to a latitudinal belt wider than the one colonized by vine, also acquiring proxy from the Scandinavian area, notoriously susceptible to North Atlantic forcings. The analysis of the proxy spectral peaks, considering 20 classes with a 50-years step in the 0–1000 years range, showed that the 50% of the classes have a higher frequency of peaks at East than West, the 20% a higher frequency at West than East and the 10% an equal frequency, showing the efficiency of the propagation of Western signals towards the center of Eurasia. The search of the causal factors spectral peaks in the proxy series showed that AMO, NAO and SA acted with a certain regularity on the entire belt investigated both latitudinally and longitudinally, while spectral peaks linked to ENSO underwent a considerable attenuation moving northward. Finally, the specific analysis on viticultural proxies showed common peaks with causal factors.","","article","","635","","","Influence of climate cycles on grapevine domestication and ancient migrations in Eurasia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718313214","0048-9697","2018","1240-1254","Science of The Total Environment"

We closely examine ground-based high-quality observations of aerosol characteristics including radiative forcing from several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), the Himalayan foothills and the Tibetan Plateau, relatively poorly studied regions with several sensitive ecosystems of global importance, as well as highly vulnerable large populations. This paper presents a state-of-the-art treatment of the warming that arises from these particles, using a combination of new measurements and modeling techniques. This is a first-time analysis of its kind, including ground-based observations, satellite data, and model simulations, which reveals that the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) in the atmosphere is clearly high over the IGP and the Himalayan foothills (80–135 Wm−2 per unit aerosol optical depth (AOD)), with values being greater at higher elevations. AOD is >0.30 and single scattering albedo (SSA) is ∼0.90 throughout the year over this region. The mean ARFE is 2–4 times higher here than over other polluted sites in South and East Asia, owing to higher AOD and aerosol absorption (i.e., lower SSA). Further, the observed annual mean aerosol-induced atmospheric heating rates (0.5–0.8 Kelvin/day), which are significantly higher than previously reported values for the region, imply that the aerosols alone could account for >50 % of the total warming (aerosols + greenhouse gases) of the lower atmosphere and surface over this region. We demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art models used in climate assessments significantly underestimate aerosol-induced heating, efficiency and warming over the Hindu Kush – Himalaya – Tibetan Plateau (HKHTP) region, indicating a need for a more realistic representation of aerosol properties, especially of black carbon and other aerosols. The significant, regionally coherent aerosol-induced warming that we observe in the high altitudes of the region, is a significant factor contributing to increasing air temperature, observed accelerated retreat of the glaciers, and changes in the hydrological cycle and precipitation patterns over this region. Thus, aerosols are heating up the Himalayan climate, and will remain a key factor driving climate change over the region.","","article","","894","","","Aerosols heat up the Himalayan climate","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723033569","0048-9697","2023","164733","Science of The Total Environment"

Annual frequencies were highest over inland areas of southern and central England (5.0–7.5 events per 10,000km2, per year) and decreased markedly to the north (<1.0 events per 10,000km2, per year over north and west Scotland). Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) tornado data revealed that 27.2% of lines produced at least one tornado. The environment of tornadic and non-tornadic lines was investigated by analysis of available observations, from which representative values of various environmental parameters were obtained. Tornadic lines were found to be associated with significantly larger pre-line surface-based CAPE, line-normal forward motion, cross-line horizontal wind veer, and cross-line temperature decrease. Furthermore, a tendency for tornadic lines to occur near the core, or under the left exit region, of mid-level jets was apparent.","","article","","123","","","A provisional climatology of cool-season convective lines in the UK","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809512003201","0169-8095","2013","180-196","Atmospheric Research"

The results of multivariate statistical analysis and geochemical mapping revealed that water quality is affected by contaminated drainage from abandoned mine sites. Acid mine drainage with very high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Al, Pb and Zn was identified in a few samples collected from mine openings and near waste dumps. In general, neutral drainage with elevated concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, As, Ni and Cd was observed due to buffering by carbonate dissolution. The contamination is spatially limited around abandoned mine sites, suggesting that metal(oid)s are sequestered in secondary phases that form under near-neutral and oxidizing conditions. However, the analysis of seasonal variations in trace metal concentrations showed that the transport of metal contaminants in water is highly variable according to hydrological conditions. During low flow conditions, trace metals are likely to be rapidly sequestered in Fe-oxyhydroxides and carbonate minerals in the karst aquifer and the river sediments, while low or no surface runoff in intermittent rivers limits the transport of contaminants in the environment. On the other hand, significant amounts of metal(loid)s can be transported under high flow conditions, primarily in dissolved form. Dissolved metal(loid) concentrations in groundwater remained elevated despite dilution by uncontaminated water, likely as a result of the increased leaching of mine wastes and the flushing of contaminated waters from mine workings. This work shows that groundwater is the main source of contamination to the environment and highlights the need to better understand the fate of trace metals in karst water systems.","","article","","873","","","Impact of past mining activities on water quality in a karst area in the Cévennes region, Southern France","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723008902","0048-9697","2023","162274","Science of The Total Environment"

This additional source of ozone is able to explain many puzzling features of ozone, including its longitudinal and hemispherical asymmetry. Moreover, the chapter shows that the long-term variations of atmospheric specific humidity at 150hPa covariate with the ozone at 70hPa, as well as with the centennial variations of galactic cosmic rays (GCR).

These methods can be used to both find and accurately quantifying leaks, and are visible and tangible data for public and ecosystem safety. To be most reliable and accurate, however, the measurements must be interpreted in the context of natural variations in gas concentration and flux. Such baseline data vary both spatially and temporally due to natural processes, and a clear understanding of their values and distributions is critical for interpreting near-surface gas monitoring techniques. The best example is CO2 itself, as the production of this gas via soil respiration can create a wide range of concentrations and fluxes that must be separated from, and not confused with, CO2 that may leak towards the surface from a storage reservoir. The present article summarizes baseline studies performed by the authors at various sites having different climates and geological settings from both Europe and North America, with focus given to the range of values that can result from near surface processes and how different techniques or data processing approaches can be used to help distinguish a leakage signal from an anomalous, shallow biogenic signal.","","article","","63","","","Baseline variability in onshore near surface gases and implications for monitoring at CO2 storage sites","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610214022620","1876-6102","2014","4155-4162","Energy Procedia"

However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g. DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem- and domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps, this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation, autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to showcase the application of the conceptualisation. This work discusses the state-of-the-art in DT, addresses relevant and timely DT questions, and identifies novel research questions, thus contributing to a better understanding of the DT paradigm and advancing the theory and practice of DT and its allied technologies.","","article","","30","","","Digital Twins: State of the art theory and practice, challenges, and open research questions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452414X22000516","2452-414X","2022","100383","Journal of Industrial Information Integration"

The BTB is the subject of geological research due to its rich coal deposits that have the potential for oil and gas. The purpose of the present study is to examine the origins, depositional environments, and thermal history of the selected coals and the processes that influence their quality. Coal samples from different open cast coal mines in the middle BTB were examined using proximate and ultimate, x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), laser ablation induced coupled plasma (LA-ICPMS), and petrographical analyses. The coal samples contained mainly quartz, kaolinite, and organic carbon. The XRD spectra peaks revealed the triclinic and monoclinic structure of kaolin. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratios confirmed the dominance of quartz and kaolinite. The Ni/Co versus V/Cr, Cu/Zn, and V/Mo values in the studied coals suggest oxic depositional environments, whereas the V/(Ni + V) and V/(V + Cr) values indicate oxic to suboxic conditions. The Ce/Ce∗ values are slightly below 1, which indicates a suboxic depositional environment. Maceral texture is indicative of transformations from sub-bituminous to high volatile C or B bituminous coal. The maceral components and mineral matter (≥10%) of the studied coals imply deposition in the planar margin mire, and a river system of planar margin mire environments, respectively. The high gelification index (GI) and tissue preservation index (TPI) values indicate peat accumulation developed within a wet forest swamp. The ternary diagram of the maceral component suggests deposition in a wet moor environment with intermittent moderate to high flooding episodes. The studied coals are sub-hydrous vitrinite inferring hydrogen-poor and thermally immature characteristics. The low V and Ni contents, low H/C and high O/C, indicate Type Ⅲ terrestrial organic matter with the potential to generate gaseous hydrocarbons. The investigated coals were deposited by the river within telmatic, limnic, and limno-telmatic zones in the planar margin mire depositional environments. Overall, the integrated petrologic and geochemical data used in this study provides a reliable approach for the assessment of coal depositional environments.","","article","","3","","","Geochemical, mineralogical, and petrological characteristics of the Cretaceous coal from the middle Benue Trough Basin, Nigeria: Implication for coal depositional environments","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666759222000294","2666-7592","2022","300-313","Energy Geoscience"

Understanding the interaction between fire and climate in this far north region is crucial for predicting future changes of wildfires. However, fire records over geological time scales are still scarce in the high latitudes of NH to provide comprehensive pictures of the fire history in this region. Here, we used the flux of levoglucosan (Lev) and its isomers in a sediment profile YN from Svalbard, high Arctic, as proxies for the changes in biomass burning from ∼9–2 kyr BP (thousand years before present). Backward trajectories and comparison with charcoal syntheses from various regions confirmed that the Lev transport to the profile site is sourced from the fire activities in the boreal NH, especially in northern Europe and northern Siberia. The Lev flux exhibited a slight overall decreasing trend at ∼3 %/kyr (p = 0.09) over the study period, as well as centennial maxima at ∼9, 8–7, 6, 5, and 4–3 kyr BP (p = 0.06). On sub-orbital scales, the long-term decrease in fire activities corresponded to trends of summer temperature in the extratropics of the NH (p = 0.01, r = 0.42), reflecting their regulation of fuel availability and flammability. On centennial to sub-millennial time scales, high levels of biomass burning were associated with periods of increased North Atlantic ice-rafted debris (p = 0.02, r = 0.38), which were indicative of cold and dry conditions over most of the source regions, reflecting the impacts of dryness on fuel flammability. The results suggested that enhanced Arctic amplification on centennial time scales may reduce biomass burning in most of the boreal NH, although fires in some mid-latitude regions may be facilitated.","","article","","867","","","Holocene changes in biomass burning in the boreal Northern Hemisphere, reconstructed from anhydrosugar fluxes in an Arctic sediment profile","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972300075X","0048-9697","2023","161460","Science of The Total Environment"

The high resolution of the Mulyoungari records allows the detection of multidecadal to centennial-scale climate change with various cycles. This enables comparisons with important paleoclimate proxies such as total solar irradiation (ΔTSI) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western tropical Pacific (WTP). Spectral analyses of pollen and magnetic susceptibility (MS) data identify significant periodicities of 780, 470, 135–145, and 50–70years. The Mulyoungari swamp responded sensitively to global climate change during the Holocene, showing well known Holocene cycles in the results. Our tree pollen index of warmness (TPIW) shows important late Holocene cold events associated with low sunspot periods such as Oort, Wolf, Spörer, and Maunder Minimum. Comparisons among standard Z-scores of filtered TPIW, ΔTSI, and other paleoclimate records from central and northeastern China, off the coast of northern Japan, southern Philippines, and Peru all demonstrate significant relationships. This suggests that solar activity drove Holocene variations in both East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

This study aims to develop an approach to couple the FRAM to reinforcement learning (RL) to explore complex operations. The developed approach is called the functional RL approach and constitutes a novel way of using a FRAM model to explore functionality using an artificial intelligent (AI) agent who responds to reward values assigned to functional parameters. To exemplify the approach, an agent is employed to perform the role of a patient and explore a functional environment generated by the FRAM. Reward values are considered to motivate the agent in order to explore the environment to achieve its objective. The ability of the developed approach is examined using different scenarios implemented in healthcare operations. The results of using the functional RL approach indicate that the approach is able to specify the functional route taken by the agent and to examine the performance of the system based on accumulated rewards. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that the developed functional RL approach provides a novel means to explore operational environments to identify the routes that have potential to affect the system performance.

In this method, feature disentanglement is adopted to decompose the high-dimensional measured temperature information based on Tucker decomposition. The extracted dynamic feature is filtered and predicted by incremental dynamic learning, and the incremental data information is balanced by maximizing the Gaussian likelihood. Then, the dynamic feature can be entangled with the stable features to predict the ocean temperature field. Last, incremental residual learning can compensate for the feature disentanglement learning error.

Quantitative measurements have been performed by using two different Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) datasets. A ground-based survey using two different ground-coupled systems equipped with 100 MHz and 35 MHz antennas was performed in 2004. In 2015 the dataset was collected by using a helicopter-borne step frequency GPR equipped with a 100 MHz antenna. Through a critical discussion of the two different methodologies, we show how both approaches are useful to estimate the ice volume within a glacier, as well as its morphological characteristics and changes with time, even if datasets are acquired in different periods of the year. The observed 2004–2014 ice volume reduction of the Marmolada glacier is equal to about 30%, while the area covered by ice decreased by about 22%. The glacier is now splitted in several separated units. It is very likely that the fragmentation of the Marmolada glacier observed in the period 2004–2014 was accelerated due to irregular karst topography. By applying the observed 2004–2014 ice-melting trend for the future although the Marmolada glacier might behave slightly differently compared to glaciers on non-karstic terrains owing to dominant vertical subglacial drainage, it will likely disappear by the year 2050.

Zooplankton is dominated by copepods (mainly Clausocalanus, Paracalanus, Oncaea and Oithona), except in warm periods, when outbreaks of cladocerans (mainly Penilia avirostris but also Podon intermedius and Pleopis polyphemoides) outnumber copepods, accounting for more than 80% of total abundance on occasion. Zooplankton diversity was found to be higher in deeper waters while the density of most taxa (but not their abundance) decreased towards the ocean. On top of this general coast-ocean pattern a north–south gradient could also be distinguished resulting in three distinct zones. In relation to environmental structuring, mesoscale processes, sea surface temperature, winds, river runoff and primary productivity were identified as main factors shaping this zonation. Overall, zooplankton abundance showed a decreasing trend during the study period (2001–2015), caused by a drop of summer abundances, that was mainly driven by cladocerans.","","article","","186","","","Gulf of Cadiz zooplankton: Community structure, zonation and temporal variation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007966112030118X","0079-6611","2020","102379","Progress in Oceanography"

The real-world network contains different size clusters because of the edges with different relationship types. These clusters also reflect some features of nodes, which can contribute to the optimization of the feature representation of nodes. However, existing network embedding methods do not distinguish these relationship types. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised network representation learning model that can encode edge relationship information. Firstly, an objective function is defined, which can learn the edge vectors by implicit clustering. Then, a biased random walk is designed to generate a series of node sequences, which are put into Skip-Gram to learn the low dimensional node representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several network datasets. Compared with the state-of-art baselines, the proposed method is able to achieve favorable and stable results in multi-label classification and link prediction tasks.","","article","","361","","","Graph representation learning with encoding edges","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231219310835","0925-2312","2019","29-39","Neurocomputing"

The surface cooling detected at several meteorological stations ranged from −0.014 to −0.021 °C a−1, whilst upper troposphere (850–300 gpm) records at radiosonde of Puerto Montt (41°26′S/73°07′W) revealed warming between 0.019 and 0.031 °C a−1. Regional rainfall data collected from 1961 to 2000 showed the overall decrease with a maximum rate of −15 mm a−2 at Valdivia st. (39°38′S/73°05′W). These ongoing climatic changes, especially the precipitation reduction, seem to be related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena which has been more frequent after 1976. Glaciers within the Chilean Lake District have significantly retreated during recent decades, in an apparent out-of-phase response to the regional surface cooling. Moreover, very little is known about upper troposphere changes and how they can enhance the glacier responses. In order to analyse their behaviour in the context of the observed climate changes, Casa Pangue glacier (41°08′S/71°52′W) has been selected and studied by comparing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) computed at three different dates throughout the last four decades. This approach allowed the determination of ice elevation changes between 1961 and 1998, yielding a mean thinning rate of −2.3±0.6 m a−1. Strikingly, when ice thinning is computed for the period between 1981 and 1998, the resulting rate is 50% higher (−3.6±0.6 m a−1). This enhanced trend and the related area loss and frontal retreat suggests that Casa Pangue might currently be suffering negative mass balances in response to the upper troposphere warming and decreased precipitation of the last 25–30 yr, as well as debris cover would not prevent the glacier from a fast reaction to climate forcing. Most of recent glaciological studies regarding Andean glaciers have concentrated on low altitude changes, namely frontal variations, however, in order to better understand the regional glacier changes, new data are necessary, especially from the accumulation areas.","","article","","59","","","Climate changes and recent glacier behaviour in the Chilean Lake District","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818106002980","0921-8181","2007","79-86","Global and Planetary Change"

Although close in proximity, the two populations are topographically separated by an ice cap, which creates different climates and vegetation types in each region. Contaminant levels reflected the differing diets of the two caribou populations. To the south in the wetter lichen-rich region, caribou had significantly more aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium and zinc, likely due to atmospheric deposition on lichens. To the north in the dry desert steppe where grasses predominate, caribou had higher levels of copper. Cows collected in late winter had significantly less hepatic copper, lead and mercury if pregnant, indicating placental transfer of these elements. Our results suggest that hepatic copper levels <200μgg−1 dry weight may result in copper depletion in pregnant cows and hepatic mercury concentrations above 0.5μgg−1 dry weight may negatively affect fertility in caribou cows. Hepatic mercury levels were negatively correlated with cow body weight, suggesting an adverse effect on body condition.

In this paper, physically-based existing microplastics modeling studies are classified and reviewed according to the environment, modeling methodology, and input-output relationships. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of all modeling methodologies, it is deduced that more reliable results are obtained using hybrid methods, especially the coupling of hydrodynamic and process-based models, and hydrodynamics and statistical models. The significance of having much more consideration and knowledge on the microplastics' physical properties and the environmental processes affecting their fate and transport in the aquatic environments is revealed for future research.

Lightning data from TRMM satellite flash density data climatologies are taken and linearly fitted to convective precipitation climatologies. With the resulting linear model, lightning activity in 2010 is calculated based on the convective precipitation rate from model data. This approach combines the globally available satellite observations with the simplicity of linear convective rain parameterizations. It provides a new method for fitting lightning data for linear flash density parameterizations. Compared to other linear flash rate approaches or the very common cloud top height parameterization, the data for 2010 derived by the climatologies and actual 2010 precipitation data better matches the TRMM observation data. Lightning was found to be the second most important natural source after nitrogen monoxide emission from soil, with an annual average amount of 0.295 Tg N per year and an amount in 2010 of 0.278 Tg N. While it is less important for near-surface concentrations, it has a considerable effect on the nitrogen deposition in southern and eastern Europe and a large effect on the NO2 concentration in higher model layers. The effect in higher atmospheric layers over eastern Europe is 6 times larger than the effect of aircrafts on the air concentration of NO2 in the mid- and high altitudes.

The GMS granitoids are relatively low in silica, calc-alkaline, metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, and show characteristics of normal (oxidized) to reduced I-type granites depending on the properties of country rocks. They may have been derived from partial melting of lower crustal rocks triggered by underplated basaltic magmas; and country rocks bearing reduced organic carbon and/or graphite may have played an important role in the reduction of normal I-type intrusions to reduced I-type, which is essential in the formation of intrusion-related gold systems. In contrast, the GS granites, although calc-alkaline and metaluminous to peraluminous, are relatively rich in silica, incompatible elements, and high field strength elements. They are fractionated I-type granites, and are probably related to the coeval Mount Douglas granite in the Saint George batholith through fractional crystallization. Their parental magmas may have been derived from partial melting of quartzofeldspathic sources at relatively low temperatures. Both GMS and GS intrusions are orogenic, although some of them display the affinity of those emplaced into a within-plate environment. The origin of intrusion-related gold systems in this region appears to be controlled by several factors, including magma sources, magmatic processes, redox conditions (country-rock nature), and local structural regimes.","","article","","104","","","Geochemical characteristics of gold-related granitoids in southwestern New Brunswick, Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493708000182","0024-4937","2008","355-377","Lithos"

Data from 356 manufacturing companies in developing countries and regions, drawn from the sixth version of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey is used to examine the hypothesized model empirically. The findings indicate that the MPC activities effectively respond to SCU and act as an enabler of preventive and reactive SCRM.

Accident records show that most of the offshore blowouts have occurred in the drilling phase. Efficient measures to prevent, mitigate, and control offshore drilling blowouts are important for the entire offshore oil and gas industry. This article proposes a new barrier-based accident model for drilling blowouts. The model is based on the three-level well control theory, and primary and secondary well control barriers and an extra well monitoring barrier are established between the reservoir and the blowout event. The three barriers are illustrated in a graphical model that is similar to the well-known Swiss cheese model. Five additional barriers are established to mitigate and control the blowout accident, and event tree analysis is used to analyze the possible consequence chains. Based on statistical data and literature reviews, failures of each barrier are presented. These failures can be used as guidance for offshore drilling operators to become aware of the vulnerabilities of the safety barrier system, and to assess the risk related to these barriers. The Macondo accident is used as a case study to show how the new model can be used to understand the development of the events leading to the accident. The model can also be used as an aid to prevent future blowouts or to stop the escalation of events.","","article","","26","","","A safety barrier-based accident model for offshore drilling blowouts","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950423012001635","0950-4230","2013","164-171","Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries"

The evolution of the pockmarks after their formation was also investigated, together with the possibility that they are currently active features. The cores retrieved within the pockmarks lack a layer of ice-rafted debris and an overlying sequence of laminated glaciomarine sediments that were deposited on the undisturbed seafloor at the inception of the Bølling interstadial (~15calkyrBP). The pockmarks are suggested to have formed in that period, probably due to climate change-induced destabilisation of methane hydrates and the subsequent release of free gas. The depressions deepened as a result of reduced sedimentation above active seeps. The pockmark cores contain a series of gravel-rich layers, which are attributed to the winnowing of sediment during episodic fluid venting activity. The seismic images reveal little disturbance of the most ancient sediments underneath the pockmarks, indicating that the pockmark chimneys are localised features and were not imaged. The Holocene marine sediment cover in the pockmarks is thinner than on the surrounding seafloor, indicating relatively low sedimentation rates inside the depressions.

Experimental results demonstrate that the flexural modulus of the hybrid composites is strongly correlated with the location of carbon fiber plies; the closer these plies are to the laminate faces, the higher is the modulus. On the other hand, the flexural strength depends on the type and extent of damage initiation in the laminates. Interply hybridization of carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRPs) with glass fiber not only improves their flexural strength and failure strain but also facilitates failure predictability in CFRPs. The transverse and shear strains associated with various failure modes in thick hybrid laminates are efficiently captured by the DIC technique. In addition, AE results reveal that the strain levels associated with the onset of acoustic activity are linked to failure in the carbon fiber plies of the hybrid laminates. Furthermore, these observations made by DIC and AE on thick hybrid laminates are confirmed with optical fractography. Finally, it is revealed that ply lay-up sequence and laminate thickness notably alter both the mechanical performance and damage mechanisms of hybrid composites.","","article","","117","","","An experimental investigation on damage mechanisms of thick hybrid composite structures under flexural loading using multi-instrument measurements","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1270963821004314","1270-9638","2021","106921","Aerospace Science and Technology"

Of these, the Arctic sea ice regime has seen some of the most rapid change and is one of the most visible markers of Arctic change outside the scientific community. This has drawn considerable attention not only from the natural sciences, but increasingly, from the political and commercial sectors as they begin to grapple with the problems and opportunities that are being presented. The possible impacts of past and projected changes in Arctic sea ice, especially as it relates to climatic response, are of particular interest and have been the subject of increasing research activity. A review of the current knowledge of the role of sea ice in the climate system is therefore timely. We present a review that examines both the current state of understanding, as regards the impacts of sea-ice loss observed to date, and climate model projections, to highlight hypothesised future changes and impacts on storm tracks and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Within the broad climate-system perspective, the topics of storminess and large-scale variability will be specifically considered. We then consider larger-scale impacts on the climatic system by reviewing studies that have focused on the interaction between sea-ice extent and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Finally, an overview of the representation of these topics in the literature in the context of IPCC climate projections is presented. While most agree on the direction of Arctic sea-ice change, the rates amongst the various projections vary greatly. Similarly, the response of storm tracks and climate variability are uncertain, exacerbated possibly by the influence of other factors. A variety of scientific papers on the relationship between sea-ice changes and atmospheric variability have brought to light important aspects of this complex topic. Examples are an overall reduction in the number of Arctic winter storms, a northward shift of mid-latitude winter storms in the Pacific and a delayed negative NAO-like response in autumn/winter to a reduced Arctic sea-ice cover (at least in some months). This review paper discusses this research and the disagreements, bringing about a fresh perspective on this issue.","","article","","101","","","A review on Northern Hemisphere sea-ice, storminess and the North Atlantic Oscillation: Observations and projected changes","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809511001001","0169-8095","2011","809-834","Atmospheric Research"

These index glaciers are used to estimate annual mass balance and volume water equivalent changes for the over 3000 glaciers on the Southern Alps. Two methods are employed to monitor ice volume changes. Method I deals with the rapid to normal response time glaciers, which tend to be small to medium in size. It uses mass balance gradients and glacier areas to convert changes in snowlines to changes in ice volume water equivalent. Ice volume changes for the period 1976–2008 are calculated for each index glacier, and then extrapolated to most other glaciers of the Southern Alps, using the New Zealand glacier inventory. Method II deals with 12 protracted response glaciers, which tend to be large in size. These have been slow in reacting to a long-term regional warming trend. Instead they still largely retain the ablation areas of a century ago and are in a state of disequilibrium with the present climate. These valley glaciers have recently sustained substantial ice losses that are not able to be detected using Method I. Mass balance deficits and ablation from the 12 large protracted response glaciers are estimated using a geodetic approach based on topographic and lake changes determined from repeated surveys. Results show that estimated ice volume (in water equivalents) for the Southern Alps has decreased from 54.5km3 in 1976 to 46.1km3 by 2008. This equates to a rate of −0.3km3a−1 over the last three decades, but this is considerably less than the rate of ice volume loss estimated for the previous 100years. More than 3000 small and medium-size glaciers account for just 29% of the overall ice volume loss from the Southern Alps, while 71% of the loss occurs from the 12 large protracted response glaciers. Terminus calving contributes 0.8km3 and down-wasting of ice tongues in the ablation zone contributes 5.2km3. Some preliminary results show that ice volume changes are related to changes in circulation over the New Zealand region.","","article","","92-93","","","Annual ice volume changes 1976–2008 for the New Zealand Southern Alps","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818112000586","0921-8181","2012","105-118","Global and Planetary Change"

One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.","","article","","140","","","Lagrangian analysis of multi-satellite data in support of open ocean Marine Protected Area design","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064516304222","0967-0645","2017","212-221","Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography"

Pollen and charcoal data suggest that the Late Glacial landscape was dominated by a relatively fire-prone Larix forest-tundra during the Greenland Interstadial complex (GI 1) and a subarctic steppe during the Younger Dryas (GS1). The onset of the Holocene is marked by the reappearance of trees (mainly Alnus incana) within a fern and shrub dominated landscape. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) features shifting vegetational communities dominated by Alnus shrubs, diverse forb species, and locally abundant aquatic plants. The HTM is further defined by the first appearance of stone birch forests (Betula ermanii) – Kamchatka's most abundant modern tree species. The Late Holocene is marked by shifts in forest dynamics and forest-graminoid ratio and the appearance of new non-arboreal taxa such as bayberry (Myrica) and meadow rue (Filipendula). Kamchatka is one of Earth's most active volcanic regions. During the Late Glacial and Holocene, Kamchatka's volcanoes spread large quantities of tephra over the study region. Thirty-four tephra falls have been identified at the site. The events represented by most of these tephra falls have not left evidence of major impacts on the vegetation although some of the thicker tephras caused expansion of grasses (Poaceae) and, at least in one case, forest die-out and increased fire activity.","","article","","157","","","Late Glacial to Holocene paleoenvironmental change on the northwestern Pacific seaboard, Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379116306217","0277-3791","2017","14-28","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Previous studies have found that correct identification of these blooms remains a great challenge with the standard bio-optical algorithms applied to satellite ocean color data in optically complex coastal waters containing high concentrations of the interfered dissolved organic and particulate inorganic materials. Here a new method called the red tide index (RI) is presented which is capable of identifying potential areas of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from SeaWiFS ocean color measurements representing the typical Case-2 water environments off the Korean and Chinese coasts. The RI method employs the water-leaving radiances (Lw), collected from in-situ radiometric measurements of three SeaWiFS bands centered at 443 nm, 510 nm and 555 nm, to achieve derivation of indices that are then related to absorbing characteristics of harmful algae (i.e., Lw at 443 nm) from which a best fit with a cubic polynomial function with correlation coefficient of R2=0.91 is obtained providing indices of higher ranges for HABs and lower and slightly reduced ranges for turbid and non-bloom waters. Similar indices derived from the use of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) and combination of both are found rather inadequate to characterize the variability of the encountered bloom. In order to quantify the HABs in terms of chlorophyll (Chl), an empirical relationship is established between the RI and in-situ Chl in surface waters from about 0.4–71 mg m−3, which yields a Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm (RCA) based on an exponential function with correlation coefficient R2=0.92. The established methods were extensively tested and compared with the performances of standard Ocean Chlorophyll 4 (OC4) algorithm and Local Chlorophyll Algorithm (LCA) using SeaWiFS images collected from typical red tide waters of Korean South Sea (KSS), East China Sea (ECS), Yellow Sea (YS) and Bohai Sea (BS) during 1999–2002. The standard spectral ratio algorithms, the OC4 and LCA, yielded large errors in Chl retrievals for coastal areas, besides providing false information about the encountered HABs in KSS, ECS, YS and BS waters. On the contrary, the RI coupled with the standard spectral ratios yielded comprehensive information about various ranges of algal blooms, while RCA Chl showing a good agreement with in-situ data led to enhanced understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the recent HAB occurrences in high scattering and absorbing waters off the Korean and Chinese coasts.","","article","","103","","","Detecting the red tide algal blooms from satellite ocean color observations in optically complex Northeast-Asia Coastal waters","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425706001568","0034-4257","2006","419-437","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Trade wind activity is correlated with this gradient and drives surface oceanic water westward to produce the South Equatorial Current, which constitutes the northern part of a vast anticyclonic gyre in the South Pacific. High evaporation from the centre of the anticyclonic high results in the formation of hypersaline surface water, the Southern Tropical Water, which is dense enough to sink. This downwelling process removes plankton and particles from the euphotic zone and contributes to the strong oligotrophy of the gyre. Thermohaline pattern underlines the crucial role of vertical mixing processes in the upper mixed layer, which is isolated from the deeper Antarctic Intermediate Water by a stable pycnocline. Oceanic circulation measured in the band 140–145°W between latitudes 8–28°S during six HYDROPOL cruises (1986–1989) showed a weak (5–10 cm s−1) shallow (0–300 m) westward flow, South Equatorial Current, that was often dissected by small eastward countercurrents. The eastward component was increased considerably during the ENSO event of 1987 indicating an aperiodic forcing superimposed on the dynamic instability of the zone. Data gathered in the vicinity of barrier and atoll reefs showed that oceanic conditions (that is oligotrophic mixed layer) prevailed around these structures in spite of periodic thermal oscillations related to the tide regime. The Polynesian oceanic province being mainly in low dynamical conditions, vortex and eddies created around islands are insufficient to modify the vertical stratification or to pump up nutrients from the nutricline, that explains the absence of local upwelling or ‘island mass effect’. The permanence of a clear oligotrophic, euphotic layer then allows coral and reef communities to thrive and reach the atoll stage.","","article","","29","","","The Polynesian south ocean: Features and circulation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0025326X94904219","0025-326X","1994","14-25","Marine Pollution Bulletin"

The paper focuses on methodological developments and data collection over the last decade or so, including research associated with the continent-scale network of instrumented permafrost boreholes established between 1998 and 2001 under the European Union PACE project. Data indicate recent warming trends, with greatest warming at higher latitudes. Equally important are the impacts of shorter-term extreme climatic events, most immediately reflected in changes in active layer thickness. A large number of complex variables, including altitude, topography, insolation and snow distribution, determine permafrost temperatures. The development of regionally calibrated empirical-statistical models, and physically based process-oriented models, is described, and it is shown that, though more complex and data dependent, process-oriented approaches are better suited to estimating transient effects of climate change in complex mountain topography. Mapping and characterisation of permafrost depth and distribution requires integrated multiple geophysical approaches and recent advances are discussed. We report on recent research into ground ice formation, including ice segregation within bedrock and vein ice formation within ice wedge systems. The potential impacts of climate change on rock weathering, permafrost creep, landslides, rock falls, debris flows and slow mass movements are also discussed. Recent engineering responses to the potentially damaging effects of climate warming are outlined, and risk assessment strategies to minimise geological hazards are described. We conclude that forecasting changes in hazard occurrence, magnitude and frequency is likely to depend on process-based modelling, demanding improved understanding of geomorphological process-response systems and their impacts on human activity.","","article","","92","","","Permafrost and climate in Europe: Monitoring and modelling thermal, geomorphological and geotechnical responses","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825208001311","0012-8252","2009","117-171","Earth-Science Reviews"

The basic idea behind those applications is that an encounter of two or more ships can be considered safe if neither of ship domains is intruded by other ships. Research utilising this approach has been documented in numerous works, including publications on optimising collision avoidance manoeuvres performed to fulfil domain-based safety conditions. However, up to this point there has been no method, which would apply ship's domain to determine the last moment when a particular collision avoidance manoeuvre can still be successfully performed. This issue is addressed here. The proposed method uses a model of ship's dynamics to assess the time and distance necessary for a manoeuvre resulting in avoiding domain violations in give-way situations. The model and the method are described in detail and illustrated in a series of simulation results. The simulations cover full spectrum of typical give-way encounters in various circumstances: head-on, crossing and overtaking situations; manoeuvres limited to course alteration and those combining turns with speed reduction; open or confined waters and finally – in good and restricted visibility.","","article","","165","","","Ship domain applied to determining distances for collision avoidance manoeuvres in give-way situations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801818313222","0029-8018","2018","43-54","Ocean Engineering"

Three of the surfactants used were ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers in which the propylene oxide (PO) block was of constant length but the ethylene oxide (EO) block lengths were varied. Steady state extraction values — for PAH removal — were obtained after 50 hours for four of the five surfactants. The extraction efficiency — calculated as the fraction of PAH removed in one washing — is shown to be related to the EOPO ratio for the block copolymers. Apparent soil/aqueous surfactant solution distribution coefficients (Kd) were also obtained and suggest that the surfactants can reduce Kd by several orders of magnitude. Finally the kinetic data is readily fitted to the Elovich equation an essentially empirical equation which has been used, previously, to fit phosphate adsorption data.","","article","","38","","","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon extraction from a coal tar-contaminated soil using aqueous solutions of nonionic surfactants","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653598005153","0045-6535","1999","3095-3107","Chemosphere"

First, a PC index (PCI) is defined as remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr−1) at 620nm normalized against a baseline formed linearly between Rrs(560) and Rrs(665). Because PC has a local absorption peak at ~620nm, PCI is shown in both theory and model simulations to exhibit a monotonic functional relationship with PC concentration. Field measurements also support this hypothesis, from which an empirical algorithm is developed to estimate PC concentrations between ~1 and 300μg/L with unbiased RMS uncertainties of 58%. Radiative transfer simulations further show that such a field-based algorithm can be applied directly to MERIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) after adjusting algorithm coefficients. Spectral analyses and image comparisons indicate that such an algorithm is nearly immune to perturbations from thick aerosols, thin clouds, significant sun glint, and extreme water turbidity. Mean usable data coverage increases from <1% to >50% when using Rrc as compared to Rrs processed using standard atmospheric correction algorithms in SeaDAS. The robust algorithm performance and significantly improved data coverage lead to the establishment of a long-term (2002–2012) time-series of PC concentrations in Taihu Lake, which show both seasonal and inter-annual changes. Test of the algorithm over other lakes, including Dianchi Lake (a typical plateau lake of China), suggests that the same band-subtraction approach might be applicable to other inland water bodies, although local bio-optical conditions due to different sediment and phytoplankton compositions need to be considered when applying such an empirical approach.","","article","","154","","","A novel MERIS algorithm to derive cyanobacterial phycocyanin pigment concentrations in a eutrophic lake: Theoretical basis and practical considerations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442571400323X","0034-4257","2014","298-317","Remote Sensing of Environment"

If the high values of Zr–Ti represent a new source of silica (sand) the trend from low to high content suggests that a significant amount of low Zr–Ti glass was recycled to form these glass objects. Similar high Ti content can be seen in analysis results reported for other but not all 4–5th century samples found in northern Europe while earlier productions show typical low Ti contents. Although the fusing agent for these glasses seems to have always been natron (a mineral deposit in the Nile delta) from Hellenistic times to the 9th century, a change in the silica source, indicated by variation of the Ti and Zr content, could very well reflect the results of political instability of the 4–5th century exemplified by the fragmentation of the Roman Empire into two parts.","","article","","58","","","Change in silica sources in Roman and post-Roman glass","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0584854702002872","0584-8547","2003","659-667","Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy"

A monthly variation was observed, with higher concentrations in cold months (40–60 μg m−3) and lower levels in the warm season (13–17 μg m−3). A diurnal pattern was found in urban and suburban areas. The upward trend in NO2 observed during the whole period contrasts with the upward trend reported in 2013–2017. The NO2 tropospheric column levels measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument over the Iberian Peninsula indicated a similar behaviour; nevertheless, the largest Spanish metropolitan areas did not show this increase. The mean sea level pressure and wind field data of ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) were used to investigate the weather conditions, the NO2 outputs of the Copernicus Monitoring Services being used for the assessment of the NO2 spatial distribution. NO2 regional events, with concentrations in the range 140–150 μg m−3, and which occurred both in the winter and summer season under anticyclonic conditions, are also described. A local origin is identified in winter, whereas in summer, they are associated with a high-pressure system that blocks Mediterranean outflows towards the Atlantic Ocean. The high NO2 levels are attributed mainly to two factors: i) local emissions, rather than contributions from the western Mediterranean (or even North Africa), and ii) an increase in the pressure gradient between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean pressure systems, associated with a decrease in wind speed, was found during the last five years compared with the previous eight. Meteorological and chemical changes in mid-latitudes associated with global warming should also be investigated in the future.","","article","","693","","","Recent increase in NO2 levels in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719335120","0048-9697","2019","133587","Science of The Total Environment"

Although wildfires are some of the most important ecological processes in forest ecosystems, large-scale wildfires are often perceived as an environmental disaster. Since failure to include the dynamic nature of ecosystems in planning will inevitably lead to unexpected outcomes, we need to enhance our ability to cope with future extreme events coupled with climate change. This study presents several future scenarios in three different time periods for Canada’s Columbia Montane Cordillera Ecoprovince, which is prone to wildfires. These scenarios predict the probability of occurrence of widespread wildfires based on the hierarchical Bayesian model. The model was based on the relationships between wildfires and the Monthly Drought Code (MDC). The MDC is a generalized monthly version of the Daily Drought Code widely used across Canada by forest fire management agencies for monitoring of wildfire risk. To calculate future MDC values, we relied on different possible future conditions of climate, given by the Global Circulation Models. We found a regime shift in drought intensity with abrupt decreases in lightning-caused wildfire activity around 1940, suggesting that future wildfire risks can be inferred primarily from the summer drought code. For future periods, we found increasing trends in the probabilities of large-scale fires with time in most areas. It should be notable that, by the 2080s, there is a probability of some areas having more than 50% of large-scale wildfires under the “average” climatic conditions in the future, indicating that, even without “extreme” weather conditions, some ecosystems will have a fundamental probability of experiencing catastrophic fires under the condition of average summer. However, the rate of progression toward a fire-prone condition is quite different among the three climate change scenarios and among the region analyzed. Given such scenario-sensitive, spatially-heterogeneous patterns of wildfire probability in response to climate variability, management strategy should be flexible and more localized. By drawing on this knowledge, it may be possible to mitigate climate change impacts both before they arise and once they have occurred. These considerations are critical for maintaining the integrity of systems shaped by large-scale natural disturbances to increase their resilience to the changing climate while protecting human society and infrastructures. Working with alternative scenarios will facilitate our adaptation to climate change in managing fire-prone forest ecosystems.","","article","","310","","","Assessing possible shifts in wildfire regimes under a changing climate in mountainous landscapes","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112713006506","0378-1127","2013","875-886","Forest Ecology and Management"

Using NO2 observations at three ground stations representing urban, suburban, and rural environments, and tropospheric vertical column densities measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over each site, we show that the observations from space represent monthly averaged ground-level pollutant conditions well (R=0.86) under relatively cloud-free conditions. However, by analyzing the ground-level data and applying the OMI cloud fraction as a filter, we show there is a significant bias in long-term averaged NO2 as a result of removing the data during cloudy conditions. For the ground-based sites considered in this study, excluding observations on days when OMI-derived cloud fractions were greater than 0.2 causes 12:00–14:00 mean summer mixing ratios to be underestimated by 12%±6%, 20%±7%, and 40%±10% on average (±1standard deviation) at the urban, suburban, and rural sites respectively. This bias was investigated in particular at the rural site, a region where pollutant transport is the main source of NO2, and where long-term observations of NOy were also available. Evidence of changing photochemical conditions and a correlation between clear skies and the transport of cleaner air masses play key roles in explaining the bias. The magnitude of a bias is expected to vary from site to site depending on meteorology and proximity to NOx sources, and decreases when longer averaging times of ground station data (e.g. 24-h) are used for the comparison.","","article","","124","","","Biases in long-term NO2 averages inferred from satellite observations due to cloud selection criteria","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425712002118","0034-4257","2012","210-216","Remote Sensing of Environment"

This paper evaluates the applicational possibilities of hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements of inclusion-hosted water and its host calcite, in three different approaches: i) direct determination of calcite-water oxygen isotope fractionation by measuring inclusion water and carbonate compositions, ii) calculation of water oxygen isotope composition from hydrogen isotope data and of temperature from the inferred calcite-water fractionation, and iii) calculation of formation temperature from measured hydrogen isotope data and its temperature dependence in the modern precipitation water. Fluid inclusion oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions as well as calcite oxygen isotope compositions were determined for five speleothem occurrences in Hungary. Although the background processes are not resolved, calculations involving measured calcite and water oxygen isotope compositions yielded unrealistic paleotemperatures, likely because of syn-formation isotope fractionation processes and diagenetic alterations. The hydrogen isotope data may yield realistic temperatures, provided that long-term isotopic composition - temperature relationships are known and the stable hydrogen isotope composition of the precipitation waters in the study area is temperature-controlled. Winter half-year and annual isotope-temperature relationships (δ2H/T gradients) were calculated using multidecadal isotope composition records from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), gridded surface temperatures, and precipitation amounts from the E-OBS 21.0e database. The calculations yielded a paleotemperature record for the last ~250 ka, with average precisions ranging from ±0.6 °C for interglacial to ±2.4 °C for glacial periods. Clumped isotope analyses of cave-hosted flowstones support the inferred formation temperatures based on gradients, while detection of kinetic fractionations by combined hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of calcite and inclusion water lead to filtering clumped isotope (Δ47) data and more coherent Δ47-temperature relationships.","","article","","563","","","Paleotemperature reconstructions using speleothem fluid inclusion analyses from Hungary","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254120305908","0009-2541","2021","120051","Chemical Geology"

In mountain areas where snow avalanches are less scientifically documented, the dendrogeomorphological approach is the best way for snow–avalanche activity reconstruction and to investigate the magnitude and frequency of the avalanches. Our study was conducted in the Bucegi Mountains located in the eastern part of the Southern Carpathians (Romanian Carpathians) in the Sinaia ski area, the most important ski area in the Romanian Carpathians. The mountains are characterised by high elevations of over 2400–2500m, a harsh climate (−2.5°C mean annual air temperature above 2500masl, over 130days with snowfall on average, over 185days with deep snow on average and 10–12months with a snow layer). Snow avalanche activity is marked by tilted trunks, scars and broken trees. Therefore, we applied the dendrogeomorphological approach. We performed a dendrogeomorphic analysis based on 66 Picea abies and 48 Larix decidua Mill. We sampled trees in two snow avalanche tracks, 43 in one and 71 in the other, and obtained 86 and 142 samples, respectively. Our results from tree-ring records yielded 32 snow avalanche winters in the 1963–2011 chronology in one track and 27 snow avalanche winters in the 1963–2012 chronology in the other track. Thus, we obtained important information about the spatial and temporal characteristics of snow avalanche activity. The small and medium snow avalanches cover the central and lateral parts of the stands, whilst the large snow avalanches reach the runout zone of the stands. We dated past snow avalanches and obtained a return period ranging from 13.7 to 15.2years. The analysis revealed that 14 winters had an activity index over 10% 4 winters had an activity index over 20% in the first avalanche track, 10 winters had an activity index over 10% and 4 winters had an activity index over 20% in the second avalanche track. On the other hand, to determine the relationship between snow avalanches and winter temperatures we use the Winter Standardized Index (WSI) between 1963 and 2012. We obtained a correlation between these parameters and our dendrogeomorphological results; the probability of major snow avalanche occurrence was highest during cold winters.","","article","","104-105","","","Spatio-temporal reconstruction of snow avalanche activity using dendrogeomorphological approach in Bucegi Mountains Romanian Carpathians","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165232X14000834","0165-232X","2014","63-75","Cold Regions Science and Technology"

Individuals with WMS present with short stature, joint contractures, thick skin, microspherophakia, small and dislocated lenses, and cardiac valve anomalies. WMS can be caused by recessive mutations in ADAMTS10 (WMS 1), ADAMTS17 (WMS 4), or LTBP2 (WMS 3), or by dominant mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) (WMS 2); all genes encode secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Individuals with WMS 4 due to ADAMTS17 mutations appear to have less severe cardiac involvement and present predominantly with the musculoskeletal and ocular features of WMS. ADAMTS17 is a member of the ADAMTS family of secreted proteases and directly binds to fibrillins. Here we report a novel pathogenic variant in ADAMTS17 that causes WMS 4 in an individual with short stature, brachydactyly, and small, spherical, and dislocated lenses. We provide biochemical and cell biological insights in the pathomechanisms of WMS 4, which also suggest potential biological functions for ADAMTS17. We show that the variant in ADAMTS17 prevents its secretion and we found intracellular accumulation of fibrillin-1 and collagen type I in patient-derived skin fibroblasts. In accordance, transmission electron microscopy revealed elastic fiber abnormalities, decreased collagen fibril diameters, and intracellular collagen accumulation in the dermis of the proband.

Among them, acoustical measurement methods are the most widely used in practical applications. Hence, some typical acoustical measurement methods are introduced with more details, from their principles to application examples. Electrical and electromagnetic methods are also widely adopted and more traditional methods in geological exploration and subsurface structure detection are described. Several routine approaches and their applications are exhibited, too. While, in practical applications, how to sense the “waves” in rugged measurement environment is another important issue. Due to the presence of many extra benefits in “waves” sensing compared to traditional methods, optical sensing techniques are summarized and introduced with their application examples. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technology for detecting, locating, and inspecting objects or structures buried underneath ground surface. It is also applicable to detect objects behind walls or other dielectric barriers. In this chapter, the operating mechanism of GPR is explained. Moreover, the GPR circuit design, signal processing, and applications are presented.","","incollection","Academic Press","","Underground Sensing","978-0-12-803139-1","Chapter 2 - Acoustic, Electromagnetic and Optical Sensing and Monitoring Methods","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128031391000023","","2018","43-139",""

Ship performance degrades over time due to hull and propeller fouling; therefore assessing when fouling effects are significant enough to warrant cleaning is critical. Advancements in onboard data logging systems, combined with machine learning techniques, unlock the potential to predict fouling effects accurately and determine when to clean. This study evaluates five models for shaft power prediction: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree (AdaBoost), K – Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest. The importance of pre-processing is highlighted, contributing to the creation of a model with lower errors than previous studies. The significance of environmental parameters was explored, with the novel integration of wave statistics to the operational dataset, and simulated power-speed curves created from predictions to identify performance deterioration due to fouling. The Random Forest model was most effective in predicting shaft power, with an error of 1.17%. The addition of ‘Days Since Clean’ and ‘Significant Wave Height’ increased prediction accuracy by 0.07% and 0.12% respectively. Simulated power-speed curves revealed a 5.2% increase in shaft power due to fouling.

This paper provides a review of system-specific drivers of low oxygen in a range of case studies representing marine systems in the open ocean, on continental shelves, in enclosed seas and in the coastal environment. Identification of similar and contrasting responses within and across system types and corresponding oxygen regimes is shown to be informative both in understanding and isolating key controlling processes and provides a sound basis for predicting change under anticipated future conditions. Case studies were selected to achieve a balance in system diversity and global coverage. Each case study describes system attributes, including the present-day oxygen environment and known trends in oxygen concentrations over time. Central to each case study is the identification of the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine oxygen concentrations through the tradeoff between ventilation and respiration. Spatial distributions of oxygen and time series of oxygen data provide the opportunity to identify trends in oxygen availability and have allowed various drivers of low oxygen to be distinguished through correlative and causative relationships. Deoxygenation results from a complex interplay of hydrographic and biogeochemical processes and the superposition of these processes, some additive and others subtractive, makes attribution to any particular driver challenging. System-specific models are therefore required to achieve a quantitative understanding of these processes and of the feedbacks between processes at varying scales.","","article","","197","","","System controls of coastal and open ocean oxygen depletion","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661121001002","0079-6611","2021","102613","Progress in Oceanography"

All three sensors maintain good coherence within a summer season and can be used to create summer displacement products. Stacking is advantageous for the TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data sets, although mottling, possibly an interaction of the SAR with vegetation, or residual tropospheric noise, is visible, reducing the reliability of the results. RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-PALSAR provide the most promising results with the ability to form one year interval interferograms. PALSAR can also form two and three year interval interferograms. Long interval data sets spanning 2007 to 2010 identify a band of movement of 20 to 30cm/year along the north-east coast, and a region of movement of up to 5cm/year near the northern tip of the island. The ability to form long interval displacement products holds the most promise for permafrost monitoring, since long-term trends are of greater interest for permafrost stability than short-term seasonal changes. TerraSAR-X data have the disadvantage that year to year interferograms cannot be formed. InSAR is not the ideal monitoring technique for the large thaw slumps of Herschel Island. Although general areas of instability can be identified, specific slump detection is limited by radar look direction, and the large and abrupt slump movement, often accompanied by disintegration and collapse of slump sections, causes loss of coherence in the InSAR data. Thaw slumps may require a different interferometric approach, such as slump extent mapping from coherence loss, or the installation of corner reflectors and point target techniques. The frequent revisit and high spatial resolution of TerraSAR-X provide the best chance of maintaining coherence over thaw slumps. In general, InSAR is more successful at identifying broad areas of subtle subsidence in gentle relief, areas of terrain instability, possibly due to permafrost thaw or ground ice melt and the removal of water volume, and prior to significant slumping.","","article","","115","","","A comparison of TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-PALSAR interferometry for monitoring permafrost environments, case study from Herschel Island, Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425711003142","0034-4257","2011","3491-3506","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Localities were selected along the Nicaraguan coastline in the rainy and dry seasons during 2012–2013: A. tuberculosa and L. grandis were collected in the Pacific, and P. arctata in the Caribbean. The tissue concentration of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were integrated into pollution indices (chemical pollution index -CPI- and pollution load index -PLI-) and biological endpoints (flesh-condition, reproduction, histopathology and stress-on-stress) were determined as biomarkers of ecosystem health disturbance. In the Caribbean, contaminant tissue concentration was low in P. arctata, with some exceptions. Ag, As, Cd, Hg, Ni and V were mainly recorded during dry season, and PAHs and POPs (HCHs, DDTs, AHTN, PCBs and BDE85) during rainy season. Metals and PAHs were not a major threat in the study area; in contrast, high levels of HCHs and DDTs and low-to-moderate levels of musk fragrances and PBDEs were recorded. Minor differences were found in biological parameters albeit during the rainy season the LT50 values were low and seemingly associated to high PLI and CPI values. In the Pacific, the main pollutants recorded in A. tuberculosa and L. grandis were HCHs, DDTs, AHTN and PDBEs in rainy season and Cd in dry season. Although basic research is needed to understand the general biology, ecology and diseases in these Pacific species, biological endpoints comparable to those used in other sentinel bivalves are seemingly suitable biomarkers of health disturbance. Overall, Caribbean P. arctata and Pacific A. tuberculosa and L. grandis seem to be potential target species for pollution monitoring and ecosystem health disturbance assessment in mangrove–lined Nicaraguan coastal systems.

Our approach relies on readily available data on reported fish landings. We focus on bottom trawling, the world’s most widely used fishing method. We exploit the fact that using illegally small mesh size increases the share of small fish in the catch. Using quasi-random variation in nautical patrol as a source of variation in the incentive to comply, we show that in weeks without patrol the share of small fish in the landed catch is systematically larger than in adjacent weeks with patrol. Our results are in line with widespread use of illegally small mesh. The resulting catch and discard of juvenile fish is many times larger than the gain in the catch of marketable fish.

In addition, there could be unidentified hazards and unknown risks that escape even the most rigorous safety analysis process. Since a “bad day” can never be totally engineered away, there is a need to increase the probability of crew survival when things go wrong.

Record periods of observational data used in practice at sites of interest are often very short, often ranging from a few months to a few years. Predictions based on such small record periods are likely to be biased as it is recognized that wind speed is subject to important interannual variability and long-term trends. Large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns have an important influence on wind speed. Their predictable nature can make them useful for the prediction of wind speed during the lifetime of wind farm projects. This feature is not exploited in practice. It is proposed in this study to introduce predictors of the wind speed in non-stationary statistical models. This approach allows the development of predictions of the wind speed distribution conditionally on the state of the predictors. The predictors used here are indices of atmospheric circulation to account for the interannual variability and a temporal index to account for the long-term temporal trend. The proposed approach was applied to hourly wind speed data at selected meteorological stations in the province of Québec (Canada). 20 stations with long record periods of over 30 years of data were used. The most important circulation indices identified in the study area are the North-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during the winter season and the Pacific North American (PNA) during the spring season. Results indicate that the annual goodness-of-fit at the stations of the case study improved on average when the non-stationary model is used compared to the stationary model. The proposed approach can potentially be used to model wind speed during the projected lifetime of wind farms using forecasts of the predictors.","","article","","236","","","Non-stationary statistical modelling of wind speed: A case study in eastern Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890421002041","0196-8904","2021","114028","Energy Conversion and Management"

The historical record and a major earthquake in 1925 characterize this zone as the likely site of a future damaging earthquake (i.e. M = 5.5 or larger) and the aim of the monitoring was to develop the capability of predicting such earthquakes. The parameters studied included: microseismicity, seismic travel times, electrical impedance, vertical movement, horizontal movement, tilt, gravity change, and strain through water well level changes. Although no clear precursor was detected in the months before the largest seismic event that occurred during the observation period (M = 5.0), the multiparameter experiment provided new insights into the structure and the mechanics of this active region. Observations of several hundred well-located microearthquakes have permitted the delineation of ancient rift faults that are now being activated by high horizontal compression. The geographical extent of the zone is sharply defined by the microseismicity which occurs in an area of 35 km × 80 km straddling the St. Lawrence River. Observation of P-waves from accurately-timed explosions and S-waves from earthquakes support the hypothesis of Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy (EDA) involving saturated parallel cracks in the crust. The data have permitted an estimate of both crack density and the direction for the principal compressive stress in the region (N 30° E). Changes in electrical parameters with periods of months to years were detected at five of the six magnetotelluric stations installed in the region. Changes in the polarization angle of the earth's electrical (telluric) field correlated well (for seven years) with calculated groundwater accumulation levels at one site. Electric impedance changes showed no clear correlation from station to station, but changes at one station appear to correlate with a seismic P-wave travel time change anomaly and with the disappearance of a negative gravity anomaly at the time of an unusual number of earthquakes in the range M = 2 to 3 from mid 1976 to mid 1977. It is suggested that these correlated changes could be related to aseismic stress redistribution and fluid flow along one of the NE striking rift faults about two years before theM = 5.0 earthquake in 1979. Continuous monitoring of tilt (surface and borehole) and well-water levels was carried out at a single site (Charlevoix Geophysical Observatory). Although there were unexplained near-surface tilts of the order of the earth tide amplitude within two or three days before some earthquakes, they were either not spatially coherent or were related to small unexplained temperature changes in the tiltmeter vault. No intermediate-term (one week to one year) precursors were seen against a noise level of 1–3 μrad (RMS) for near-surface tilt observations and a noise level of 0.2–0.3 μrad (RMS) for borehole tilt measurements at a depth of 50–100 m. The threshold of detectable tidal tilt admittance changes for the borehole tiltmeters was lowered to 2% but no significant changes were seen. Four coseismic changes in the levels of water in boreholes were observed (all were drops in water level) which were much larger than expected on the basis of elastic dislocation theory. It is suggested that these could be explained either by the collapse of a dilatant zone around the respective hypocentres or by triggered aseisnuc movement on a nearby active fault. Borehole water level tides observed from 1980 to 1986 exhibit significant variations in amplitude and phase which are thought to be the result of time-varying elastic properties in a nearby structure. Some constraints can now be placed on the long-term deformation of the CSZ as a whole from tiltmeter, levelling and horizontal surveys. Data from a levelling array observed from 1976 to 1986 puts a limit of 0.54 μ rad/yr on the secular tilt rate at the observatory: a further limit of 0.1 μ rad/yr is provided by borehole tilt measurements over the period 1983–1986. A limit of 2 cm is placed on vertical movements northwest of the St. Lawrence River by levelling surveys in 1965, 1978, 1980 and 1982. No significant (90% confidence) deviatoric strain has been detected across the CSZ from horizontal control surveys carried out in 1912–1919, 1965, 1978 and 1983: the maximum allowable long-term strain rate across the CSZ from 1919 to 1983 is 0.16 μ strain/yr.","","article","","156","","","Twelve years of geophysical research in the Charlevoix seismic zone","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195188900601","0040-1951","1988","193-224","Tectonophysics"

We attempted to investigate correlations between the concentration of selected heavy metals and the MS from 41 sample sites around Izmit Gulf. These investigations let us quantify and standardize the MS method, which may have consequences for long term monitoring of anthropogenic pollution, especially in urban areas. The MS surfer contour map based on the topsoil measurements was compiled with a randomly ranged distance density. The soil samples collected throughout the industrial areas, the parks, road sides and residential areas were also analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Heavy metals Cu, Ni, Cr and Pb show strong correlations with MS, while Zn and Co show a weak correlation with MS. Moreover, the Tomlinson pollution load index (PLI) shows insignificant correlation with the MS. The MS was examined vertically (0–30cm) with respect to anthropogenic and/or lithogenic influences at the fourteen sample sites. The maximum values were mostly observed in depths of 2–5cm and the MS values on the depth profiles vary between 10×10−8m3kg−1 and 203×10−8m3kg−1. The study revealed that MS is an inexpensive, fast and non-destructive method for the detection and mapping of contaminated soils.","","article","","70","","","Magnetic susceptibility and heavy-metal contamination in topsoils along the Izmit Gulf coastal area and IZAYTAS (Turkey)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985109001487","0926-9851","2010","46-57","Journal of Applied Geophysics"

Although GLIMS is making use of multiple remote-sensing systems, ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and reflection Radiometer) is optimized for many needed observations, including mapping of glacier boundaries and material facies, and tracking of surface dynamics, such as flow vector fields and supraglacial lake development. Software development by GLIMS is geared toward mapping clean-ice and debris-covered glaciers; terrain classification emphasizing snow, ice, water, and admixtures of ice with rock debris; multitemporal change analysis; visualization of images and derived data; and interpretation and archiving of derived data. A global glacier database has been designed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC, Boulder, Colorado); parameters are compatible with and expanded from those of the World Glacier Inventory (WGI). These technology efforts are summarized here, but will be presented in detail elsewhere. Our presentation here pertains to one broad question: How can ASTER and other satellite multispectral data be used to map, monitor, and characterize the state and dynamics of glaciers and to understand their responses to 20th and 21st century climate change? Our sampled results are not yet glaciologically or climatically representative. Our early results, while indicating complexity, are generally consistent with the glaciology community's conclusion that climate change is spurring glacier responses around the world (mainly retreat). Whether individual glaciers are advancing or retreating, the aggregate average of glacier change must be climatic in origin, as nonclimatic variations average out. We have discerned regional spatial patterns in glaciological response behavior; these patterns are best attributed to climate-change variability and to regional differences in glacier size and response times. In many cases, glacier length changes under-represent the magnitude of glacier ablation, because thinning (sometimes without immediate length changes) is also important. An expanded systematic, uniform analysis of many more glaciers is needed to isolate the glacier response components due to climatic and nonclimatic perturbations, to produce quantitative measures of regional variation in glacier changes, and to predict future regional glacier trends relevant to water resources, glaciological hazards, and global sea level. This comprehensive assessment (to be completed in stages) is expected to lend a critically needed filter to identify successful climate models that explain recent glacier changes and change patterns (and hence, are apt to describe future changes) and to eliminate unsuccessful models.","","article","","99","","","Multispectral imaging contributions to global land ice measurements from space","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425705002154","0034-4257","2005","187-219","Remote Sensing of Environment"

The common factor is the need for connectivity everywhere and every time at high performance and quality, while the services traffic profiles and the users’ behaviour can be drastically different. This need is fully satisfied by the recent 5G mobile networks, where the coexistence of heterogeneous applications with different Quality of Service (QoS) levels is possible, defining new vertical markets and cutting-edge applications. In this context, we propose a Flexible Web Traffic Generator (FWTG) tool to model the dynamics of recent applications and user interactions in a realistic way, allowing the generation of real-time HTTP traffic and the possibility to inject it into real networks. FTWG represents a valid in-laboratory solution for the rapid configuration and applications performance evaluation of network slices in the context of 5G Non-Public Networks (NPN), pursuing an effective emulation approach. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the evaluation of real traffic response to different network configurations (and vice-versa), using components, equipment and network functions of the target network under test. After the description of the rationale and the methodology for defining FWTG models and their implementation, we defined a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) generated by the tool (e.g., number of requested objects and size, request rate, throughput, etc.). Then, we present initial validation tests on a Linux-based testbed representing the 5G-based scenarios of interest, emulating also a satellite backhaul as representative of a use-case requiring cost-effective dimensioning. Numerical outcomes of running FWTG in different configurations are then provided, considering a variation of the number of users sharing the same resources, their composition and traffic type, showing with concrete examples the usefulness and flexibility of FWTG in supporting 5G network configuration optimizations. Definitively, the tool is released as Open Source software on Gitlab.","","article","","221","","","A Flexible Web Traffic Generator for the dimensioning of a 5G backhaul in NPN","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128622005655","1389-1286","2023","109531","Computer Networks"

We explore its associations with climate variability. Areas, sampling locations and trees were selected for representativeness rather than climate sensitivity. Using tree rings from 651 conifers from six widely dispersed areas we show strong intercorrelation between trees within each major conifer species within and between areas. Regional composite tree-ring series for spruce and pine contain a major fraction of decadal and multidecadal variability. The most likely driver of this common variability is interannual to multidecadal climate variability. Gridded monthly instrumental climate data for the period 1902–2008, particularly mean temperature and total precipitation, were tested as predictors of each local species-specific tree-ring site chronology. The most consistent pattern emerged for spruce at all but the southernmost area. Cool and moist summers the year before growth were consistent drivers of spruce ring growth throughout the period, with no change in recent decades. Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index for prior summer was also a strong and consistent driver of spruce ring growth. For pine, there was a weaker but similarly stable association between larger rings and warm, moist conditions, in this case in the current summer. These associations were also identified at multidecadal time scales, particularly for spruce. On the other hand, the specific role of moisture variability in determining interannual to multidecadal variability in tree growth in this high latitude region raises questions about the relative vulnerability of spruce and pine there under global warming.","","article","","56","","","Different climate responses of spruce and pine growth in Northern European Russia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S112578651930075X","1125-7865","2019","125601","Dendrochronologia"

Major, minor and trace element patterns of 169 well-dated samples from three rural Iberian sites (Congosto, Gózquez and El Pelícano) have brought to light major chronological developments in the production, circulation and use of glass between the fifth and the eighth century CE. The data identify four distinct compositional groups of Egyptian and Levantine origin. Egyptian Foy 2.1, Foy 2.1 high Fe and so-called Magby alongside Apollonia-type Levantine I were the main glass types of the Visigothic period. Due to the tight dating of the majority of the samples, we were able to reveal fundamental changes in the geographical scope of glass supplies to the Iberian Peninsula, and to refine the chronological range of the known primary production groups. The glass group commonly known as série 2.1 or Foy 2.1 started being produced already during the second half of the fifth century. The appearance of Foy 2.1 high Fe can likewise be moved forward to the first half of the sixth century. A plant-ash group referred to as Magby was introduced around the middle of the sixth century. Egypt was undeniably the main supplier of raw glasses to the Iberian Peninsula up to the mid-sixth century CE, after which the Levantine I group became the prime glass type among the analysed assemblages. In the final stages of the Visigothic Kingdom and the early years of Islamic dominion, there is a noticeable drop in the absolute quantity of glass available, together with an increase in recycling. The implications of these transformations in the supply of glass for the organisation of Mediterranean trade are discussed.","","article","","107","","","Changes in the supply of eastern Mediterranean glasses to Visigothic Spain","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440319300366","0305-4403","2019","23-31","Journal of Archaeological Science"

As these modes are a useful tool for simplifying the understanding of the climate system, it is crucial that we gain improved knowledge of their long-term past evolution and interactions over time to contextualise their present and future behaviour. We review the literature focused on proxy-based reconstructions of modes of climate variability during the Holocene (i.e., the last 11.7 thousand years) with a special emphasis on i) proxy-based reconstruction methods; ii) available proxy-based reconstructions of the main modes of variability, i.e., El Niño Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Variability, Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Southern Annular Mode and the Indian Ocean Dipole; iii) major interactions between these modes; and iv) external forcing mechanisms related to the evolution of these modes. This review shows that modes of variability can be reconstructed using proxy-based records from a wide range of natural archives, but these reconstructions are scarce beyond the last millennium, partly due to the lack of robust chronologies with reduced dating uncertainties, technical issues related to proxy calibration, and difficulty elucidating their stationary impact (or not) on regional climates over time. While for each mode the available reconstructions tend to agree at mutidecadal timescales, they show notable disagreement on shorter timescales beyond the instrumental period. The reviewed evidence suggests that the intrinsic variability of modes can be modulated by external forcing, such as orbital, solar, volcanic, and anthropogenic forcing. The review also highlights some modes experience higher variability over the instrumental period, which is partly ascribed to anthropogenic forcing. These features stress the paramount importance of further studying their past variations using long climate-proxy records for the progress of climate science.","","article","","209","","","Modes of climate variability: Synthesis and review of proxy-based reconstructions through the Holocene","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825220303329","0012-8252","2020","103286","Earth-Science Reviews"

This is in contrast to the Eastern Mediterranean Basin as a whole which is oligotrophic to ultraoligotrophic. Over recent years, due to increased pressure from anthropological activities, there has been a decline in the biological resources in the Gulf of Gabès. This has led scientists to focus their research on the different trophic levels of the food chain and in particular on phytoplankton. Studies dedicated to phytoplankton in the Gulf of Gabès have previously relied on conventional global approaches. This work on the other hand, examines ultraphytoplankton (<10µm) distribution at the single cell level in different water masses, during a summer cruise (2008). Three distinct water masses were identified: modified Mediterranean waters (MMW), modified Atlantic waters (MAW) and Ionian waters (IW). Despite the summer period, nutrients were abundant and non-limiting. Flow cytometry resolved five cell groups, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picoeukaryotes, nanoeukaryotes and a group of unidentified cells. These cells were characterised by low fluorescence signals and scatter signals larger than that of cyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes and thus were labelled LFNano for low fluorescence nanoeukaryotes. They were found in very high abundances, whereas the other usual groups were relatively low in abundance despite the favourable growth conditions. LFNano found during a 2012 summer cruise in the same area, were also sorted by flow cytometry and observed by scanning electron microscopy. Choanoflagellates were identified, and these nanoflagellates appear to account for the low abundance in the usual ultraphytoplankton group due to their efficient feeding/grazing mechanism. However, the most abundant LFNano could not be identified. Results strongly suggest a top-down control of the ecosystem, consistent with the high productivity of the Gulf that implies a rapid transfer of matter and energy to higher trophic levels.","","article","","93","","","The characterisation and summer distribution of ultraphytoplankton in the Gulf of Gabès (Eastern Mediterranean Sea, Tunisia) by using flow cytometry","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434314003136","0278-4343","2015","27-38","Continental Shelf Research"

Concentrations of some organotin compounds, i.e. tributyltin and triphenyltin with their di- and mono- substituted metabolites, were measured and endocrine disruption such as imposex (superimposition of male sexual characteristics on females of gonochoristic gastropods) was observed. Vas deferens sequence indexes (VDSI) of 4.1–4.9 were found in organisms from stations inside the lagoon, and 3.6–4.2 in the sea stations. Organotin derivatives were measured in both the visceral coil and the rest of the soft body of the organisms. Total concentrations of butyltin compounds ranged from 102±17 to 432±27 ng Sn g−1 d.w. in the visceral coil, and from 96±24 to 297±107 ng Sn g−1 d.w. in the rest of the soft body. Phenyltins were found at far lower concentrations, ranging from 8±1 to 41±3 ng Sn g−1 d.w. (visceral coil) and from 0.25 to 32±22 ng Sn g−1 d.w. (rest of soft body). The degree of imposex in female gastropods, evaluated from VDSI and penis lengths, was related to organotin contents in the soft body. In particular, female penis lengths were significantly correlated (r=0.917 and r=0.982, P<0.05) to tributyltin (TBT) contents and the sum of organotin compounds in organisms.","","article","","332","","","Concentrations of organotin compounds and imposex in the gastropod Hexaplex trunculus from the Lagoon of Venice","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969704002724","0048-9697","2004","89-100","Science of The Total Environment"

Basically, the collection of maps showing distribution of a set of elements with particular emphasis of possibly harmful elements (PHE) was focused on elucidation of environmental implications brought about by human impact (ingress of Pb, Zn, Cd and other elements derived from anthropogenic sources) against some zero-level represented by geochemical background. However, the effect of blending of anthropogenic and natural (geogene) signal in the upper soil was already recognized during the mapping campaign having steered further research to assessment of geological imprint in the soil geochemical signature. Therefore this work was also aimed at finding appropriate avenues to understanding how both signals behave at various scales (regional or local). Using suitable statistical techniques (posterior probabilities from discriminant function analysis (DFA)) it was found that anthropogenic signal may be completely obliterated by the geogenic geochemical signature at a larger, regional, scale, which is otherwise locally strong and adversely affects the environment (e.g. PHE with regard to the Drava River).","","article","","115","","","Geochemical Atlas of Croatia: Environmental implications and geodynamical thread","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375674212000404","0375-6742","2012","36-46","Journal of Geochemical Exploration"

The approach is illustrated using a flowline from the Chalk aquifer in Berkshire, UK where aerobic and anaerobic sections of the aquifer are separately considered. The baseline concentrations for some elements are close to atmospheric values whereas others evolve through time-dependent water–rock interaction. Certain solutes (K, NH4+), often considered contaminants, reach naturally high concentrations due to geochemical controls; transition metal concentrations are generally low, although their concentrations may be modified by redox controls.

The coastal region of the Chiloé Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ∼10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ∼7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years.

The results showed that Si addition significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence. However, Si did not reduce the amount of R. solanacearum in rhizosphere soil. Principal components analysis showed that soil microbial community composition was strongly influenced by Si addition. Total 63.7% bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 43.8% fungal OTUs were regulated by Si addition regardless of the presence of tomato plants, indicating the independent effects of Si on soil microbial community. Si-added soil harbored a lower abundance of Fusarium, Pseudomonas, and Faecalibacterium.

Efficient interaction and communication between these agents are crucial for safe operation. Conventional methods for hazard identification and safety assessment focus often on one of the aspects of the system only, e.g., human reliability, software failures, or equipment reliability. The method Human-System Interaction in Autonomy (H-SIA) was recently proposed, focusing on autonomous ships operation and collision scenarios. H-SIA provides a framework for analyzing autonomous ship operation as an entirety, rather than each agent separately. The method comprised initially of two main elements: An Event Sequence Diagram (ESD) and a Concurrent Task Analysis (CoTA). While the ESD models the events that can take place following an initiating event, the CoTA models which tasks the agents must perform for these events to succeed. This paper extends H-SIA to include the paths to failure, through the development of Fault Trees (FTs), which is necessary for risk analysis and identification of risk reduction measures. The FTs development of H-SIA introduces novelties in comparison to common FTs: (i) they model the system as whole, (ii) they are generic and can accommodate a diversity of systems designs; (iii) they lead to basic failure events. The FTs allows for identification of failure events arising through interaction between autonomous ship and human operators, as well as failure propagation through these agents. The basic failure events are applicable for different autonomous concepts. A case study on autonomous ship collision demonstrates the use of the extended method. The case study illustrates H-SIA’s applicability to different designs and levels of autonomy, its potential for identification of failure events, and its use in risk assessments.","","article","","129","","","A generic approach to analysing failures in human – System interaction in autonomy","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520302058","0925-7535","2020","104808","Safety Science"

As UV radiation is assumed to be the main risk factor for skin cancer, hourly values of the UV irradiance were reconstructed for the period 1957–2005 for 17 of the Norwegian counties (58–70°N). For reconstruction, a radiation transfer model is run with total ozone amount and cloud information as meteorological input. Reconstructed hourly erythemally weighted UV irradiances for about 5 years are compared to measurements at four stations, two stations representing the north–south extension of Norway, and two stations at about 60°N representing the eastern inland – Western coastal contrasts. The agreement between reconstructed and measured UV varies between 0% for the northernmost site to 10–15% overestimation for the other locations. For clear sky, a reasonable agreement between reconstructed and measured data was found for all stations, while for overcast, an overestimation of 10–20% was found for all but the northernmost station. Both the cancer incidences and the reconstructed UV values have a distinct north–south increase. The UV increase towards south is mostly due to increasing solar elevation. The west to east increase is much smaller, and differences in UV are due to differences in both cloud optical thickness and total cloud amount. One additional outcome from this work is that long-term UV-data are reconstructed for Norway, data that can be used in further biological and medical studies related to UV effects.","","article","","96","","","UV radiation and skin cancer in Norway","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1011134409001213","1011-1344","2009","232-241","Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology"

The full extent of pesticide contamination is not fully understood due to complex fate pathways in the subsurface. Groundwater pesticide occurrence was investigated at seven agricultural sites in different hydrogeological settings to identify where pesticide occurrence dominated in temperate maritime climatic conditions. In Ireland, six cereal dominated sites in the South East and one grassland site in the West were investigated. Soil and subsoils varied from acid brown earths with high permeability to clay and silt rich tills with lower permeability. Over a 2year monitoring period, 730 samples were collected from a network of dedicated wells and springs across the seven sites. Multi-nested piezometers were installed in intergranular, fissured and karstic type aquifers to target shallow, transition and deeper groundwaters. Several springs were also sampled and the network included a confined aquifer. Groundwater was analysed for nine pesticide active ingredients and eight metabolites. Mecoprop and 2,4-D were the most frequently detected active ingredients above the instrument detection limit, accounting for 36% and 26% of the 730 samples collected and analysed. Phenoxyacetic acid was the most frequently detected and widespread metabolite found in 39% of samples collected at all seven sites. Where the European Union drinking water standard of 0.1μg/L was exceeded, metabolites accounted for the majority of exceedances with 3,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (DBA) and phenoxyacetic acid (PAC) dominating. Highest detections were encountered in sites with well drained soils underlain by gravel and limestone aquifers and within gravel lenses in lower permeability subsoil. Across the seven sites pesticide detections were mostly associated with metabolites and the environmental impact of many of these is unknown as they have received little attention in groundwater previously.","","article","","601-602","","","Hydrogeological characteristics influencing the occurrence of pesticides and pesticide metabolites in groundwater across the Republic of Ireland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717311828","0048-9697","2017","594-602","Science of The Total Environment"

A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM+ TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of 222Rn (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale.

Yet, the locations of accidents are increasingly spread, and it is becoming difficult for road managers to set priorities for interventions on their road network. They can no longer base their strategy on accident analysis. Road managers need to quickly measure the effectiveness of a modified facility, improvement of facilities or modification of the environment. On this type of site accident analysis requires a period of 3 to 5 years to determine the effectiveness of a change. This period of time does not meet the requirements of road managers or road users. To provide a high safety level, managers are implementing innovative developments: wall effect chicane at crossroads, dynamic warning signs, rural roundabouts, etc. Managers want to quickly assess these innovations. In addition, they have less and less money, so it is necessary to give them tools to help prioritize their intervention. It is also preferable for road managers to take preventive action rather than having to wait for accidents or serious injuries to occur, in order to carry out diagnosis and propose countermeasures. In this article, we propose a new safety indicator based on trajectory analysis. By trajectory, we mean a time-function that describes vehicle movement including not only its path on the road but also speeds and accelerations in both horizontal directions (longitudinal and transverse). These trajectories describe vehicle/infrastructure/driver interactions and reveal inadequacies that can lead to accidents. These trajectories are obtained using two roadside observation systems that analyse vehicle trajectories on two specific locations: curves and intersections on rural roads. The first tool is a local trajectory measurement system. It records trajectories of all vehicles passing through a specific zone. The goal is to observe abnormal paths that reveal dysfunctions in the vehicle/Infrastructure/driver system. The main applications-related contribution of this work focuses on developing a comprehensive solution for accurately estimating vehicle trajectories based on a combination of video images and range finder (telemeter) measurements. The purpose of the second tool is to improve understanding of dysfunctions at a crossroads and to evaluate the effectiveness of facilities. A precise study of patterns encountered on accident-prone intersections on rural roads showed that some situations are much more dangerous and frequent than others. In particular, most accidents at intersections are caused by vehicles crossing main roads. The second system presented in this paper detects and records conflicts between users on the secondary road who are crossing the main road, and users driving straight ahead on the main road. This kind of conflict represents the main type of accidents called crossing at grade accidents. The proposed risk indicator is equal to the number of conflicts (near-misses), weighted by the severity of the conflicts recorded in a given period. We chose to take the number of conflicts per hour. The purpose of these tools is to understand anomalies in the vehicle/infrastructure/driver system, and to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on safety. Associated with risk indicators they make it possible to objectively assess driver behaviours with respect to the road infrastructure.","","article","","14","","","A New Road Safety Indicator Based on Vehicle Trajectory Analysis","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146516304045","2352-1465","2016","4267-4276","Transportation Research Procedia"

Existing moraine chronologies from the central Southern Alps indicate maximum ice extent was achieved during marine isotope stages 3–4, followed by repeated advances of similar, but gradually declining extent during marine isotope stage 2, until onset of the glacial termination. Questions remain over the precise role of climate in driving these changes, as most existing moraine chronologies come from large, complex former valley glacier systems, where non-climatic influences such as changing bed topography and proglacial lake formation may have influenced glacier length changes. Here we address this problem via a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology and equilibrium line altitude reconstruction from a cirque glacier situated in Fiordland, New Zealand. Our chronology shows moraine deposition at 32 ± 11 ka, 18.7 ± 0.2 ka, 18.1 ± 0.1 ka, and c. 17.2 ± 0.3 ka. The simple geometry of the former glacier supports the role of climate in driving a net decline of regional ice volume during marine isotope stages 3–2. Close spacing and good preservation of the 19–17 ka moraines permits 2D glacier reconstruction which suggests the equilibrium line altitude remained depressed by c.1130 m (equivalent to 5.8 ± 0.6 °C colder than present) during this interval. Onset of warming after 17.2 ± 0.2 ka is consistent with climate proxy evidence for a sustained southward shift in the southern westerly winds, which may have promoted deglaciation via shifting ocean currents and promoting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.","","article","","275","","","Climate reconstructions for the Last Glacial Maximum from a simple cirque glacier in Fiordland, New Zealand","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379121004881","0277-3791","2022","107281","Quaternary Science Reviews"

A significant regionally coherent temporal variability of the annual and semiannual constituents in sea level, air pressure, air temperature and the wind field is established. The decadal variability of the annual and semiannual constituents in sea level is found to be closely correlated with the variability in the mechanical atmospheric forcing. This indicates a non-steric contribution to the long-period variations of the seasonal cycle in coastal sea level. In all parameters considered, the largest changes compared to earlier times occurred in the last two decades. The variation found in air pressure indicates an increase of the difference between maritime and continental climate regions in Northern Europe. These variations may be linked to variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation on decadal time scales as well as a general warming trend.","","article","","20","","","Temporal variability of the seasonal sea-level cycle in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in relation to climate variability","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818198000691","0921-8181","1999","173-203","Global and Planetary Change"

Two contrasting sites, freely-draining (FD) versus seasonally-wet (SW), situated in mixed-livestock farms (Conwy, Wales, UK), were selected. We measured soil CO2 efflux associated with three field boundaries: hedgerow on SW soil; hedgerow on FD soil; stone wall (abiotic control) on FD soil, quantifying the influence of distance from field boundary and grazing occurrence (grazed pasture versus un-grazed zone adjacent to hedgerows) on annual C budgets based on soil CO2 flux and net primary productivity. For the FD site, the annual C budget showed that pasture was a net source of C emissions (11 ± 1.5 t CO2 ha−1 yr−1) and the un-grazed zone adjacent to the hedgerow a net sink (-0.9 ± 2.2 t CO2 ha−1 yr−1). For the SW site, pasture acted as a small net sink of C (-0.1 ± 1.3 t CO2 ha−1 yr−1) and the hedgerow zone a net source (5.8 ± 0.8 t CO2 ha−1 yr−1), due entirely to a spike in soil CO2 efflux associated with a relatively unusual summer drought. To investigate the effect of this observed summer drought on more typical (for the UK maritime climate) annual C source-sink dynamics, we modelled soil CO2 efflux for a summer-drought-excluded year for both FD and SW soils. With greater hedgerow cover (modelled prediction compared with a baseline of no hedgerows), annual CO2 flux became more negative (greater net sink) in fields on FD soil (by 1 t CO2 ha−1 yr−1 at 8% hedgerow cover), with drought limiting the effect size. In SW soils, greater hedgerow cover also led to a more negative annual CO2 flux (by 0.4 t CO2 ha−1 yr−1 at 8% hedgerow cover) when drought was excluded, but a more positive flux (net C source) with drought included (by 0.5 t CO2 ha−1 yr−1 at 8% hedgerow cover). This study illustrates the importance of the interaction between soil type and seasonal events such as drought on the ability of hedgerows to act as a net C sink.","","article","","382","","","Hedgerow effects on CO2 emissions are regulated by soil type and season: Implications for carbon flux dynamics in livestock-grazed pasture","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706119328940","0016-7061","2021","114697","Geoderma"

The region of Genoa has recently moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous flash floods of the Bisagno River and its tributaries as a result of intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011 and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects of the Bisagno River flash flood of October 9th, 2014 in the city of Genoa. Application of a Standard Anomaly Index and a Cluster Analysis reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded in the Bisagno Valley for the period of 1945–2016. Urban sprawl in the catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding Genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land use change, including in particular transformations of the Bisagno riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen observatory for early warning of flash floods.","","article","","98","","","Role of rainfall intensity and urban sprawl in the 2014 flash flood in Genoa City, Bisagno catchment (Liguria, Italy)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014362281730365X","0143-6228","2018","224-241","Applied Geography"

During the summer stratified season, there are usually cold patches around the tip of Peninsula. Using the satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data from 1999 to 2018, this study showed that there was a pod-like cold water patch with two cold centers around the tip of Liaodong Peninsula, China. The range and the intensity of upwelling indicated an increasing trend during 1999–2018. We used a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model Mike21 to study the impact of the tidal current to the intra-month variations of upwelling (DHI 2009). The variability of tidal currents brought the significant spring–neap variations of the upwelling, showing that the SST of upwelling during the spring tide was lower about 1°C and the range of the cold water extended farther than that during the neap tide. The variations of upwelling area lagged behind the tide range about 4 days. The mechanisms of long-term variations of the upwelling were analyzed using the remote sensing wind data and the reanalysis ocean current data. Summer surface wind in the Bohai Sea suppressed the upwelling through the inshore Ekman transports and the effect of the wind curls could be ignored. The dispersion of geostrophic current around the Laotieshan Channel due to the bottom friction could drive the upward vertical velocities. Both of wind and current contributed to the multi-year variations of the upwelling around the tip of Liaodong Peninsula, China.","","article","","55","","","The spring–neap variability and mechanisms of long-term variations in the upwelling at the tip of Liaodong Peninsula, China","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352485522002110","2352-4855","2022","102574","Regional Studies in Marine Science"

However, there exist two main problems in trajectory clustering: One is the inherent problem of the clustering algorithm, such as low computational efficiency, poor recognition of noise, sensitivity to the density distribution of data, etc.; the other problem is about the similarity measurement of the trajectories, that is, most of the measurement methods ignore the overall motion trend or local features of ship trajectories. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes the FOLFST, a novel ship trajectory clustering method for Finding Overall and Local Features of Ship Trajectories, which consists of four parts: 1) segment the trajectory with the ADP (Adaptive-threshold Douglas-Peucker) algorithm; 2) adopt new sub-trajectory segments similarity measurement method which considers both the wholeness and locality of the trajectory; 3) cluster the sub-trajectory segments with the improved FOP-OPTICS (Finding of the Ordering Peaks Based on OPTICS); 4) identify sub-trajectories which belong to multiple clusters.

The influence of tidal stirring on density stratification and on the distribution of nutrients and chlorophyll in this region has been investigated using a combination of a numerical model of the tidal flow and the results of two extensive surveys of property distributions in the summer regime. The Princeton Ocean Model (POM) has been used to determine the spatial structure of the tidal flow and the results have been verified by comparison with an extensive database of current and elevation measurements. The model indicates a large difference in total energy flux between the western entrance section, which is controlled by a progressive wave regime, and the eastern entrance section which is associated with a predominantly standing wave regime. The combined energy flux input matches the total energy dissipation for the M2 in the Inland Sea which is found to be ∼3.4×109W. Two ship surveys in August 2002 and 2003 along a central section show a highly differentiated pattern of vertical structure. The potential energy anomaly ϕ, an index of vertical stability based on density, exhibits a marked inverse correlation with tidal energy dissipation D¯ thus confirming the control of stratification by tidal stirring. In most straits, vertical differences of nutrients and chlorophyll are small or negligible while in the low-energy basins there are pronounced vertical differences associated with density stratification. These sluggish basins exhibit oligotrophic conditions in the surface layer but large nitrate concentrations below the pycnocline and significant chlorophyll maxima in subsurface layer. The physical pattern of varying stratification and fronts is reflected to a considerable degree in the distributions of biochemical properties.","","article","","26","","","Tidal stirring and its impact on water column stability and property distributions in a semi-enclosed shelf sea (Seto Inland Sea, Japan)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434306001221","0278-4343","2006","1295-1306","Continental Shelf Research"

These objective measures are necessary to evaluate the skills and training of drilling crews. Situational awareness (SA) describes the person's perception, comprehension, and prediction in dynamic environments. SA is critical in time-sensitive decision making, which may be especially pertinent for kick-detection and blowout mitigation. This paper presents the analyses of multiple objective SA measures in an immersive training environment. The SA for a sample of engineering-in-training students (n = 13) was measured using a well control incident simulator. The data analyses include knowledge tests, a voice log analysis, usability measures, check-lists compliance, pre/post performance surveys, and eye-tracking data. The results show that task knowledge (e.g. current pressure readings, current bit depth) was predictive of overall blowout mitigation performance. Further, the usability results provide some preliminary insights into task risk perceptions, task difficulty, and perceptions of communication.

The effectiveness of such MPAs, however, requires improvements to vessel monitoring and enforcement capability. In 2014 commercial fishing was excluded from the Ascension Island Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In 2015, through updated regulations, a licenced fishery re-opened in the northern half of the EEZ while the southern half remained closed. To assess compliance with these closures and regulations, several promising satellite technologies (Satellite Automatic Identification System (S-AIS), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) of two vessels), were trialled alongside at-sea patrols. Use of SAR enabled assessment of ‘dark’ (non-AIS transmitting) vessels, the scope of whose activities are hardest to gauge. The high level of compliance with regulations observed, suggests the MPA may prove effective, yet a need for vigilance remains. Vessels aggregate near the EEZ border and a quarter of vessels tracked across three years exhibited S-AIS transmission gaps and present a heightened compliance risk. Use of remote, rather than local, expertise and infrastructure provide a blue-print and economies of scale for replicating monitoring across similarly sized MPAs; particularly for large (>~ 25 m) vessels with metallic superstructures conducive to SAR detection. Funding ongoing monitoring in Ascension is challenged by current levels of license uptake, which provides insufficient offsetting revenue. Satellite-derived intelligence, can be used to set risk thresholds and trigger detailed investigations. Planning long-term monitoring must, however, incorporate adequate resources for follow-up, through patrols and correspondence with flag-states and fisheries management organisations.","","article","","101","","","Satellite surveillance of fishing vessel activity in the Ascension Island Exclusive Economic Zone and Marine Protected Area","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X18303002","0308-597X","2019","39-50","Marine Policy"

In this study, long-term measurements of both gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) and RM were made at two ground-based monitoring locations in Australia, the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS) in Tasmania, and the Macquarie University Automatic Weather Station (MQAWS) in Sydney, New South Wales. Measurements were also made on board the Australian RV Investigator (RVI) during an ocean research voyage to the East Antarctic coast. GEM was measured using the standard Tekran® 2537 series analytical platform, and RM was measured using cation exchange membranes (CEM) in a filter-based sampling method. Overall mean RM concentrations at CGBAPS and MQAWS were 15.9 ± 6.7 pg m−3 and 17.8 ± 6.6 pg m−3, respectively. For the 10-week austral summer period on RVI, mean RM was 23.5 ± 6.7 pg m−3. RM concentrations at CGBAPS were seasonally invariable, while those at MQAWS were significantly different between summer and winter due to seasonal changes in synoptic wind patterns. During the RVI voyage, RM concentrations were relatively enhanced along the Antarctic coast (up to 30 pg m−3) and GEM concentrations were variable (0.2 to 0.9 ng m−3), suggesting periods of enrichment and depletion. Both RM and GEM concentrations were relatively lower while transiting the Southern Ocean farther north of Antarctica. RM concentrations measured in this study were higher in comparison to most other reported measurements of RM in the global marine boundary layer (MBL), especially for remote SH locations. As observations of GEM and RM concentrations inform global ocean-atmosphere model simulations of the atmospheric Hg budget, our results have important implications for understanding of total atmospheric Hg (TAM).","","article","","751","","","Atmospheric reactive mercury concentrations in coastal Australia and the Southern Ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720352104","0048-9697","2021","141681","Science of The Total Environment"

Most prehistoric underwater sites are discovered by chance (e.g., by industry, fishermen or recreational divers). New methods for detecting submerged prehistoric settlements have been developed using sophisticated remote sensing devices, yet with limited success. Simple, practical, and inexpensive methods for locating submerged settlements remain rare. Over 60 years of underwater archaeology and submerged prehistory in Israel, specifically along the Carmel coast, has led to a model for locating and studying submerged settlements, based on sand removal by storms. This study aimed to take this model a step further by developing a new, inexpensive method to identify, locate and characterize submerged sites. We collected undisturbed paleosol cores from exposed areas as well as under a few meters of sand, using a newly developed water-jet core sampling system. The cores were analyzed using micro-geoarchaeological techniques initially developed on terrestrial sites. The rationale behind this methodology is based on established knowledge that where human settlements occur, sediments are enriched by specific mineralogical signatures (e.g., heated clay minerals) and anthropogenic micro-remain assemblages (e.g., phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and dung spherulites). Additionally, micromorphology can assist in identifying micro-stratigraphic patterns typical of human settlements. We tested sediment cores in three underwater contexts: a) exposed prehistoric surfaces within two known Neolithic sites (Atlit-Yam and Neve Yam), b) exposed paleosols without visible archaeological remains (serving as a control), and c) as a blind test, a buried paleosol currently covered by 1–3 m of sand, where the existence of a site is unknown. In the cores taken from the exposed Neolithic settlements, the micro-geoarchaeological characterization showed clear anthropogenic signals (typical mineralogy, elevated micro-remain concentrations, micro-stratigraphy). In the paleosol control cores, there was an absence (or negligible presence) of anthropogenic signals. The ‘blind test’ at the sand-covered locality revealed sediments without anthropogenic enrichments (similar to the control paleosols), thus suggesting the absence of a submerged settlement in this specific location. The new method is time- and cost-effective and can easily be applied worldwide along the shallow continental shelf as well as in deep water. The new method will facilitate discovery of new underwater sites and provide selection criteria (e.g., where the highest anthropogenic signal exists) for investment in underwater excavations. Additionally, it can be used to check for anthropogenic signals in buried locations detected by remote sensing, and to understand the spatial organization of submerged sites.","","article","","135","","","Locating submerged prehistoric settlements: A new underwater survey method using water-jet coring and micro-geoarchaeological techniques","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440321001503","0305-4403","2021","105480","Journal of Archaeological Science"

Since a large fraction of the predicted CO2 storage capacity lies offshore, there is a pressing need to develop field-tested methods to detect and quantify potential leaks in the marine environment. Here, we combine field measurements with numerical models to determine the flow rate of a controlled release of CO2 in a shallow marine setting at about 119 m water depth in the North Sea. In this experiment, CO2 was injected into the sediment at 3 m depth at 143 kg d-1. The new leakage monitoring tool predicts that 91 kg d-1 of CO2 escaped across the seafloor, and that 51 kg d-1 of CO2 were retained in the sediment, in agreement with independent field estimates. The new approach relies mostly on field data collected from ship-deployed technology (towed sensors, Acoustic Doppler current profiler—ADCP), which makes it a promising tool to monitor existing and upcoming offshore CO2 storage sites and to detect and quantify potential CO2 leakage.","","article","","109","","","Quantification of dissolved CO2 plumes at the Goldeneye CO2-release experiment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583621001390","1750-5836","2021","103387","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

To this aim Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method have been used. The SOM method is a group of artificial neural networks based on the topological properties of the human brain. Results clearly suggest that there exist three different meteorological patterns that are linked to the characteristics of electrical events found in the study area. In winter, most of the electrical events are formed under oceanic advection (NW air fluxes). On these cases, mean rainfall yield estimates reach values of 700 104 m3 per cloud to ground lightning flash (CG flash). During summer most frequent electrical storms are associated to local instability shooting by surface heating with advection of humidity coming from the Iberian Peninsula. Under these meteorological situations, rain is scarcer if compared with oceanic events but lightning CG counts reach the maximum values found in the area (about 10 CG counts per 20×20 km2 and day) giving this way the smallest rainfall yield with a mean value of 15 104 m3 per CG flash. Iberian air fluxes associated with cold air in upper parts of the atmosphere represent the third meteorological pattern found. This pattern is most common in spring and autumn but is not unusual in the rest of the seasons. In those cases mean rainfall yield in the area is about 150 104 m3 per CG flash. In all electrical episodes K instability index is greater than 15 °C but in the most lightning producing events, this index reaches in the area values greater than 24 °C. PCA results pointed out that there exists a relationship between rain and CG counts expressed by the first principal component computed from standardized data. However, we must notice that no event is solely linked to this axis, since a seasonal influence which decreases lightning production when rain increases is always present. Results found are of great interest for short term forecasting of flashfloods in mountainous areas like the Spanish Basque Country region.","","article","","89","","","Rainfall yield characteristics of electrical storm observed in the Spanish Basque Country area during the period 1992–1996","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809508000458","0169-8095","2008","233-242","Atmospheric Research"

Using multi-satellite observations and reanalysis data, this study explored biophysical responses of the upper ocean of the SCS induced by a typical super typhoon, Mangkhut (2018), and their regional differences with potential mechanisms. There were three different significant-response regions in the whole SCS, as follows: (1) In the ocean area around the typhoon path, strong vertical mixing, upwelling and cooling were induced, resulting in the surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration enhancing markedly (three-fold). Particularly, asymmetric distribution of typhoon rainfall induced asymmetric sea surface salinity change over along the path the nearshore. Diurnal peak of chl-a concentration increased obviously, and the daily growth rate of chl-a sped up considerably in non-shore areas after Mangkhut's passage. (2) In the Beibu Gulf (BBG), the peripheral winds of Mangkhut caused a change in direction of the sea surface flow field, transporting the high-temperature and high-salinity surface seawater from the southeastern area to the BBG. This induced dramatic increases in sea surface temperature, salinity and height, and a decrease in chl-a, in most areas of BBG. (3) In the southwest SCS, the southwest monsoon–induced eastward offshore upwelling jet was weakened by the opposite large-scale peripheral wind vector of Mangkhut and gradually disappeared, resulting in accumulation and enhancement of chl-a in the nearshore. In addition, Mangkhut peripheral winds also intensified (weakened), shifting the cold (warm) eddy to the north (south) and blocking the horizontal eastward transport belt of the high-concentration chl-a. In general, our present work sheds light on the new evidence that a supper typhoon can cause basin-wide anomalies in the SCS, which has broad implications for marine biophysical environment.","","article","","731","","","Basin-wide responses of the South China Sea environment to Super Typhoon Mangkhut (2018)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326103","0048-9697","2020","139093","Science of The Total Environment"

Here we present a middle to late Holocene, diatom-derived water-table records from a peatland in the Greater Hinggan Mountains, northeastern China. An age-depth model was achieved through AMS14C dating and Bayesian piece-wise linear accumulation modelling. The diatom-based water-table reconstructions show that the peatland water-table rose from 5100 to 3500 cal. yr BP, but fell approximately 3500 cal. yr BP. From about 2800 to 1500 cal. yr BP, the peatland water-table stabilized. After about 1500 cal. yr BP, several rapid hydrological shifts, which correspond with global climate anomalies such as ice-rafted debris (IRD) events, were registered in the reconstructed water-tables. Compared with other paleoclimate records in East Asia, the general trend of peatland water-table fluctuations follows the variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) intensity. Spectrum analysis of the water-table profile yielded a statistically significant periodicity of 470-year that may be related to the “~500-year” inherent solar irradiation cycles. In addition, positive correlation between the peatland water-table levels and cosmic-isotope-reconstructed sunspot numbers underscores the role of the sun in regulating hydrological processes in the EASM margin area. The data suggest that the regional climate and hydrological variations at the EASM margin were first triggered by changes in solar output, but may have been amplified by interactions with oceanic and atmospheric circulations.","","article","","725","","","Diatom evidence for mid-Holocene peatland water-table variations and their possible link to solar forcing","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972031785X","0048-9697","2020","138272","Science of The Total Environment"

However, the impacts of changing snow storage on summer low flows in low-elevation, snow-affected catchments has not yet been investigated. To address this knowledge gap, the dominant hydroclimate predictors of summer low flows were first identified through correlation analysis in 12 tributary catchments of the St. Lawrence River in the Canadian province of Quebec. The correlation results show that summer low flow is most sensitive to summer rainfall, while maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) is the dominant winter preconditioning factor of low flows, particularly at the end of summer. The multivariate sensitivity of summer low flow to hydroclimate predictors was then quantified by multilevel regression analysis, considering also the effect of catchment biophysical attributes. Accumulated rainfall since snow cover disappearance was found to be the prime control on summer low flow, as expected for the humid climate of Quebec. Maximum SWE had a secondary but significant positive influence on low flow, sometimes on the same order as the negative effect of evapotranspiration losses. As a whole, our results show that in these low elevation catchments, thicker winter snowpacks that last longer and melt slower in the spring are conducive to higher low flows in the following summer. More rugged and forested catchments with coarser soils were found to have higher summer low flows than flatter agricultural catchments with compacted clayed soils. This emphasizes the role of soils and geology on infiltration, aquifer recharge and related river baseflow in summer. Further climate warming and snowpack depletion could reduce future summer low flow, exacerbating hydrological droughts and impacting ecosystems integrity and ecological services.","","article","","605","","","Impacts of summer and winter conditions on summer river low flows in low elevation, snow-affected catchments","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421014438","0022-1694","2022","127393","Journal of Hydrology"

Further up-valley, moraine boulders deposited at 4.5 ka indicate that glaciers were more extensive during the mid-Holocene than at any later time. The youngest exposure ages in our study, 150–450 years, constrain the formation of moraines situated within 500 m from the present-day Mangaehuehu Glacier terminus. These ages are in agreement with historic sources that show the glacier close to these moraine limits approximately 100 years ago. Overall our data show that glaciers on Mt. Ruapehu retreated c. 3 km since 14 ka, in response to a net rise in the local equlibrium line altitude of c. 400 m. The magnitude of post-industrial snowline rise and glacier retreat on Mt. Ruapehu is also consistent with instrumental temperature data that record approximately 0.9 ∘C of warming during the 20th century.","","article","","223","","","Late-glacial and Holocene glacier fluctuations in North Island, New Zealand","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379119304585","0277-3791","2019","105914","Quaternary Science Reviews"

This provided an opportunity to study positive effects on environment and subsequent impact on terrestrial ecosystems such as urban, peri-urban, forest and agriculture. A variety of studies presented so far mainly include improved air quality index, water quality, reduced pollutants etc. The present study focused on few novel parameters from both polar and geostationary satellites that are not studied in context to India, and also attempts deriving/quantifying benefits rather than merely indicating qualitative improvements. Due to lack of anthropogenic activities during complete lockdown-1 (21 days from 25 March 2020) in India nighttime cooling of land surface temperature (LST) of the order of 2–6 K was observed. Amongst 10 major cities, Bhopal showed highest nighttime cooling. The cooling effect in LST was evident in 80% of industrial units distinctly indicating cooling trend. Vegetation fires were analyzed in 10 fire-prone states of India. Compared to past four-years average number of occurrences, only 45% fire occurrences occurred during lockdown, indicating strong effect of lockdown. The study also revealed that, there is increase in gross primary production in forest ecosystem to the tune of maximum 38%, during this period. Though delay in rabi crop harvest date by 1–2 weeks in majority of north Indian states was observed rise in rabi crop productivity of the order of maximum 34% was observed which is attributed to favorable environmental conditions for net carbon uptake. About 18% reduction in volumetric agricultural water demand was estimated in Indo-Gangetic region, parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Apart from controlling the spread of the disease, the lockdown restrictions were thus also able to show positive effects on the environment and ecosystem which might influence to rethink on strategies for sustainable development.","","article","","22","","","New findings on impact of COVID lockdown over terrestrial ecosystems from LEO-GEO satellites","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352938521000124","2352-9385","2021","100476","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment"

Indeed, SG cyber-physical connectivity is subject to several vulnerabilities that can damage or disrupt its process immunity via cyberthreats. Today's ICSs are experiencing highly complex data change and dynamism, increasing the complexity of detecting and mitigating cyberattacks. Subsequently, and since Machine Learning (ML) is widely studied in cybersecurity, the objectives of this paper are twofold. First, for algorithmic simplicity, a small-scale ML algorithm that attempts to reduce computational costs is proposed. The algorithm adopts a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to easily and efficiently accomplish the learning procedures. Second, to solve the data complexity problem regarding rapid change and dynamism, a label autoencoding approach is introduced for Embedding Labels in the NAHL (EL-NAHL) architecture to take advantage of labels propagation when separating data scatters. Furthermore, to provide a more realistic analysis by addressing real-world threat scenarios, a dataset of an electric traction substation used in the high-speed rail industry is adopted in this work. Compared to some existing algorithms and other previous works, the achieved results show that the proposed EL-NAHL architecture is effective even under massive dynamically changed and imbalanced data.","","article","","226","","","EL-NAHL: Exploring labels autoencoding in augmented hidden layers of feedforward neural networks for cybersecurity in smart grids","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832022003131","0951-8320","2022","108680","Reliability Engineering & System Safety"

The study is based on the use of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity data retrieved from ZEUS system, operated by the National Observatory of Athens, and examines the seasonal, diurnal and spatial variability of the lightning activity. The effect of elevation, terrain slope, vegetation cover and convective available potential energy (CAPE) on the distribution of the CG lightning strokes is also investigated. Lightning is modulated by the diurnal cycle of insolation and the underlying topographic features of the region. The lightning strokes are more numerous over the mainland than over the sea. CG lightning activity is dominant over the land and the coastal areas during spring and summer while during the coldest period of the year it is dominant over the sea. The maximum value of lightning activity is observed in June and mostly in the afternoon. The orography and the terrain slope affect the distribution of lightning. During the warmest period of the year, the forested areas have an increased “lightning yield”. The number of CG lightning strokes increases with increasing CAPE and the high correlation between them indicates that CAPE values could be used as a proxy for the presence of lightning activity, at least over the eastern Mediterranean region.","","article","","166","","","A ten-year analysis of cloud-to-ground lightning activity over the Eastern Mediterranean region","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809515002203","0169-8095","2015","213-222","Atmospheric Research"

Process Mining (PM), a set of business-process-related diagnostic and improvement techniques, can tackle these weaknesses, but literature lacks contributions that address this possibility concretely. Thus, by framing PM as an Expert System (ES) engine, this paper presents a five-step PM-based methodology for IS audits and validates it through a case in a freight export port process managed by a Port Community System (PCS), an open electronic platform enabling information exchange among port stakeholders. The validation pointed out some advantages (e.g. depth of analysis, easier automation, less invasiveness) of our PM-enabled methodology over extant ESs and tools for IS audit. The substantive test and the check on the PCS processing controls and output controls allowed to identify four major non-conformances likely implying both legal and operational risks, and two unforeseen process deviations that were not known by the port authority, but that could improve the flexibility of the process. These outcomes set the stage for an export process reengineering, and for revising the boundaries in the process flow of the PCS.","","article","","110","","","Process-mining-enabled audit of information systems: Methodology and an application","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417418303300","0957-4174","2018","80-92","Expert Systems with Applications"

In this study, a framework for identifying and analyzing fishing footprints and activities based on AIS data is proposed. The first step is the AIS data pre-processing. Through the screening and cleaning of AIS data, noise data such as non-fishing vessel trajectories are removed to retain only fishing vessel trajectories. The second step is the behavior detection of fishing vessels. Based on the proposed speed identification method, the trajectory of a fishing vessel is divided into three states: Fishing, stationary, and sailing. The third step is the calculation of fishing vessel activities. An adjacent point mean method is proposed to calculate the fishing time of each fishing point. In addition, two simple and efficient quantitative indicators, namely unit cell activity frequency (UCAF) and unit cell fishing time (UCFT), are proposed to quantify the activities of fishing vessels. The last step is the spatial and temporal analysis of fishing activities. The global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi* index are used to quantitatively describe the global spatio-temporal distribution and local spatio-temporal hotspots of fishing activities. Based on >130 million AIS data from 2015 to 2016, the footprints of fishing vessels in the waters of China's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) were analyzed and the 0.01° × 0.01° high-resolution fishing vessel activity distribution maps and fishing time distribution maps were generated. It is found that the footprints of fishing vessels in China's EEZ waters have a positive spatial correlation, and the areas with high fishing intensities are clustered in the coastal waters of Shandong Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and Guangdong Province. The research results can be used for fishing area identification, fishery policy making, and sustainable fisheries development.","","article","","187","","","Footprints of fishing vessels in Chinese waters based on automatic identification system data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110122000934","1385-1101","2022","102255","Journal of Sea Research"

We estimate the spectral characteristics of lightning and TLEs by converting the optical data obtained by the ISUAL limb experiment to the GLIMS nadir geometry. We find that the estimated spectral shapes of TLE-accompanied lightning are clearly different from those of pure lightning. The obtained results show that (1) the intensity of FUV signals and (2) the ratio of 337/red (609–753nm) spectral irradiance are useful to identify the occurrence of TLEs. The occurrence probabilities of TLEs are 10%, 40%, 80%, in the case of lightning events having the 337/red spectral irradiance ratio of 0.95, 2.95, 14.79, respectively. By using the 60% criterion of the 337/red ratio and the existence of FUV emissions, we classify the 1039 GLIMS-observed lightning events into 828 pure lightning and 211 TLE-accompanied lightning. Since the GLIMS trigger level is adjusted to observe extremely-bright events, the occurrence probability of TLEs obtained here most probably reflects the characteristics of energetic lightning. The estimated global map is consistent with previously determined distributions: the highest activities of lightning and TLEs are found over the North/South American continents, African continent, and Asian maritime regions. While the absolute occurrence number of pure lightning and TLE-accompanied lightning are found to maximize in the equatorial region, the occurrence probability of TLEs possibly increase somewhat in the mid-latitude region. Since the occurrence probabilities of TLEs are higher over the ocean than over land, it is likely that the GLIMS-observed TLEs are due primarily to elves which tends to occur more frequently over the ocean.","","article","","145","","","Identifying the occurrence of lightning and transient luminous events by nadir spectrophotometric observation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682616301109","1364-6826","2016","85-97","Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics"

Two multi-institutional, multi-instrument campaigns, one under ‘Space Weather: Science and Applications’ and the other emphasizing tides under ‘Atmospheric Coupling Processes’ were conducted during February–April 2006. The highlights of the campaigns include improved prediction of equatorial spread-F (ESF) based on a ‘new factor’ combining the strength and asymmetry of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA); simultaneous detection of quasi-2-day wave at both E and F region heights; tomographic image showing a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) in association with a counter electrojet (CEJ) event—all highlighting the neutral and electrodynamical coupling of the equatorial ionosphere−thermosphere regions; an unusual lowering of mesospheric temperature during a moderate geomagnetic storm—highlighting a new space weather effect; diurnal tide showing a peak amplitude of 35m/s at 45km in zonal wind and a significantly lower amplitude (∼15m/s) in the meridional wind and also evidence of convective activity in the lower atmosphere influencing the tidal variability in the Mesosphere−Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region highlighting the vertical coupling of the atmospheric regions. The development of models for equatorial and low latitude ionosphere has been among the prime activities taken up under ‘Space Climate’. Two models have been developed towards this end: one based on Second Degree (SD) relationships of F region parameters to the mean sun spot number and the other a Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) based model involving expressions relating F region parameters to that representing solar and geomagnetic activities. The two models, intended for long and short term predictions, have been found to represent the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere over Indian longitudes better than the commonly used International Reference Ionosphere (IRI).

Current satellite-based methods for mapping SWE over Québec's main hydropower basins do not meet Hydro-Québec operational requirements for SWE accuracies with less than 15% error. This paper assesses the accuracy of the GlobSnow-2 (GS-2) SWE product, which combines microwave satellite data and in situ measurements, for hydrological applications in Québec. GS-2 SWE values for a 30-year period (1980 to 2009) were compared with space- and time-matched values from a comprehensive dataset of in situ SWE measurements (a total of 38,990 observations in Eastern Canada). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GS-2 SWE product is 94.1±20.3mm, corresponding to an overall relative percentage error (RPE) of 35.9%. The main sources of uncertainty are wet and deep snow conditions (when SWE is higher than 150mm), and forest cover type. However, compared to a typical stand-alone brightness temperature channel difference algorithm, the assimilation of surface information in the GS-2 algorithm clearly improves SWE accuracy by reducing the RPE by about 30%. Comparison of trends in annual mean and maximum SWE between surface observations and GS-2 over 1980–2009 showed agreement for increasing trends over southern Québec, but less agreement on the sign and magnitude of trends over northern Québec.

However, the historical changes in navigability of trans-Arctic routes remain unclear, and projections by global circulation models (GCMs) contain large uncertainties since they cannot simulate long-term Arctic sea ice changes. In this study, we determined the changes in trans-Arctic routes from 1979 to 2019 by combining two harmonized high-quality daily sea ice products. We found that the trans-Arctic routes are becoming navigable much faster than projected by the GCMs. The navigation season for open water (OW) vessels along the Northeast Passage (NEP) has lengthened from occasionally navigable in the 1980 s to 92 ± 15 days in the 2010 s. In contrast, previous GCM projections have suggested that navigability would not be achieved until the mid-21st century. The 90-day safety shipping area for OW vessels expanded by 35% during 1979–2018, reaching 8.28 million km2 in 2018, indicating an increasing rate of 0.08 ± 0.01 million km2 per year. The shortest trans-Arctic routes were also shifted further north than the model projections. Regular ships have been able to safely travel north along the islands in the NEP and transit through the M’Clure Strait in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago during the 2010 s, while previous studies have projected that this would not be feasible until the mid-21st century. We also found that the improved navigability of trans-Arctic routes enables commercial ships to transport approximately 33–66% (at the same load factor) more goods from East Asia to Europe during the Arctic shipping season than by the traditional Suez Canal route. These findings highlight the need for aggressive actions to develop mandatory rules that promote navigation safety and strengthen environmental protection in the Arctic.","","article","","73","","","Trans-Arctic shipping routes expanding faster than the model projections","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378022000267","0959-3780","2022","102488","Global Environmental Change"

The results are correlated to the mode of formation and physical properties and are instrumental in establishing the geographical origin of a gem opal. The geochemistry of an opal is shown to be dependant mostly on the host rock, at least for examples from Mexico and Brazil, even if modified by weathering processes. In order of decreasing concentration, the main impurities present are Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, and Mg (more than 500 ppm). Other noticeable elements in lesser amounts are Ba, followed by Zr, Sr, Rb, U, and Pb. For the first time, geochemistry helps to discriminate some varieties of opals. The Ba content, as well as the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, are the keys to separating sedimentary opals (Ba>110 ppm, Eu and Ce anomalies) from volcanic opals (Ba<110 ppm, no Eu or Ce anomaly). The Ca content, and to a lesser extent that of Mg, Al, K and Nb, helps to distinguish gem opals from different volcanic environments. The limited range of concentrations for all elements in precious (play-of-color) compared to common opals, indicates that this variety must have very specific, or more restricted, conditions of formation. We tentatively interpreted the presence of impurities in terms of crystallochemistry, even if opal is a poorly crystallized or amorphous material. The main replacement is the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+. The induced charge imbalance is compensated chiefly by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Na+. In terms of origin of color, greater concentrations of iron induce darker colors (from yellow to “chocolate brown”).

The primary purpose of this study is to understand the recent formation and geomorphological evolution of the fluvial bar in the final portion of the Magdalena River. The geomorphological evolution analysis was made possible using Geographic Information Systems tools, satellite images, and bathymetric data. The studied bar formed and stabilized through anthropic and natural factors such as port structures (obstacles to sediment transport), channel morphology, and natural- and anthropic-caused variation to the sediment supply. The lateral bar formation, adjacent to port structures, began in 2017 with surface runoff accumulating and anchored on the riverbank since 2018. At present, the bar covers 45% of the original river width, and an approximate sediment volume worth 4,000,000 m3 has accumulated. Changes in the navigable channel result in slope modification from 2.02° to 5.36°. The construction of port structures, i.e. new pile bridges, changes the natural sediment flow, because they are obstacles, trapping sediments downstream. This period coincides with the end of a weak El Niño cycle, subsequent to a La Nina period also of low intensity, with reduced precipitation rates resulting in a decrease in flow, and therefore contributing to an increase in sedimentation. The observations suggest that it is crucial to understand the channel bars' morphology and origin to avoid possible economic and social impacts due to the disruptions in navigation.","","article","","275","","","Recent geomorphological evolution of channel bar in Magdalena River (Colombia) due to natural and anthropogenic interferences","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771422002177","0272-7714","2022","107959","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science"

For geological CO2 storage to be safe, reliable, and accepted by society, robust strategies for CO2 leakage detection, quantification and management are crucial. The STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine Carbon Capture and Storage) project aimed to provide techniques and understanding to enable and inform cost-effective monitoring of CCS sites in the marine environment. A controlled CO2 release experiment was carried out in the central North Sea, designed to mimic an unintended emission of CO2 from a subsurface CO2 storage site to the seafloor. A total of 675 kg of CO2 were released into the shallow sediments (∼3 m below seafloor), at flow rates between 6 and 143 kg/d. A combination of novel techniques, adapted versions of existing techniques, and well-proven standard techniques were used to detect, characterise and quantify gaseous and dissolved CO2 in the sediments and the overlying seawater. This paper provides an overview of this ambitious field experiment. We describe the preparatory work prior to the release experiment, the experimental layout and procedures, the methods tested, and summarise the main results and the lessons learnt.","","article","","106","","","Towards improved monitoring of offshore carbon storage: A real-world field experiment detecting a controlled sub-seafloor CO2 release","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583620306629","1750-5836","2021","103237","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

Stalagmite KT-3 from Katalekhor Cave began growing ∼9.5 ka under wet early Holocene conditions coincident with the timing of Sapropel 1. At this time δ18O values were at or below −9.0‰, stalagmite growth diameter was at its maximum, 234U/238U0 activity values were low and trace element contents indicate flushing of the epikarst. Progressive reduction in winter precipitation amount after 7.0 ka, is recorded by increasing δ18O and 234U/238U0 activity values and reduction in trace element contents and growth diameter until ∼2.0 ka. These trends follow the reduction in summer insolation and agree with model-simulated changes in total rainfall and rainwater isotopes. Sub-centennial-scale variability is not a feature of the δ18O or trace element records; this suggests a stable winter recharge regime, a feature that might militate against KT-3 δ18O recording changes in the seasonality of rainfall. KT-3 δ13C compositions are enriched relative to lower altitude stalagmites in the Levant, implying low soil CO2 contribution (thin montane soils). However, a broadly decreasing millennial-scale trend in δ13C suggests that soil carbon contributions increased with time despite the progressive reduction in winter precipitation amount. The δ13C changes probably reflect decreasing summer temperatures and less extreme wintertime coldness, driven by reducing summer- and increasing winter-insolation respectively. These combined effects decreased effective evaporation and improved soil-moisture availability favouring vegetation development during the growth season. The δ13C values also show ∼1.5‰ centennial-scale variability with higher δ13C values between 9.0 and 8.7 ka, 8.3–7.7 ka, 6.5–5.5 ka, 5.4–4.5 ka and ∼4.3–2.0 ka: three of these correspond with Rapid Climate Change (RCC) events based on non-seasalt potassium (K+) in Greenland ice cores. Higher δ13C values indicate poor soil development caused by aridity. The centennial-scale δ13C anomaly (8.3–7.7 ka) is in part overprinted by the ∼160 year-long, 8.2 ka cold/dry event, but culmination ∼7.7 ka corresponds with other records suggesting an intensified Siberian High Pressure system affecting regional climate. The centennial-scale δ13C anomaly between 4.3 and 2.0 ka overlaps the 2.65 to 2.50 ka ‘Assyrian megadrought’ evident in stalagmite stable isotope records in northern Iraq. The KT-3 record is key in better understanding Holocene climate change in the central Zagros region, representative of montane ‘fertile crescent’ environments.","","article","","241","","","Holocene stable isotope record of insolation and rapid climate change in a stalagmite from the Zagros of Iran","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379120303954","0277-3791","2020","106433","Quaternary Science Reviews"

The predominance of tiny pyrite framboids, high Corg/P, U/Th, and V/Cr ratios, generally higher enrichments of redox-sensitive metals such as Mo, U, V, and depletion in Mn suggest anoxic/euxinic conditions at the sea bottom. Moreover, we found very large anomalous Hg spikes (with maximum values reaching 3650 ppb) for the first time in the mid-Tournaisian deep-water marine succession of the Carnic Alps.

A post-event survey indicated EF0 and EF1 damage in houses of the village – roofs and ceilings, broken windows, fences and walls and trees knocked down – along a track approximately 4km long and about 20m wide. Doppler radar observations show that the parent thunderstorm that spawned the tornado was one of a series that developed along a convective line that moved from S to N, initiating convective activity in terms of precipitation and lightning in the Mediterranean Sea and moving inland in S Catalonia (Tarragona and Salou coastal areas, producing local flash floods). Convective activity remained several hours with series of thunderstorms developing along the same paths. The synoptic situation was dominated by a high pressure ridge extending from northern Africa to central Europe, with a closed maximum sea level pressure area around 1036hPa over northern France, southern Germany and Austria. On the other hand a relative low pressure area seen on 850hPa and upper levels was present over the Iberian Peninsula, favouring a southern maritime flow from the Mediterranean between the forward part of the low pressure area and the high pressure system which blocked the advance of the low to the east. In the study we examine both the synoptic environment and storm scale observations with Doppler radar and total lightning data (cloud to ground and intracloud flashes) that lead to this cool-season severe convective event which is remarkable given the fact that, unlike in this case, most reported tornadoes in the region occur during the warm season (with peaks in August and September) and during daylight hours (6 to 18 UTC).","","article","","158-159","","","A study of the 21 March 2012 tornadic quasi linear convective system in Catalonia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809514003366","0169-8095","2015","192-209","Atmospheric Research"

However, there is insufficient information on oak growth in the Baltic region. Climate–growth interactions have been mostly investigated by correlation/response analysis between ring width and climatic factors. Other wood anatomical proxies, and also pointer year analysis, which focuses on weather extremes, can be sources of additional information. Wood samples were taken from 40 sites across Latvia. Tree-ring width (TRW) and mean area of earlywood vessels (EVA) were measured. To assess differences in wood formation among sites, a PCA was performed based on pointer year series of TRW and EVA per site. The relation with climate was assessed by Pearson's correlation. Patterns of wood formation differed along west/east gradient, so that two regions (western and eastern) of Latvia were distinguished. Pointer year values were higher for TRW than for EVA and higher in the eastern than in the western region. However, the pointer year values were moderate, suggesting that there was no strict limiting factor for their formation. Pointer years of EVA were strongly related with temperature during the dormant period in both regions; June precipitation had a significant effect in the eastern region. Pointer years of TRW were correlated with spring and summer temperature in the western region and with February temperature in the eastern region; precipitation in autumn showed a negative effect. These differences can be explained by a gradient from maritime to continental climate, leading to shifts in the growth limiting factors. Extremely cold winters resulted in most of the negative pointer years of TRW and EVA.","","article","","31","","","Pointer years in tree-ring width and earlywood-vessel area time series of Quercus robur—Relation with climate factors near its northern distribution limit","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1125786512000781","1125-7865","2013","129-139","Dendrochronologia"

The similar chemical behaviour across the whole REY, i.e. the lanthanide series (lanthanum to lutetium) and yttrium, allows their use as tracers, fingerprinting rock-forming processes and fluid-rock interactions in earth science systems. However, their use in fingerprinting waste and particularly low-level radioactive waste has not received much attention, despite the direct use of REE in the nuclear industry and the traditional use of REE as proxies to understand the environmental mobility of the actinide series (actinium to lawrencium). The highly instrumented low-level radioactive waste site at Little Forest (Australia) allows a detailed REY study, investigating interactions with local strata, neighbouring waste forms and shallow groundwater flows. Groundwater samples and solids from cored materials were recovered from 2007 to 2012 from the study site and regional baseline sites in the same geological materials. The REY in water samples were analysed by automated chelation pre-concentration (SeaFast, ESI) followed by ICP-MS determination, while solid samples were analysed using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence scanning (ITRAX). Solid rocks showed no REY departed from typical Upper Crust compositions in either Little Forest or regional background sites. Shallow groundwater from ~4–5 m, at or slightly below waste trench levels, showed water-waste interaction as a marked enrichment, relative to shale-normalised patterns, in samarium, europium and gadolinium, with depleted yttrium. Leachate samples from the neighbouring urban landfill show different REY normalised patterns. REY distribution changes with depth through increased interaction with shales and sandstones. Variations in pH and redox conditions lead to widespread precipitation of Fe-hydroxides, which scavenge REY with differential uptake by precipitating solids, resulting in increases in Y and higher Y/Ho ratio in the groundwater along the flow path. Our study revealed that the Little Forest low-level radioactive waste has a REY fingerprint different to that of groundwater in surrounding land uses. REY can be used to fingerprint diverse waste sources, assess the mobility of lanthanides inferring the mobility of selected actinides, and to trace the fate of REY during groundwater recharge. The approach presented can refine source allocation and trace pollutant mobility in current and legacy urban, mixed and radioactive waste sites around the world.","","article","","830","","","Rare earth elements and yttrium as tracers of waste/rock-groundwater interactions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722017995","0048-9697","2022","154706","Science of The Total Environment"

Methods: Clinical examinations were performed on 27 members, with 11 affected from one family in which the IGD occurred in association with the nonocular features of ARS, and on 70 members with 30 affected from a second IGD family with ocular features only. Family members were genotyped for markers within the 4q25 region known to contain a locus for ARS. LOD scores were calculated with the MLINK option of the LINKAGE program. Results: The iris hypoplasia in each IGD family was similar. In the IGD family with only ocular features (IGD anomaly), however, a majority of those affected had a goniodysgenesis with excess tissue in the angle and anomalous angle vascularity. These findings were absent in the IGD family with syndromic features (IGD syndrome). Linkage to the 4q25 region was excluded in the IGD anomaly family, whereas the family with IGD syndrome was found to be completely linked to the 4q25 region (peak LOD score with D4S407 of 7.827 at θ = 0.00). Conclusions: The authors' results suggest that mutations at the 4q25 locus can result in variable ocular features that also occur in combination with nonocular (dental and jaw) anomalies. Mutation of a separate locus must underlie IGD with ocular features only. A re-evaluation of the relation between the various forms of autosomal-dominant iris hypoplasia, therefore, may be warranted.","","article","","103","","","Autosomal-dominant Iridogoniodysgenesis and Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome are Genetically Distinct","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161642096304089","0161-6420","1996","1907-1915","Ophthalmology"

The representation and analysis of the transient response in the frequency domain is an attractive approach for fault detection due to its high noise tolerance and the linearized equations allows for the clear analytical characterization of system behaviour. Recent studies have demonstrated that an extended partial constriction of the pipe flow area causes changes in the system resonant frequencies and these changes can be used for locating and sizing partial blockages in pipes. Despite the successful application of this technique under field conditions, so far there is little work on the link between the changes in the system resonant conditions and the wave-blockage interaction. This paper provides a fundamental basis for the observation that unlike localised, discrete blockages, an extended blockage creates changes in the system resonant frequencies. Analytical methods using wave perturbation analysis and transfer matrix are shown in this study, and the obtained results are compared with numerical simulations and experimental data. The analytical analyses are used to explain the blockage-induced frequency shifts and to provide insights for its practical applications in pressurized water pipelines.","","article","","70","","","Transient Wave-blockage Interaction in Pressurized Water Pipelines","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705814000654","1877-7058","2014","573-582","Procedia Engineering"

The atmospheric and water inflow of material from spoil tips changes (in the cases studied - worsens) a state of steppe soils within a radius of 1 km, and leads to the increase of heavy metal content in these soils.","","article","","184","","","Environmental impact of disposal of coal mining wastes on soils and plants in Rostov Oblast, Russia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375674217303953","0375-6742","2018","261-270","Journal of Geochemical Exploration"

The main premise is to replace the mathematical puzzle, which constitutes a fundamental part of the Proof-of-Work mechanism, with NP-hard optimization problems whose solutions benefit the participants of the blockchain. We demonstrate its usefulness in the context of transportation. Accordingly, PoUW-based blockchain not only tracks, manages and validates transactions, but also optimizes transportation requests profiting its ecosystem.

During medical image acquisition, random noise is added, which results in a lower contrast in those images. For that, image denoising is a crucial task for medical imaging analysis. In this study, a denoising system using three heterogeneous medical datasets is proposed based on stacked convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) technique. To validate its efficiency, different evaluation metrics are used, such as mean squared error (MSE), Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and cross correlation (CC). The proposed denoising system gives good results among the medical and microscopic datasets that are used for training. The best average results obtained are 0.0039 for MSE, 24.07 for PSNR, 0.1220 for CNR, 0.85 for SSIM, and 0.6358 for CC.

The primary aim of this study is to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) system to effectively detect damage in harbor caissons. To this end, through performing dynamic analysis, acceleration signals are extracted from the locations in the model corresponding to the presumed accelerometer's placement in an actual structure. Three levels of white Gaussian noises are added to the original signal to simulate the ambient noise. Using the acquired signals, the damage-sensitive features in both frequency and time domains are determined in the structure. In this study, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the damage-sensitive features associated with the damaged and undamaged structure are reduced in dimensionality and classified. Hence, the introduced system can assess the state of the structure based on the input signal from the accelerometer and detect possible damage and its severity.

This physical complexity of SEA is coupled with one of the world's most challenging environments for both in situ and remote sensing observation. The 7-Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) program was formed to facilitate interdisciplinary research into the integrated SEA aerosol environment via grass roots style collaboration. In support of the early 7SEAS program and the affiliated Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS), this review was created to outline the network of connections linking aerosol particles in SEA with meteorology, climate and the total earth system. In this review, we focus on and repeatedly link back to our primary data source: satellite aerosol remote sensing and associated observability issues. We begin with a brief rationale for the program, outlining key aerosol impacts and, comparing their magnitudes to the relative uncertainty of observations. We then discuss aspects of SEA's physical, socio-economic and biological geography relevant to meteorology and observability issues associated with clouds and precipitation. We show that not only does SEA pose significant observability challenges for aerosol particles, but for clouds and precipitation as well. With the fundamentals of the environment outlined, we explore SEA's most studied aerosol issue: biomass burning. We summarize research on bulk aerosol properties for SEA, including a short synopsis of recent AERONET observations. We describe long range transport patterns. Finally, considerable attention is paid to satellite aerosol observability issues, with a face value comparison of common aerosol products in the region including passive and active aerosol products as well as fluxes. We show that satellite data products diverge greatly due to a host of known artifacts. These artifacts have important implications for how research is conducted, and care must be taken when using satellite products to study aerosol problems.

Here we assess past changes in SWW influence over the last ∼17,000 years using terrestrial paleoclimate records from southwestern Patagonia (∼52°S).

Because SAR remote sensing is not restricted by light conditions, it can work at night, in heavy fog, overcast and rainy days, and has become one of the important techniques for monitoring oil spills on the sea.

However, separating DCCs from thick anvils with satellite passive measurements is challenging. In this work, a day/night unified tropical DCC detection approach for MODIS observations is developed with a CloudSat active sensor measurement trained machine learning model. This approach combines brightness temperatures (BTs) at 6.7 μm (BT6.7) and 11 μm (BT11) with derived variables describing horizontal structures of DCCs and improves the tropical DCC probability of detection (POD) from 45.0% for the widely-used BT11 < 215 K method to 67.9%, while the false alarm ratio (FAR) decreases from 43.9% to 32.6%. The Heidke skill score (HSS) of the new algorithm is 0.425, which is more than doubled compared to the HSS of the BT11 < 215 K method (0.182). Moreover, the new algorithm has small biases in DCC's total amount and spatial distribution compared with the CloudSat results. The monthly DCC variations from MODIS wide-swath measurements with the new algorithm demonstrate the ability to reliably provide high temporal and spatial resolution DCC distributions to support intra-seasonal to interannual climate variability studies, which the CloudSat narrow-swath measurements lack enough samples to do. Meanwhile, the new algorithm can also be applied to measurements from other satellite passive sensors when BT6.7 and BT11 are available.","","article","","297","","","Improved tropical deep convective cloud detection using MODIS observations with an active sensor trained machine learning algorithm","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003139","0034-4257","2023","113762","Remote Sensing of Environment"

High resolution magnetic survey for soil monitoring: detection of drainage and soil tillage effects. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 212 (1–2), 241–251]. However, when the magnetic anomalies are only a few nanoteslas (nT), the geologic and pedogenic signal must first be isolated from magnetic disturbances for this method to be useful. This paper investigates the instrumental artifacts and environmental disturbances to adapt the survey protocol to slightly magnetic soils. Among the possible instrumental sources of disturbances listed and quantified, the most significant are: 1) The battery effect upon sensors 2 m away (classic protocol, about ±0.15 nT) while increasing this distance up to 10 m cancelled it; 2) The noise level of magnetometers and sensors, which, according to tests on two magnetometers and three sensors, rarely and randomly exceeds 0.1 nT, but seems to increase with the electronic component age. Among the environmental disturbances, temporal variations such as diurnal variation or fluctuations linked to the moving of metallic masses play a major role, although the pseudogradient or base-station methods have commonly cancelled them. The efficiency of the latter is strongly dependent on the source nature. However, the ground currents and electromagnetic fields propagating in soils cause more problems. As a first step to better understand such disturbance sources, uncommon magnetic signal variations supposedly due to electromagnetic wave conversions and likely linked to the railway traffic are presented. Based on previous results, an adapted protocol using one magnetometer and two caesium sensors (0.3 and 1.6 m above the surface) is proposed to increase the signal/noise ratio. At first, to maintain an accurate horizontal and vertical location of the sensors, the latter are affixed to a wooden handcart running on plastic rails. Rails adapt to micro-topography, thereby decreasing strongly the soil–sensors distance variations. Anomalies due to topography rarely exceed 0.1 nT. Finally, a method to remove diurnal variations from high-resolution magnetic maps is proposed. Parallel profiles performed successively are adjusted by a cross-profile. Assuming that the temporal variations during each profile are negligible (less than 0.05 nT), this technique, contrary to the pseudogradient, preserves both the decimetric and the metric anomalies (gain of more than 1 nT).","","article","","58","","","Soil anomaly mapping using a caesium magnetometer: Limits in the low magnetic amplitude case","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985105000571","0926-9851","2006","202-217","Journal of Applied Geophysics"

However, ship engine data collected from various sensors have high dimensions, large measurement errors, few labeled data, and insufficient amounts and quality of data, making it difficult to determine the condition of engines with complex failure modes under various operating environments.This study proposes a hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis (HL-FDD) method that combines domain knowledge of ship engines and advanced data analysis techniques. The developed method extracts key features of reduced dimensions from the original variables (sensors) through an optimal hierarchical clustering and dimension-reduction model, allowing a hierarchy divided into the top (the entire system combining all features), middle (subsystems and feature sets), and bottom (components and sensors) levels. The reduced key features are used to generate robust regression models and dynamic thresholds (prediction intervals) according to the engine load, and dynamic thresholds determine whether the engine’s condition is normal or abnormal. The dynamic thresholds are able to automatically label abnormal conditions of the engine. Once anomalies are detected at the top level, the proposed method can sequentially search for data on features belonging to the middle and bottom hierarchies for detailed fault diagnosis to determine which engine subsystem or component(s) caused the engine fault(s). Actual data collected by ship operators verify the proposed method’s efficiency, reliability, and accuracy.","","article","","213","","","Hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis of ship engine systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422018322","0957-4174","2023","118814","Expert Systems with Applications"

Further, the optical signal was analysed to extract the damage progression of defective idler with time and space. The results were used to classify various levels of damage and to set appropriate damage thresholds. Also, software interface, that can be used to set the sensing parameters, to collect, analyse, and visualise the signal in real-time, was developed. Finally, the developed condition monitoring system was used to monitor a 1.6 km long section of a conveyor structure in Western Australia for a period of 10 months.

In this regard, firstly, two different strategies such as the creation of the cylinder-basis model and the development of the overall system model are developed to determine the ANFIS model structure for the analysis. Then, comparative analyses are carried out to select a suitable ANFIS structure and its specific membership functions. In addition, the estimation process is also performed by the artificial neural network (ANN) model, and its results are compared with the findings of the best ANFIS structure.

Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of Hawaiʻi, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.","","article","","279","","","Submarine groundwater discharge detection through remote sensing: An application of Landsat 7 and 8 in Hawaiʻi and Ireland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722002231","0034-4257","2022","113109","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.","","article","","207","","","Vessel detection and classification from spaceborne optical images: A literature survey","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717306193","0034-4257","2018","1-26","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Furthermore, existing methods often directly remove after recognition, resulting in a significant loss of local information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an algorithm called Graph Signal Variation Detection (GSVD) to recognize and reconstruct tangles. Initially, data preprocessing is conducted to remove redundant and stationary points. Then, construct the vertices and edges of the graph using indicators integrating AIS data features and ship trajectories, respectively. The tangled region is identified by calculating the total variation theory of the graph. The tangled region is reconstructed using the greedy heuristic, and the optimal reconstruction path is determined by combining total variation quantization. Finally, the GSVD is compared with four prevailing methods, through qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results demonstrate that the GSVD surpasses the other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, recall rates, and false alarm rates. Additionally, the GSVD can effectively reconstruct the tangle.","","article","","286","","","Graph Signal Variation Detection: A novel approach for identifying and reconstructing ship AIS tangled trajectories","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002980182301836X","0029-8018","2023","115452","Ocean Engineering"

The objective of this study is to discuss on one hand, the intra annual and inter annual distribution of medicanes along with the composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic conditions and instability indices at the middle and lower troposphere, sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) as well, during medicane days, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data sets. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of medicane impacts over Mediterranean region with respect to period from 1969 to 2014, is illustrated by utilizing the Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The findings shed light on the high activity of medicanes during autumn and winter with maxima in September, decreasing thereafter with a long tail extending in spring and minimizing in summer. The average number of the selected medicanes is 1.4±1.3 events per year while their inter-annual variability is remarkable, although there is not any statistically significant trend (95% confidence level) within the examined period. We found from the analysis of the composite daily anomalies of the synoptic conditions that medicanes initiate and further develop in Mediterranean regions where cold air intrusions appear in the upper atmosphere associated with warm sea waters. Last but not least, the impacts of medicanes over coastal areas, including infrastructure damage and casualties due to associated strong winds, heavy rainfall, and in rare cases, tornadoes, are well presented, indicating the high concern of such extreme atmospheric phenomena should be given by stake holders towards resilience of the society.","","article","","208","","","Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones: Impacts and composite daily means and anomalies of synoptic patterns","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809517306130","0169-8095","2018","156-166","Atmospheric Research"

Therefore, the implementation of state-of-the-art inspection and maintenance activities are of paramount importance to adequately ensure the proper functioning of systems. Accordingly, Internet of Ships paradigm has emerged to guarantee the interconnectivity of maritime objects. Such technology is still in its infancy, and thus several challenges need to be addressed. An example of which is data preparation, critical to ensure data quality while avoiding biased results in further analysis to enhance transportation operations. As part of developing a real-time intelligent system to assist with instant decision-making strategies that enhance ship and systems availability, operability, and profitability, a data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery based on image generation and connected component analysis is proposed. The identification of such states is of preeminent importance, as non-operational states may adversely alter the results outlined. A case study of three diesel generators of a tanker ship is introduced to validate the developed framework. Results of this study demonstrated the outperformance of the proposed model in relation to the widely implemented clustering models k-means and GMMs with EM algorithm. As such, the proposed framework can adequately identify steady states appropriately to guarantee the detection of such states in real-time, whilst ensuring computational efficiency and model effectiveness.","","article","","121","","","A real-time data-driven framework for the identification of steady states of marine machinery","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118722000086","0141-1187","2022","103052","Applied Ocean Research"

In this paper, a self-supervised framework called the abnormal event detection network (AED-Net), which is composed of a principal component analysis network (PCAnet) and kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), is proposed to address this problem. Using surveillance video sequences of different scenes as raw data, the PCAnet is trained to extract high-level semantics of the crowd’s situation. Next, kPCA, a one-class classifier, is trained to identify anomalies within the scene. In contrast to some prevailing deep learning methods, this framework is completely self-supervised because it utilizes only video sequences of a normal situation. Experiments in global and local abnormal event detection are carried out on Monitoring Human Activity dataset from University of Minnesota (UMN dataset) and Anomaly Detection dataset from University of California, San Diego (UCSD dataset), and competitive results that yield a better equal error rate (EER) and area under curve (AUC) than other state-of-the-art methods are observed. Furthermore, by adding a local response normalization (LRN) layer, we propose an improvement to the original AED-Net. The results demonstrate that this proposed version performs better by promoting the framework’s generalization capacity.","","article","","5","","","AED-Net: An Abnormal Event Detection Network","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809918304880","2095-8099","2019","930-939","Engineering"

NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MODIS, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD550 up to 1.5–2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.","","article","","18","","","Meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest Asia: The role of pressure anomaly and Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone on the 1–3 July 2014 case","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875963715000609","1875-9637","2015","83-97","Aeolian Research"

This paper conducts a bibliometric review of the research on the risk, safety, and reliability of autonomous ships aiming to provide researchers and maritime stakeholders with a structured overview of the topics, development trends, and collaboration networks in this research field. 417 papers published between 2011 and 2022 were identified covering 940 authors, 31 countries, and 227 journals. Three main themes were determined in this research domain: “safety engineering and risk assessment for decision making”, “navigation safety and collision avoidance”, and “cybersecurity risk analysis”. Meanwhile, it was identified that research on cybersecurity in autonomous shipping is moving to overlap with safety, which requires future co-analysis methods. Additionally, the analysis of the most cited 30 papers suggests that further research is needed in the topics of unmanned machinery operation risks, online risk tools, system-theoretic safety analysis, human factor, and the determination of suitable risk acceptance criteria for safety assessment of autonomous ships. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the development of unambiguous COLREGs regulation is crucial for the development of safe collision avoidance algorithms for MASS.

To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper.

In this study, it is suggested to decompose the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region into clusters. Each cluster will contain trajectories with similar behavior characteristics. For each unique cluster, the method generates a local model to describe the local behavior in the cluster. In this manner, higher fidelity predictions can be facilitated compared to training a model on all available historical behavior. The study suggests to cluster historical trajectories using a variational recurrent autoencoder and the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm. The past behavior of a selected vessel is then classified to the most likely clusters of behavior based on the softmax distribution. Each local model consists of a sequence-to-sequence model with attention. When utilizing the deep learning framework, a user inputs the past trajectory of a selected vessel, and the framework outputs the most likely future trajectories.

Similar to conformal prediction, the choice of Nonconformity Measure (NCM) is of central importance for the classification performance of CAD and ICAD. A novel NCM for examples that are represented as sets of points is presented. One of the key properties of this NCM, which is known as the directed Hausdorff k-nearest neighbors (DH-kNN) NCM, is that the p-value for an incomplete test example monotonically decreases as more data points are observed.

In this period, dry conditions associated with the moderate El Niño event caused the largest regional biomass burning outbreak since 1997. Smoke emission in WRFchem is specified according to the Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) database derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. The modeled smoke transport pathway is found to be consistent with the MODIS true color images and measured mass concentration of surface PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10μm). The interplay of sea/land breezes, typhoons and storms over the subtropical western Pacific Ocean, trade winds, and topographic effects, can be clearly seen in the model simulation. The most severe smoke events in 1–5 October 2006 are found to be associated with the meteorological responses to the typhoon Xangsane (#18) over the western subtropical Pacific Ocean, which moved smoke from Sumatra eastward in the lower troposphere (below 700hPa), forming smoke layers mixed with and above the boundary layer clouds over Borneo. In contrast, the second largest week-long smoke transport event of 15–18 October 2006 was associated with the seasonal monsoonal transition period, during which smoke plumes were wide spread over the 5°S–5°N zone as a result of (a) the near surface divergence coupled with the 700hPa bifurcation of wind (flowing both to the west and to the east), and (b) the near-surface southeasterly and easterly winds along the equator transporting smoke from Borneo to Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Analysis of data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) shows that smoke particles in October 2006 were primarily located within 3.5km above the surface. Smoke particles contributed roughly half of the total aerosol extinction retrieved by CALIOP. Results suggest that the smoke injection height in the model should be set lower than the 2–5km commonly used in transport simulations; smoke release at ~0.8km instead of 2km above surface gives a consistently better match to CALIOP observations. Numerical experiments further show that the Titiwangsa Mountains in Malaysia Peninsula and Tama Abu Mountains in Borneo have significant impacts on smoke transport and the surface air quality in the vicinity.","","article","","122","","","Mesoscale modeling of smoke transport over the Southeast Asian Maritime Continent: Interplay of sea breeze, trade wind, typhoon, and topography","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016980951200138X","0169-8095","2013","486-503","Atmospheric Research"

These climate boundaries are not stationary and shift geographically, depending on long-term atmospheric conditions. So far, little is known about past shifts of these climate boundaries and the local to regional environmental response prior to the instrumental era. High resolution multi-proxy data (stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, S/Ca and Sr/Ca) from two Holocene stalagmites from Bleßberg Cave (Thuringia) are used here to differentiate local and pan-regional environmental and climatic conditions Central Germany through the Holocene. Carbon isotope and S/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios inform us on local Holocene environmental changes in and around the cave, while δ18O (when combined with independent records) serves as proxy for (pan-)regional atmospheric conditions. The stable carbon isotope record suggests repeated changes in vegetation density (open vs. dense forest), and increasing forest cover in the late Holocene. Concurrently, decreasing S/Ca values indicate more effective sulfur retention in better developed soils, with a stabilization in the mid-Holocene. This goes in hand with changes in effective summer infiltration, reflected in the Sr/Ca profile. Highest Sr/Ca values between 4 ka and 1 ka BP indicate intensified prior calcite precipitation resulting from reduced effective moisture supply. The region of Bleßberg Cave is sensitive to shifts of the boundary between maritime (Cfb) and continental (Dfb) climate and ideally suited to reconstruct past meridional shifts of this divide. We combined the Bleßberg Cave δ18O time series with δ18O data from Bunker Cave (western Germany) and a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) record from lake SS1220 (SW Greenland) to reconstruct the mean position of the Cfb-Dfb climate boundary. We further estimate the dynamic interplay of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Siberian High and their influence on Central European climate. Repeated shifts of the Cfb-Dfb boundary over the last 4000 years might explain previously observed discrepancies between proxy records from Europe. Detailed correlation analyses reveal multi-centennial scale alternations of maritime and continental climate and, concurrently, waning and waxing influences of Siberian High and NAO on Central Europe.","","article","","176","","","Holocene interaction of maritime and continental climate in Central Europe: New speleothem evidence from Central Germany","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092181811830657X","0921-8181","2019","144-161","Global and Planetary Change"

Monitoring and evaluating large-scale glacier and snow (GS) mass changes are critical for humans and ecosystems. Although modern gravity satellites monitor GS on a global scale, the contemporary Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow−On (GRACE−FO) missions are only able to do so at coarse spatial resolutions and are restricted by their limited observation periods. Moreover, because of the complex mechanism behind a glacier's mass balance, existing reconstruction methods for GRACE-like mass anomalies, including machine learning approaches and statistical models, cannot be applied to HMGs. Here, we propose a precipitation and temperature data-driven statistical model combining hydrology and GS processes to reconstruct GRACE-like mass anomalies of HMGs, from which the hydrological and GS signals can be further separated. The prediction and reconstruction performance of this method was consistent with the GRACE/GRACE−FO observations (the median correlation coefficient/Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency: ~0.92/0.85). Additionally, the separated GS signals agreed with the independent external data used for comparison. Compared with machine learning methods, this method better reconstructed the long-term trend of GRACE-like mass anomalies. Our study provides an acceptable method for expanding mass anomaly time series on HMGs, thereby assisting in the sustainable management and protection of water resources in their downstream areas.","","article","","280","","","Reconstructing GRACE-like time series of high mountain glacier mass anomalies","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722002899","0034-4257","2022","113177","Remote Sensing of Environment"

It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.","","article","","175","","","AIS data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554523001400","1366-5545","2023","103152","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review"

The characteristics of influences of most influencing parameters on the detectability are established. However, a consequent investigation and systematization of influences regarding differences in settings of various SARs have not been published. In this study, data from four different SARs missions, namely TerraSAR–X (TSX), CosmoSkymed (CSK), Sentinel–1 (S1) and RADARSAT–2 (RS2), were collected and analyzed with focus on detectability of ship wake components. The sensors operate on different orbit altitudes and radar frequency bands: TSX and CSK work with X–Band, S1 and RS2 work with C–Band. Using methods from the field of Data Science, the detectability of wake components is modelled for each of the four sensors using machine leaning by the support vector machine (SVM) method. The created SVM-models are then compared in order to derive statements regarding relative detectability of individual wake components. A measure of detectability model’s uncertainty and an alternative analysis based on accumulated backscattering statistics is presented to support the derived statements. In conclusion, sensors with shorter slant ranges and X–Band in comparison to C–Band were found to be better suited for the detection of ship wakes. However, these characteristics only hold for wake components detectable due to the Bragg scattering mechanism, i.e. Kelvin wake arms and V-narrow wakes. No significant difference for near and far field of turbulent wakes is recognized.","","article","","196","","","Comparison of detectability of ship wake components between C-Band and X-Band synthetic aperture radar sensors operating under different slant ranges","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271622003239","0924-2716","2023","306-324","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing"

Meanwhile, based on the characteristics of small targets with compact gray levels and a certain contrast with its surrounding background, the MSER-induced local saliency measure (MLSM) is designed to reliably enlarge the target signal and remove strong clutter interferences.

The proposed model consists of an encoder-decoder-based RE-DFP network to improve positioning accuracy and data efficiency and a RAD network to analyze environmental dynamics according to APs. In the proposed RE-DFP, a CNN-based encoder is applied to increase efficiency by minimizing the dependence of the radio map, and the position is estimated through an LSTM-based decoder. RAD identifies the AP, which is the cause of the change in the radio map and excludes it from the online phase, preventing a decrease in positioning accuracy. Simultaneously, the proposed model collects the RSSI of the identified AP through crowdsourcing and reconstructs the radio map by itself, enabling a seamless positioning service in the online phase.","","article","","192","","","Automatic self-reconstruction model for radio map in Wi-Fi fingerprinting","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421017395","0957-4174","2022","116455","Expert Systems with Applications"

Traditionally, the inverse modeling (IM) approach, usually a slow and computationally intensive process, is used for detecting targets using surface reflectance spectra. For the emerging online methods in remote sensing, modeling the at-sensor radiance of target material, i.e., a forward modeling (FM) approach, can be used. Compared to the IM approach, FM is better suited to online methods due to its potential for adaptation to regional atmospheric modeling. Spectral knowledge transfer of a target from a known to an unknown atmospheric condition is the primary outcome of an efficient target detection framework. However, such an endeavor requires an exhaustive assessment of the target detection process under different atmospheric models and associated uncertainties. The objective of this work is to assess the quantitative impact of atmospheric parameters on the detectability of engineered targets. Specifically, the impact of critical atmospheric parameters such as aerosol optical thickness (AOT), standard atmospheric profiles, and aerosol models are considered. For this effect, we designed a multi-platform image acquisition setup that acquired targets concurrently using a ground-based terrestrial hyperspectral imager (THI), an airborne hyperspectral imager (AVIRIS-NG), and a space-borne multispectral imager (Sentinel-2). We used a point-based spectroradiometer and pixel-based THI to collect the in-situ reference target reflectance spectra and generated a radiance spectral library by simulating TOA radiance spectra using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. We have considered two cases of target radiance simulations, i.e., (i) corresponding to a grid of different AOT values for a predefined atmospheric and aerosol profile, and (ii) corresponding to varying combinations of atmospheric and aerosol profiles at a given AOT. The detection has been carried out using multiple target detection algorithms. Results indicate that the spectral knowledge-based targets can be detected in remote sensing data under different atmospheric model scenarios using the FM approach. A detection rate of about 75% and 50% have been consistently obtained for remote sensing data from airborne and space-borne platforms with a false alarm (FA) rate of 10-2 to 10-3 respectively. Change in the AOT across atmospheric models has resulted in decision-changing implications in the target detection modeling. The selection of the wrong atmospheric profile can potentially aggravate the number of FAs produced by a particular detection algorithm.","","article","","183","","","Influence of atmospheric modeling on spectral target detection through forward modeling approach in multi-platform remote sensing data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271621003099","0924-2716","2022","286-306","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing"

However, when dealing with repeat aeromagnetic survey data, the problem of how to extract the real change of magnetic anomalies from a limited set of observations arises, i.e. the problem of spatial aliasing. Recent development of the generalized mis-tie control method for aeromagnetic surveys flown at variable elevations enables us to statistically extract the errors from ambiguous noise sources. This technique can be applied to overcome the spatial alias effect when detecting magnetic anomaly changes between aeromagnetic surveys flown at different times. We successfully apply this technique to Asama Volcano, one of the active volcanoes in Japan, which erupted in 2004. Following the volcanic activity in 2005, we conducted a helicopter-borne aeromagnetic survey, which we compare here to the result from a previous survey flown in 1992. To discuss small changes in magnetic anomalies induced by volcanic activity, it is essential to estimate the accuracy of the reference and the repeat aeromagnetic measurements and the probable errors induced by data processing. In our case, the positioning inaccuracy of the 1992 reference survey was the most serious factor affecting the estimation of the magnetic anomaly change because GPS was still in an early stage at that time. However, our analysis revealed that the magnetic anomaly change over the Asama Volcano area from 1992 to 2005 exceeded the estimated error at three locations, one of which is interpreted as a loss of magnetization induced by volcanic activity. In this study, we suffered from the problem of positioning inaccuracy in the 1992 survey data, and it was important to evaluate its effect when deriving the magnetic anomaly change.","","article","","478","","","Detection of aeromagnetic anomaly change associated with volcanic activity: An application of the generalized mis-tie control method","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195109000936","0040-1951","2009","3-18","Tectonophysics"

We found strong correlations between REE and Th, indicating detrital origin. Despite strong Eh gradients, the Th-normalized redox-sensitive elements (e.g., Eu, Ce, Fe, As, and others) showed little variability within the sedimentary environment. The exceptions were U (depleted in the upper few centimeters) and Br (enriched in the upper few centimeters). While U appears to be removed from seawater via uptake across the boundary of reducing sediments, the mechanisms driving Br accumulation are unclear, but perhaps related to increasing diatom production driven by regional warming. A comparison with published concentrations from rocks representing the regional eroding units showed that the characteristics of source rock could be recognized in the REE fractionation patterns in our sediments.

Then 12 characteristic anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (nodes) are identified. The composites of temperature and precipitation anomalies as well as vertical wind anomalies at 500-hPa level assigned to each node are generated and visualized. The spatial distributions of anomalous geopotential height (anticyclones or cyclones) are highly consistent with that of surface air temperature anomalies in both winter and summer. Most precipitation extremes in winter are attributed to the joint effect of the horizontal and vertical atmospheric motions, while strong air convection is prone to inducing extreme precipitation events in summer. Based on the SOM classification, the differences of atmospheric circulations, temperature and precipitation anomalies have also been partly identified in strong and weak phases of East Asia Monsoon.","","article","","232","","","Relating anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns to temperature and precipitation anomalies in the East Asian monsoon region","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809519302339","0169-8095","2020","104679","Atmospheric Research"

In addition to the loss of energy production following a prolonged shutdown, the various maintenance costs represent an undesirable effect due to unanticipated failure. One of the main functions of a condition-based maintenance (CBM), is the early detection of any unexpected changes in a machine behavior. Indeed, being able to detect any drift or change in behavior compared to a reference behavior represents a major challenge in the monitoring of complex machines like a HTGU. In this paper, an early anomaly detection model for HTGU using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL) is proposed. The combined reconstruction error thus obtained from the VAE-SDL model is used as an early fault detection. Experimental tests on vibratory signals show that the two models thus joined increase the sensitivity as well as the robustness of the anomaly detection.","","article","","120","","","Hydrogenerator early fault detection: Sparse Dictionary Learning jointly with the Variational Autoencoder","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095219762300043X","0952-1976","2023","105859","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence"

Besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory, topic modeling popular in the field of Natural Language Processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents. This paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model. A coarse-grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words. A motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features (location, course and speed). All ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus. A classic topic model (i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at Wuhan waterway, located at middle stream of Yangtze River in China.","","article","","201","","","Mobility pattern analysis of ship trajectories based on semantic transformation and topic model","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801820301633","0029-8018","2020","107092","Ocean Engineering"

Most existing deep learning methods rely only on single-scale high-level features and ignore the correlations of the pixels in intra-image and inter-image. Due to this limitation, previous methods are considered unsuitable for multi-scale splicing forgery detection. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model for improving multi-scale splicing forged regions localization by utilizing multi-level multi-scale feature enhancement and pixel-level supervised contrastive learning. First, we introduce a multi-level multi-scale feature enhancement module (MFEM) to integrate the multi-level information and capture the multi-scale global contextual representation by embedding an improved atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) mechanism into the non-local module. It strengthens the capability of the model to sense multi-scale tampered regions. Second, the pixel-level supervised contrastive learning mechanism is designed to separately cluster the pixel representations of tampered and real regions within and across images. It improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of the pixel embedding space significantly and enhances feature expression capabilities. Third, we design a multi-loss progressive learning (MPL) strategy to integrate the complementary advantages of multi-loss functions to optimize the scale and position parameters of the tampered regions during the training process. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It can effectively detect and segment multi-scale tampered regions, even for noisy and JPEG-compressed images.","","article","","136","","","Feature enhancement and supervised contrastive learning for image splicing forgery detection","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051200423001008","1051-2004","2023","104005","Digital Signal Processing"

Detection and mapping of vegetation remains limited in the Antarctic environment given the complexity of its surface coverage. Some cryptogamic species exhibit low reflectance in the near-infrared region and are not easily detected by vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, spectral reflectance of Antarctic vegetation is highly variable according to seasonal conditions, which may influence NDVI results. As ultra-high resolution aerial imagery allows for a detailed analysis of vegetation and enables the validation of satellite imagery, in this study we assess the ability of the NDVI from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to identify vegetated areas in the ice-free environment of Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. NDVI classification with class ranges set by statistical parameters (i.e., mean and standard deviation) is performed. The results show that different sensors provide different NDVI values for the same vegetation class. NDVI classification enabled the identification of areas showing vegetation cover, which are in accordance with the manually mapped areas in the UAV image. Correspondence in vegetation distribution and classes can be observed across all classifications, demonstrating that aerial and satellite imagery may be used for Antarctic vegetation monitoring. A close association between NDVI classes and Antarctic vegetation type is identified, where lichens are generally classified in lower probability classes, and algae and moss in higher probability classes. This article shows the potential of NDVI applied to Antarctic vegetation and the significance of data statistical parameters in the selection of thresholds, reducing the need for ground-truth information in remote areas.","","article","","125","","","Evaluation of UAV and satellite-derived NDVI to map maritime Antarctic vegetation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622819313554","0143-6228","2020","102322","Applied Geography"

In this context, the magnetic network fills the gaps of sonar systems at the critical boundaries of the water volume to be controlled (sea bed, docks, …), where acoustic performances deteriorate due to reflections and attenuations. The system operates in a port-protection scenario, characterized by a medium-high environmental magnetic noise that can hide the diver signal (a diver is a weak, quasi-point-like, moving source). The magnetometer network processes two inputs: the environmental magnetic noise and a signal including the target magnetic signal superimposed to the same noise; the frequencies of a diver signal lie within the noise band, hence frequency filtering proves inadequate for noise removal. The basic idea underlying the system is to measure and use the noise itself to filter the overall signal; measuring noise supports a background-subtraction process that allows to extract the target signal and therefore detect the threat presence. The effectiveness of the procedure depends on the positions of magnetometers: sensors must be close enough to one another to measure the common background noise, and, at the same time, should be distant enough from one another so that just one sensor can measure the target signal. To generate alarms when a threat is detected, a real-time software application processes data and activates a visual and acoustic alarm upon identification of a magnetic anomaly. Sea trials carried out in port areas provided extremely satisfactory results in the detection of intruders.

A dynamic ship domain model that considers the preferences of navigators with respect to the distance passing with other ships before and after the collision avoidance action is first built as the basis of conflict detection modelling. Then a ship domain-based conflict severity model is established to evaluate the risk levels of ships being involved in dangerous encounters. The spatial-temporal pattern mining methods are subsequently extended to identify collision risk Hot-Spots and analyze the collision risk cluster features with time of day. A case study is finally performed using the real AIS data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port area.

The security concerns in IoMT data are therefore very high. The attackers may inject malware into the IoMT data during its transmission. If the health parameters are affected by malware it may mislead the medical experts in making inferences about the patient’s health. IoMT devices are resource-constrained and require faster analysis of data for better medical assistance. Most of the classification techniques used earlier suffer from exhaustive time and resource consumption. Hence, developing an intelligent framework that could reduce the data size and classify the malware quickly is essential. This paper proposes a deep learning framework called Auto-encoder to encode the IoMT data. The encoded features are then given to an XGBoost Classifier whose hyperparameters are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm. XGBoost Classifier detects the presence of malware in the IoMT dataset and Clamp dataset with an accuracy of 98.98% and 98.69% respectively. This lightweight model achieves dimensionality reduction through Autoencoder and effectively detects malware through an optimized XGBoost classifier with faster convergence and limited computational costs. Implementing this framework on the fog layer provides promising results by optimizing resource usage and saving time compared to previous works.

Multiple current and planned satellite missions are designed to quantify atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on a global scale, but most of these sensors do not have the spatial resolution necessary to resolve point sources such as fossil fuel power plants. Airborne imaging spectrometer data, such as those from the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), can have multiple, contiguous bands covering shortwave infrared (SWIR) absorption features produced by carbon dioxide. Therefore, high spatial resolution data from AVIRIS-like sensors may offer a means for detecting plumes and retrieving carbon dioxide concentrations for point source emissions. The objectives of this study include modeling minimum carbon dioxide anomalies detectable in AVIRIS data under different conditions and applying a Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter for detection of carbon dioxide plumes in simulated data and in AVIRIS images acquired over power plants. Radiative transfer simulations were used to model the residual radiance produced by increased absorption by carbon dioxide as concentration was elevated above background levels within a 0–500m layer. Carbon dioxide anomalies, surface reflectance, water vapor concentration, solar zenith angle, sensor height, and aerosol scattering were varied in simulation sets and the resulting residual radiance spectra were compared against noise equivalent delta radiance (NEdL) for the “classic” and “next generation” AVIRIS instruments. Sensitivity to carbon dioxide anomalies improved with increased surface reflectance and declined with increased water vapor concentration, solar zenith angle, sensor height, and aerosol scattering. Zero to 500m concentration anomalies as low as 100 parts per milion by volume (ppm) for AVIRIS C and 25ppm for AVIRIS NG produced residual radiance values that exceeded SWIR NEdL. Carbon dioxide concentrations modeled for a generic power plant emissions scenario using a plume dispersion model were combined with randomly-generated reflectance spectra to create simulated images with varying surface reflectance and NEdL. For these simulated images, true positive and false positive detection rates improved as background reflectance increased and as NEdL decreased. Apparent plumes were detected in all four AVIRIS C images acquired over power plants, although the characteristics of the plumes varied according to solar-plume-sensor geometry. Improvements in modeling may allow retrieval of plume concentration, providing a valuable means for quantifying point source emissions and a basis for comparison with column concentrations retrieved from in situ measurements and coarse resolution satellite data.","","article","","139","","","High spatial resolution mapping of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide using airborne imaging spectroscopy: Radiative transfer modeling and power plant plume detection","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425713002599","0034-4257","2013","116-129","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Faulting disrupts the smoothness trend of geological layers (reflections in seismic sections) and displaces layers along its plane. Thus, a fault could be considered as an abnormal phenomenon that globally deviates normal behavior of layers around its plane. In the present study, faults are considered as sparse global anomalies in a seismic section that can be extracted using Gaussian process regression. The Gaussian process regression is a nonparametric probabilistic model based on Bayesian statistics that can be used to model spatial properties as a regression problem. The Gaussian process usually is used to extract and describe normal interactions from the data set using smooth functions. The main idea of this study is to detect the global anomaly using Gaussian process regression. For this purpose, we considered geological layers as smooth normal events in seismic sections. Therefore, the location of the fault plane is where the Gaussian process gets an error during describing the layers. Abnormalities such as faults cause the Gaussian process to suffer an error near the anomaly. We used these errors and analyzed them to detect probable locations of fault edge. Finally, we used a consistent connection algorithm to separate most probable fault points and to connect them to an edge using morphological reconstruction algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Several synthetic seismic sections with different levels of signal to noise ratios were used to evaluate the algorithm in the presence of random noise. The results showed that all points predicted by a diagnostic test fell into the area above the diagonal of the receiver operating characteristics space, which represents a good diagnostic classification.","","article","","163","","","Automatic fault detection in seismic data using Gaussian process regression","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985118301964","0926-9851","2019","117-131","Journal of Applied Geophysics"

Increases in maritime traffic, however, lead to increased congestion in berths and terminals. This congestion in turn negatively affects the total ship turnaround time and leads to decreased efficiency in port operations and a higher demurrage rate, which refers to the number of vessels in queue for more than a fixed time period waiting to load/unload out of the total number of vessels entering a port. The demurrage rate directly affects a port’s operating profits; thus, this rate needs to stay as low as possible. In this study, we focus on developing a methodology to address the demurrage rate of a port. To this end, we first collect two sets of vessel data (2016 annual data for training and 2019 annual data for validating) for ships entering and leaving the Port of Ulsan in the Republic of Korea and integrate these datasets with berth data and weather data. We tailor the logical analysis of data (LAD) technique to derive the patterns from the training data that mitigate or aggravate the demurrage rate. We use these patterns to predict the demurrage rate for the validating set of data. The overall binary classification results demonstrate the proposed LAD technique’s competitive performance, compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We then analyze the patterns to derive policy suggestions that can lower the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Our computational experiments find that the availability of tugs or pilots and port arrival times mainly affect the demurrage rate at the Port of Ulsan. Finally, our study showcases new possibilities for using patterns of demurrage and non-demurrage vessels obtained by LAD to help policymakers and port operators address the growing demurrage problem.","","article","","206","","","Demurrage pattern analysis using logical analysis of data: A case study of the Ulsan Port Authority","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422010260","0957-4174","2022","117745","Expert Systems with Applications"

It is shown that smoke transport pathways are closely related to the low-level atmospheric flow, i.e., during June–Sept, smoke originating from the MC islands with a dominant source over central and southern Sumatra, and southern and western Borneo, is generally transported northwestward south of the equator and northeastward north of the equator with the cross-equatorial flow, to the South China Sea (SCS), the Philippines and even further to the western Pacific. During the October–November transitional period, smoke transport paths are more zonally oriented compared to June–September. Smoke originating from Java, Bali, Timor etc, and southern New Guinea, which are in the domain of easterlies and southeasterlies during the boreal summer (June–November), is generally transported westward. It is also found that smoke transport over the MC exhibits multi-scale variability. Smoke typically lives longer and can be transported farther in El Niño years and later MJO phases compared with non El Niño years and earlier MJO phases. During El Niño periods there is much stronger westward transport to the east tropical Indian Ocean. Finally, orographic effect on smoke transport over the MC is also clearly discernable.","","article","","122","","","Smoke aerosol transport patterns over the Maritime Continent","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809512001354","0169-8095","2013","469-485","Atmospheric Research"

The estimation accuracy and efficiency are assured by employing a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, which provides the quantitative bounds on the approximation accuracy and allows for a fast estimation of conflict criticality. Several real experiments are conducted using the AIS-based trajectory data in Ningbo-Zhoushan Port to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed new approach.

A substandard ship can be detained in an inspection if serious deficiencies are found onboard. Ship detention is regarded as a severe result in port state control inspection. However, developing accurate prediction models for ship detention based on ship’s generic factors (e.g. ship age, type, and flag), dynamic factors (e.g. times of ship flag changes), and inspection historical factors (e.g. total previous detentions in PSC inspection, last PSC inspection time, and last deficiency number in PSC inspection) before an inspection is conducted is not a trivial task as the low detention rate leads to a highly imbalanced inspection records dataset. To address this issue, this paper develops a classification model called balanced random forest (BRF) to predict ship detention by using 1,600 inspection records at the Hong Kong port for three years. Numerical experiments show that the proposed BRF model can identify 81.25% of all the ships with detention in the test set which contains another 400 inspection records. Compared with the current ship selection method at the Hong Kong port, the BRF model is much more efficient and can achieve an average improvement of 73.72% in detained ship identification.","","article","","48","","","An Artificial Intelligence Model Considering Data Imbalance for Ship Selection in Port State Control Based on Detention Probabilities","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187775032030555X","1877-7503","2021","101257","Journal of Computational Science"

The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.","","article","","66","","","Change detection support for supervisory controllers of highly automated systems: Effects on performance, mental workload, and recovery of situation awareness following interruptions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169814117300136","0169-8141","2018","75-84","International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics"

Nevertheless, the increased connectivity in terms of both wired and wireless links and associated attack surfaces that comes along, requires higher security for safeguarding critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cyberattacks. In this rapidly evolving ecosystem, security testbeds have emerged as a versatile, cost-effective solution for investigating potential attack vectors and devising appropriate countermeasures, without putting the real system at risk. The present work seeks to address a prominent literature gap, namely, the lack of a systematic review regarding the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS. We contribute an overarching, manifold review on this topic from 2016 onward, examining the various literature works from diverse angles, namely, the wireless technologies used, the implemented attacks, the employed security controls, and more. The analysis is done on a per-sector basis, including water and wastewater systems, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, energy, maritime, unmanned aircraft systems, and others. Finally yet importantly, we discuss key takeaways, open issues, and challenges. The key observations of our analysis, including almost 50 articles, can be wrapped up into two salient points: on the one hand, wireless technologies are increasingly penetrating into the CPS domain as an orthogonal, versatile solution to their wired counterparts, but on the other, they widen the window of opportunity for threat actors targeting wireless links. In this context, testbed thoroughness and security as a trade-off seem to be of major importance, alongside a modular, possibly sector-neutral reference architecture that overarches the peculiarities of CPS. Overall, to our knowledge, this work provides the first full-fledged survey on the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS, and it is therefore anticipated to serve as a groundwork and touchstone for several stakeholders at different levels.","","article","","133","","","A systematic literature review on wireless security testbeds in the cyber-physical realm","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823002936","0167-4048","2023","103383","Computers & Security"

However, soared up human activities, man-made constructions, and marine traffics negatively interfere and affect the reliability of observations and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of using satellite winds for many applications, such as offshore wind energy, even though Sentinel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is freely and easily accessible. In this paper, we presented a novel methodological framework for localization and suppression of anomalous pixels (APs), which deteriorate the confidence and accuracy of the retrieved SAR wind speeds. The backbone of the implementation relied on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, one of the automatic target recognition algorithms. We used a large dataset of SAR subscenes to model different sea clutter conditions after removing the potential targets. We selected the suitable distribution model that maintains a constant probability of false alarm (pfa) for the entire SAR scene. The proper pfa was optimized in various SAR scenes ranging from scenes with a considerable number of APs, such as ships and wind park clusters, to scenes with no visible APs under different wind speed conditions. The pfa optimization process prevented real wind pixels from being misidentified as APs. Applying CFAR to the logarithmic scale of raw digital numbers (log-DNs) domain with a pfa of about 3.17 × 10-5, we extracted SAR wind speeds around each ocean buoy before and after CFAR process, comparing them with their corresponding in situ wind measurements. This led to significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of SAR wind data retrieval, especially in regions with numerous man-made constructions and high marine traffics. We tested and validated our approach in the North Sea and two regions along the eastern coast of the U.S. The enclosed region, serving as a marine route for harbors in Delaware Bay, showed a substantial improvement in RMSE and BIAS after applying our approach, reducing RMSE from 2.4 m/s to 1.6 m/s and the BIAS from −1.5 m/s to −0.3 m/s. The open ocean region demonstrated stable RMSE and BIAS, indicating preservation of real wind data, as only APs affecting SAR wind speed were considered during the process.","","article","","122","","","Improving SAR wind retrieval through automatic anomalous pixel detection","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843223002686","1569-8432","2023","103444","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation"

The effects of shallow water depths, different sediment types, recording speed and different (2D and 3D) sub-bottom profiler systems are briefly discussed. It is concluded that Chirps are well suited for survey purposes, producing high quality 2D profiles of good resolution and satisfactory penetration depth. Furthermore, the equipment is easy to handle from a small boat and allows flexible sailing. This type of 2D data is cheaper and faster to acquire and is easier to interpret and apparently also provides better resolution and detail than present 3D systems. Chirp data are therefore of great value in identifying and outlining shipwrecks hidden in the sea floor in survey situations where larger areas must be covered.

Quality-screened and cloud-cleared Version 3.01 Level 2 NASA Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 5-km Aerosol Profile datasets are analyzed from 2007 to 2009. Numerical simulations from the U.S. Naval Aerosol Analysis and Predictive System (NAAPS), featuring two-dimensional variational assimilation of NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer quality-assured datasets, combined with regional ground-based lidar measurements, are considered for assessing CALIOP retrieval performance, identifying bias, and evaluating regional representativeness. CALIOP retrievals of aerosol particle extinction coefficient and aerosol optical depth (AOD) are high over land and low over open waters relative to NAAPS (0.412/0.312 over land for all data points inclusive, 0.310/0.235 when the per bin average is used and each is treated as single data points; 0.102/0.151 and 0.086/0.124, respectively, over ocean). Regional means, however, are very similar (0.180/0.193 for all data points and 0.155/0.159 when averaged per normalized bin), as the two factors offset one another. The land/ocean offset is investigated, and discrepancies attributed to interpretation of particle composition and a-priori assignment of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio (“lidar ratio”) necessary for retrieving the extinction coefficient from CALIOP signals. Over land, NAAPS indicates more dust present than CALIOP algorithms are identifying, indicating a likely assignment of a higher lidar ratio representative of more absorptive particles. NAAPS resolves more smoke over water than identified with CALIOP, indicating likely usage of a lidar ratio characteristic of less absorptive particles to be applied that biases low AOD there. Over open waters except within the Bay of Bengal, aerosol particle scattering is largely capped below 1.5km MSL, though ground-based lidar measurements at Singapore differ slightly from this finding. Significant aerosol particle presence over land is similarly capped near 3.0km MSL over most regions. Particle presence at low levels regionally, except over India, is dominated by relatively non-depolarizing particles. Industrial haze, sea salt droplets and fresh smoke are thus most likely present.","","article","","122","","","Characterizing the vertical profile of aerosol particle extinction and linear depolarization over Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent: The 2007–2009 view from CALIOP","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809512001366","0169-8095","2013","520-543","Atmospheric Research"

Machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) have good protection capabilities. However, it is difficult to identify attack information in massive amounts of data, which leads to inefficient model detection when faced with insufficient samples for certain types of attacks. In this regard, this paper fuses deep learning methods and statistical ideas to address the problem of minority samples attack detection, and proposes an intrusion detection method for the IoT based on Improved Conditional Variational Autoencoder (ICVAE) and Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (BSM), called ICVAE-BSM. By introducing an auxiliary network into the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to adjust the output probability distribution of the encoder, learning the posterior distribution of different classes of samples, so that the distributions of samples of the same class are concentrated, and the distributions of different classes of samples are scattered in the latent space; then based on BSM, adaptively synthesize the edge latent variables in the latent space of ICVAE, and feed the new synthetic edge latent variables to the ICVAE’s decoder to generate representative new samples to balance the data set. The output of the encoder is connected to the Softmax classifier at last, and the original samples are mixed with the generated samples to fine-tune it to enhance its generalization ability for intrusion detection of minority samples. We use the NSL-KDD data set, CIC-IDS2017 data set and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data set to simulate and evaluate the model, the experimental results show that the proposed method can more effectively improve the accuracy of IoT attack detection under the condition of unbalanced samples.","","article","","133","","","On IoT intrusion detection based on data augmentation for enhancing learning on unbalanced samples","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X22000826","0167-739X","2022","213-227","Future Generation Computer Systems"

Abiotic methylation processes also play an important role, with up to 0.54 ± 0.43% of added Hg converted instantaneously to MMHg. These results suggest that Deception Island presents favourable conditions for MMHg explaining the elevated concentrations of both THg and MMHg in this ecosystem.","","article","","164","","","Mercury methylation rates in Deception Island (Maritime Antarctica) waters and pyroclastic gravel impacted by volcanic mercury","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X21000576","0025-326X","2021","112023","Marine Pollution Bulletin"

Although scientists all over the world have made great efforts to understand and predict climatic variations, there are still several major problems for improving climate prediction. In 2020, the Center for Climate System Prediction Research (CCSP) was established with support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China. CCSP aims to tackle three scientific problems related to climate prediction—namely, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prediction, extended-range weather forecasting, and interannual-to-decadal climate prediction—and hence provide a solid scientific basis for more reliable climate predictions and disaster prevention. In this paper, the major objectives and scientific challenges of CCSP are reported, along with related achievements of its research groups in monsoon dynamics, land–atmosphere interaction and model development, ENSO variability, intraseasonal oscillation, and climate prediction. CCSP will endeavor to tackle key scientific problems in these areas. 摘要 过去几十年, 气候变化和极端气候事件造成的经济损失和灾害显著增加. 虽然全球的科学家在理解和预测气候变异方面做出了巨大的努力, 但当前在气候预测领域仍然存在几个重大难题. 2020年, 依托于国家自然科学基金基础科学中心项目的气候系统预测研究中心 (CCSP) 成立了, 该中心旨在应对和处理气候预测领域的三大科学难题: 厄尔尼诺-南方涛动 (ENSO) 预测, 延伸期天气预报, 年际-年代际气候预测, 并为更加准确的气候预测和更加有效的灾害防御提供科学依据. 因此, 本文介绍了CCSP的主要目标和面对的科学挑战, 回顾了CCSP在季风动力过程, 陆-气相互作用和模式开发, ENSO变率, 季节内振荡, 气候预测等方面已取得的重要研究成果. 未来CCSP将继续致力于解决上述领域的关键科学问题.","","article","","15","","","Predicting climate anomalies: A real challenge","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674283421000945","1674-2834","2022","100115","Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters"

Text-based machine learning techniques often rely purely on word frequency analysis to eliminate the innate subjectivity of human language, but more refined techniques like structural topic modeling (STM) attempt to simulate text generation to identify the thematic undertones of text corpora. This paper presents an application of STM to two text-based sets of aviation safety data, the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) and accident and incident reports published by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). A framework for cleaning and pre-processing the datasets is discussed, including a brief discussion of bag-of-words and TF–IDF representations of narratives. The methodology behind STM is described, including techniques for selecting the optimal number of topics. The results of the STM analysis on the ASRS and NTSB datasets are presented, with a focus on the clarity and specificity based on most common words associated with topics. A brief exploration of the correlation between pairs of topic labels is also undertaken, including a visualization of narratives in 2-dimensional space. STM is found to show promise in identifying themes within technical datasets, with model performance increasing for more specific corpora that use precise and unique language.","","article","","224","","","Application of structural topic modeling to aviation safety data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832022001776","0951-8320","2022","108522","Reliability Engineering & System Safety"

Quantitative stratigraphic analyses of bulk sediment composition, texture (% sand and coarse organic detritus), the C/N ratio of bulk organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility allowed us to define a common succession of sedimentary units in all three lakes. This common stratigraphy includes a basal unit of dry and stiff low-organic clays capped by a horizon of peaty mud or peat, overlain by organic lake sediment. We interpret this stratigraphy to represent an episode of (nearly) complete desiccation of these lake basins. This was followed first by an early phase of modest lake refilling, during which time extensive littoral and submerged vegetation developed, producing peaty lake deposits. Mostly higher lake levels later on resulted in deposition of fine-grained lake muds. Using 210Pb and 137Cs activity profiles combined with four AMS 14C dates on single terrestrial plant macrofossils or multiple charred grass particles indicate that in all three lakes the episode of most recent complete desiccation occurred in the late 18th and early 19th century. These results add to an accumulating body of palaeoenvironmental data revealing a prolonged period of extreme drought in equatorial East Africa about 200 years ago, also documented in the cultural history of the African Great Lakes region. Given the geographical spread of the study lakes across the East African plateau, these results indicate that the climatic anomaly of reduced rainfall responsible for this drought was at least sub-continental in scale.","","article","","259","","","Palaeolimnological evidence for widespread late 18th century drought across equatorial East Africa","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018207005056","0031-0182","2008","107-120","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

Natural ClO4− is formed in the atmosphere and enters into the surface environment through deposition. However, the knowledge on the occurrence, spatial variability and sinks of natural ClO4− in different environments remains limited, especially in the polar regions. Here, we investigate the sources and sinks of ClO4− in soil collected in three ice-free areas in coastal Antarctica, where the research stations and wildlife colonies are mainly distributed. No statistically significant difference in ClO4− concentrations between sites near and away from the stations suggests that local human presence is not a significant source of ClO4− in soil. Concentrations of ClO4− in soil from wildlife colonies are not significantly higher than those from sites with no intense wildlife activities, indicating that wildlife activities have no significant influences on ClO4− in soil. Thus, atmospherically formed ClO4− is the main source for soil in Antarctica. In general, ClO4− concentrations (0.1–5.1 μg kg−1) in soil in this study are much lower than those in the arid environments and comparable to those in the unsaturated zones. Leaching by snow meltwater may be the main sink for ClO4− in soil, and deeper depths for aqueous migration may contribute to the lower ClO4− concentrations in Antarctic surface soil compared to the values in the arid areas with low precipitation amount. Due to the biological origin of NO3−, no correlation between NO3− and ClO4− in soil is observed in this study, different from the observations in arid areas. In addition, no significant correlation is observed between organic matter contents and ClO4− concentrations in soil, suggesting that biological reduction is not an important sink for ClO4− in Antarctic soil.","","article","","207","","","Sources and sinks of perchlorate in soil in coastal ice-free areas of Antarctica","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816221005646","0341-8162","2021","105706","CATENA"

Long-term climate variability is expected to lead to increases in both the magnitude and distribution of disturbances. As a consequence it is important to develop monitoring systems to better understand these changes in the terrestrial biosphere as well to inform managers about disturbance agents more typically captured through specific monitoring programs (such as focused on insect, fire, or agricultural conditions). Changes in the condition, composition and distribution pattern of vegetation can lead to changes in the spectral and thermal signature of the land surface. Using a 6-year time series of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data we apply a previously proposed Disturbance Index (DI) which has been shown to be sensitive to both continuous and discontinuous change. Using Canada as an example area, we demonstrate the capacity of this Disturbance Index to monitor land dynamics over time. As expected, our results confirm a significant relationship between area flagged as disturbed by the index and area burnt as estimated from other satellite sources (R2=0.78, p<0.0001). The DI also demonstrates a sensitivity to capture and depict changes related to insect infestations. Further, on a regional basis the DI produces change information matching measured wide-area moisture conditions (i.e., drought) and corresponding agricultural outputs. These findings indicate that for monitoring a large area, such as Canada, the time series based DI is a useful tool to aid in change detection and national monitoring activities.","","article","","113","","","Large area monitoring with a MODIS-based Disturbance Index (DI) sensitive to annual and seasonal variations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000650","0034-4257","2009","1250-1261","Remote Sensing of Environment"

However, certain seafood, in particular shellfish, may become contaminated with naturally occurring toxins. The existence of shellfish toxins has been known for centuries and early attempts to deal with this threat led to the creation of folklore rituals and religious customs among tribal and ethnic groups. Eventually it was found that these toxins are produced by microbial organisms, usually phytoplankton, that occur naturally in the ocean. In Canada, as well as other countries with cold or temperate coastal waters, three groups of toxins are of particular importance and these are the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins, the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) toxin. Since it is virtually impossible to prevent the occurrence of these toxins, the approach in modern times has been to monitor seafood for the presence or absence of toxins using a standardized mouse bioassay. However, not all toxins can be detected effectively by this method and there is a trend in several countries to dispense with the mouse bioassay. Furthermore, there are differences between countries as to the preferred method of sampling and analysis and there is not agreement between all countries concerning tolerance levels of the various toxins in seafood. These difficulties, the occurrence of new toxins, and the rapid expansion of the shellfish aquaculture industry have put considerable pressure upon the scientific community to develop new methods of coping with these toxins, including more sensitive chemical or biochemical assays that are rapid and inexpensive. The possibilities and options for coping with these ubiquitous toxins are presented and discussed.","","article","","28","","","Dealing with seafood toxins: present approaches and future options","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0963996995000013","0963-9969","1995","347-358","Food Research International"

Ancient records, on the other hand, rely on the natural magnetization of archaeological artifacts and other materials, such as rocks and sediments, being therefore indirect, less accurate and sparser. The combination of such heterogeneous records into a single, self-consistent, global model of the geomagnetic field is very challenging: the highly uneven data coverage, both in space and time, requires a careful handling of data uncertainties and error correlations. Previous models dealt with this problem using separated treatments of instrumental data and indirect records, respectively, as well as a different handling of the dipole field component, with respect to non-dipole terms. Here we present a global geomagnetic field model based, for the first time, on the simultaneous inversion of historical, archaeomagnetic, and volcanic records, using a Bayesian approach with minimal-committing time regularization that minimizes the energy of secular variation. A detailed assessment of data uncertainty and error correlation is used to minimize artifacts generated by the appearance of an overwhelming number of incomplete, mostly declination-only records, associated with shipboard measurements in the early colonial period. Our model yields lower dipole energies, which better match modern values, as well as higher non-dipole energies and a stronger secular variation of the dipole moment. Some model artifacts associated with extremely heterogeneous distributions of records in time and space are not completely eliminable and might be caused by incorrect a-priori uncertainty assessments. Alternatively, they might represent an intrinsic limit that can be overcome only by adding new records at critical locations and times.","","article","","290","","","A Bayesian iterative geomagnetic model with universal data input: Self-consistent spherical harmonic evolution for the geomagnetic field over the last 4000 years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003192011830195X","0031-9201","2019","57-75","Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors"

We present the first analysis of long-term (2000–2018) hourly ozone (O3) and ozone precursor gas trends at three Nova Scotia provincial monitoring locations (‘urban’ Halifax, ‘suburban’ Halifax at Lake Major and ‘regional background’ at Aylesford Mountain), together with an examination of provincial ozone precursor emission trends. The precursors considered are nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Over the common data period for the three stations (2006–2017) the annual 99th percentile hourly ozone concentrations decreased significantly in Halifax (−0.77 ppb/year; p = 0.02) and at Aylesford (−0.65 ppb/year; p = 0.03), in agreement with regional trends. No statistically significant changes were found in high ozone at suburban Lake Major (−0.02 ppb/year; p = 0.94), but the annual 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile hourly ozone concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) only at this location (1.09 ppb/year, 1.23 ppb/year, 1.03 ppb/year, respectively). This is consistent with the strong NOx-O3 titration effect in downtown Halifax decreasing over time. After correcting for the titration effect over the full study period, the annual median Halifax total ozone is found to be decreasing (−0.45 ppb/year; p = 0.02). Over the full study period, ambient concentrations of precursors decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in Halifax by −2.34 ppb/year for NOx and −3.41 μg/m3/year for VOCs, as did the ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs (−9.66 μg/m3/year; p < 0.01). The underlying emissions of precursors also decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in and near Halifax (provincial NOx: 3982 ppb/year; provincial VOCs: 1680 tonnes/year), also in agreement with regional trends. However, a linear regression during 2012–2018 showed a decelerating reduction of provincial NOx emissions. Provincial total VOC emissions also decreased approximately ten times slower during 2012–2018, albeit this was not statistically significant. Finally, we present an algorithm to identify events of long-range transported pollution in Halifax, based on spatial correlations in ozone across surface monitoring stations in Nova Scotia. Between 2000 and 2018, transported upstream pollution was found to be connected to between 45% and 63% of 1444 days when surface ozone was elevated in Halifax. The frequency with which transported pollution events occur increased by 15% across this time period.","","article","","261","","","Surface ozone in the North American pollution outflow region of Nova Scotia: Long-term analysis of surface concentrations, precursor emissions and long-range transport influence","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231021003587","1352-2310","2021","118536","Atmospheric Environment"

To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photoacclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by integrating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant relationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO. The in situ Chl-a, aph(443), adg(443), Kd(490) and C¯ pd were used to validate the various empirical algorithms available as well as the satellite-retrieved data. The MODIS and VIIRS data correlated moderately.

The Au–Ag bearing quartz veins of the mine occur as narrow open-space fillings within Cretaceous silicic pyroclastics. The vein minerals consist mainly of quartz, sericite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena, with some electrum and argentite. The main objectives of this study were to study the geochemical characteristics of rocks, soils and plants in this area, to investigate the spatial relationship between Au and associated elements in rock–soil–plant system, and to evaluate the applicability of biogeochemical prospecting for Au vein occurrences in Korea. Samples of rocks and soils, and leaves of three plant species (Japanese red pine — P. densiflora, oriental white oak — Q. aliena, Japanese mallotus — M. japonicus) were collected from the target mineralized area and control barren locations, and analyzed for trace elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Sampling lines were composed of one slope line which is almost parallel to the mineralized quartz-veins, and four transect lines spaced 100m apart across the veins at 20m sampling intervals. From the multi-element data of rock samples (n=9), high values of Au (maximum 2030ppb) are spatially related to Au–quartz veins. Soil samples (n=61) collected from five sampling lines show higher values of Au (24–825ppb) whereas soil samples from the control locations have lower values of Au (below 25ppb). Many plant species collected from the vicinity of the veins have high Au contents compared with those at the control locations, but the ranges of Au values are variable among plant species. In a total of 128 samples of plant leaves, Q. aliena yielded Au values of 0.4 to 6.9ppb, and M. japonicus 0.9 to 4.1ppb. Gold contents in P. densiflora ranged from 0.1 to 5.6ppb. Plant leaves from control areas show less than 1.6ppb Au. The biological absorption coefficient (BAC) of Au in plants decreases in the order of Q. aliena>M. japonicus>P. densiflora.

Alterations in wave climate were little addressed in the four IPCC reports although variations in wave climate may cause extensive coastal impacts. Changes are also often related to climate pattern variability. This variability as well as long-term trends has been an issue of research in recent years. In the region of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) an understanding of wave climate and its variability is scant. In this paper we use an extensively calibrated and validated wave reanalysis to describe the wave climatology in the region at different time scales and for scalar and directional wave parameters. Long-term changes are identified in the wave heights and mean direction of the energy flux shows high spatial variability. Correlation patterns of the mean significant wave height and direction of mean energy flux lead to the detection of prominent modes of influence of several climate indices. A wave climate type approach is also used to identify wave variability along the region that allows an identification of different wave climate types in terms of wave parameters and occurrence frequency. In line with the results, the influence of El Niño events shows a higher frequency of occurrence of certain sea-states with respect to non ENSO years. We also explore how climate change affecting storm patterns may be translated into a modification of sea-state occurrence and therefore implying different consequences for coastal zones depending on local wave propagation.","","article","","100","","","Variability of multivariate wave climate in Latin America and the Caribbean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818112001828","0921-8181","2013","70-84","Global and Planetary Change"

However, most of the current studies mainly focus on modeling overall energy consumption without distinguishing its patterns of different temporal features. At the same time, advances in metering technologies and machine learning methods provide new opportunities for detailed predictions. In this paper, a day-ahead prediction model based on the improved recognized patterns via fuzzy C-means clustering and nonlinear regression is proposed and discussed. The proposed indirect pattern recognition is carried out by taking advantage of the connotative incidence relation between fluctuation features and influencing factors. Considering the different temporal characteristics of hourly SEEC, this proposed model is applied in an office building with the scope to manage the day-ahead prediction of hourly HVAC subentry and hourly socket subentry. These are taken as the typical non-stationary sequence and typical stationary sequence respectively. Results show that the proposed pattern recognition is applicable for the non-stationary HVAC subentry, and a stable energy pattern can contribute to accurate predictions. Furthermore, the introduction of additional hourly meteorological parameters improves the accuracy via rolling prediction instead. Finally, the modeling adaptability and applicable implications are summarized for references of optimal building energy operation.","","article","","211","","","Day-ahead prediction of hourly subentry energy consumption in the building sector using pattern recognition algorithms","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544220316388","0360-5442","2020","118530","Energy"

In this article, we present the argument that cyber warfare will threaten civilian peace and security long after a conflict has ended, and that existing peace operations will be required to evolve in order to address this threat. We explore how existing UN peacekeeping operations could be adapted, in ways that would be both feasible and valuable towards maintaining and restoring peace in a region.

Resulting from a generalized Boltzmann distribution, the expression of this energy of displacement is obtained by radial integration over the forces which are in balance with the pressure gradient force in the horizontal equation of motion. A scale analysis helps to find out which balance of forces prevail. According to the prevailing balances, the expression of the energy of displacement differs for various depressions. Investigating the system at the moment of maximum intensity, the energy of displacement can be interpreted as the work that has to be done to generate and finally eliminate the pressure anomaly, respectively. By choosing the appropriate balance of forces, number–intensity (energy of displacement) distributions show exponential behavior with the same decay rate β for tornadoes and cyclones, if tropical and extra-tropical cyclones are investigated together. The decay rate is related to a characteristic (universal) scale of the energy of displacement which has approximately the value Eu=β−1≈1000 m2s−2. In consequence, while the different balances of forces cause the scales of velocity, the energy of displacement scale seems to be universal for all low pressure systems. Additionally, if intensity is expressed as lifetime minimum pressure, the number–intensity (pressure) distributions should be power law distributed. Moreover, this work points out that the choice of the physical quantity which represents the intensity is important concerning the behavior of intensity distributions. Various expressions of the intensity like velocity, kinetic energy, energy of displacement and pressure are possible, but lead to different behavior of the distributions.","","article","","93","","","On the theory of intensity distributions of tornadoes and other low pressure systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809508002755","0169-8095","2009","11-20","Atmospheric Research"

Proxy data suggests the presence of Neoglacial advances but few moraines or glacial features from this time have been dated compared to glaciated landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere. Debate continues on whether parts of Antarctica experienced glacial advance at the same time as the “Little Ice Age” (LIA), which is well-documented in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide new evidence for late Holocene glacial fluctuations at three locations along the Antarctic Peninsula. A moraine or till sheet from a tidewater glacier cross cuts a series of dated raised beaches at Tay Head, Joinville Island along the northwestern Weddell Sea. At Spark Point, on Greenwich Island, a glacier has overrun Holocene raised beaches and a shell-bearing marine deposit is reworked into a glacial diamicton. A third site in Calmette Bay within the larger Marguerite Bay also contains a recent moraine that cuts across a series of dated raised beach ridges. The new ages constraining these glacial advances are in broad agreement with the handful of other existing ages on moraines and proxy records suggestive of cooler conditions within the Antarctic Peninsula. Combining available timing constraints into a Bayesian model yields an age of 400 to 90 cal BP (1550–1860 CE; 95%) for the LIA across the Antarctica Peninsula. Consideration of a two-phase glacial advance within our Bayesian framework does fit more of the data from across the Antarctic Peninsula and suggests advances from 575 to 330 cal BP (1375–1620 CE) and 400 to 50 cal BP (1550–1900 CE). However, more work is needed to determine if such a two-phase advance occurred. Regardless, its similar timing within the Antarctic Peninsula to that of the Northern Hemisphere supports recent assertions of a volcanic or solar forcing for the LIA. These recent readvances also provide a possible mechanism for changes in the rates of Holocene relative sea-level change recorded across the Antarctic Peninsula suggesting that the Antarctic ice sheets may have been more responsive to past climate changes than previously thought and glacial isostatic adjustment from the LIA and possibly other Holocene glacial oscillations is superimposed upon the longer relaxation from the Last Glacial Maximum.","","article","","271","","","Evidence for a “Little Ice Age” glacial advance within the Antarctic Peninsula – Examples from glacially-overrun raised beaches","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379121004029","0277-3791","2021","107195","Quaternary Science Reviews"

In this regard, here we present a completely new, 14C-dated and synchronised multi-proxy chronology from the Lake Anónima (Vega Island, north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula) that provides a unique insight into the Late Holocene environment. In particular, we aim to interpret the substantial environmental and climatic change between the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal and Neoglacial periods using various geochemical (total organic carbon, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy), petrophysical (magnetic susceptibility, laser granulometry) and biological (diatom biostratigraphy) proxies. The termination of the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal, characterised by overall warmer climate with favourable conditions for biogenic productivity, is followed by the regional-scale Neoglacial period, distinctive by the onset of climate deterioration, decreased siliciclastic input, suppressed biogenic (diatom) productivity and low organic content. Based on a principal component analysis, a multi-proxy record provides the precise timing of the Neoglacial onset in the Lake Anónima record at 2050 (2σ: 1990–2130) cal. yrs BP. Applying an adjacent and correlative ice-core (James Ross Island ice cap, r = 0.42), as well as a composite lake sediment (Beak Island, r = 0.49) chronologies, our research provides a refined timing of the Neoglacial onset for the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula, which is determined to be 2070 ± 50 yrs.

Here, we present the REE concentrations and 143Nd/144Nd (expressed in epsilon units, εNd) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios of detrital and authigenic (leached FeMn oxyhydroxides) fractions from sediment core-top samples and of estuarine water samples collected in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) and continental shelf off southeastern Canada. The REE distribution patterns, εNd values, and 87Sr/86Sr isotopic values from the detrital fraction allow for the discrimination of sediment from continental sources in the EGSL. Sediments in the Baie des Chaleurs and on the continental shelf, which have εNd values ranging from −14.3 to −16, 87Sr/86Sr values ranging from 0.72708 to 0.71475, and low La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios, are mainly supplied by the early Paleozoic Appalachian Mountains. In contrast, sediments in the Laurentian and Esquiman channels (εNd = −18.7 to −21.8, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.72068 to 0.72607, and high La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios) come from the Grenvillian metamorphic rocks in the Canadian Shield, and surface sediments on the southern Labrador Shelf (εNd = −28.7, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.73062, and high La/Yb and Gd/Yb ratios) mainly originate from the Hudson Strait and Baffin Bay.

Based on these results and the dissolved REE concentrations, we speculate that salt-induced coagulation of colloidal matter, dissolution of lithogenic sediments from the adjacent continents (notably from the erosion of the Grenville Province on the North Shore), bottom scavenging within the nepheloid layer, and brine rejection during sea ice formation significantly influence the distribution of REEs and the authigenic εNd signal throughout the water column in the EGSL. Overall, our results both underscore the fact that caution must be exercised when interpreting authigenic εNd records due to bottom water-mass mixing in estuarine and coastal marine environments and highlight the potential of REE and NdSr isotope compositions in investigating changes in sediment sources and transport pathways in the EGSL.","","article","","211","","","REE distribution and Nd isotope composition of estuarine waters and bulk sediment leachates tracing lithogenic inputs in eastern Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420318302421","0304-4203","2019","117-130","Marine Chemistry"

Aerosol emissions over Asia are also changing rapidly. However, the evolution of physical, optical and chemical columnar aerosol characteristics, and their radiative effects over time, and the resultant impacts of such evolving trends on climate and other associated risks are not yet properly quantified, and used in climate impact assessments. In order to do so, we closely examine, in addition to satellite observations, for the first time, high-quality, ca. two-decade long ground-based observations since 2001 of aerosols and their radiative effects from several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in South Asia and the North China Plain (NCP) in East Asia. A clear divergence in the trends in AODs is evident between the IGP and the NCP. The single scattering albedo (SSA) is increasing, and the absorption AOD due to carbonaceous aerosols (AAODCA) is decreasing over both regions, confirming that aerosols are becoming more scattering in nature. The trends in observed aerosol content (AOD) and composition (SSA) are statistically significant over Kanpur in the IGP and Beijing in the NCP, two locations with longest ground-based records. The aerosol radiative forcing of atmosphere (ARFATM) and resultant atmospheric heating rate (HR) are decreasing over both regions. However, current regionally coherent and high annual HR of 0.5–1.0 K day−1 has severe implications to climate, hydrological cycle, and cryosphere over Asia and beyond.

However, a ∼ 2-by-3-km buried rectangular feature was discovered opportunistically in the southeast of the Qatar Peninsula while performing radar subsurface mapping of structural conduits for groundwater characterization. The feature is characterized by its unique contrasting patterns of surface and subsurface roughness as well as its organic-rich mixture of soils, as assessed from high-resolution radar and multispectral observations, respectively, and validated with GPR and EM subsurface probing. The above characteristics could be the only remaining evidence for a large primitive settlement due to the harsh erosive setting. To explore the natural or anthropogenic origin of this anomalous feature, we compare its dimensions, structural setting, roughness, and composition to similar formations in the Qatar Peninsula and other arid karst environments. Findings suggest that the feature is texturally and compositionally unique within the Qatar Peninsula, and is not reproduced in other arid karst terrains nor reproduced by the fracture patterns associated with the Qatar-South Fars Arch. We hypothesize that the feature is a karst depression modified by semi-stationary primitive human settlements ∼ 3640 BP or earlier based on radiocarbon dating of in-situ charcoal samples. Moreover, the organic-rich mixture of soil and the occurrence of several symmetrical features observed inside the perimeter suggest that landscaping, farming and irrigation activities could have occurred within the site, further suggesting that long-lasting wet conditions—with sufficient fresh water resources or reliance on karst aquifers—were able to sustain a relatively large primitive settlement not previously witnessed in the region’s archaeological record. Future improvements in the resolution and coverage of orbital L-band radar observations, as used above, can provide new insights into understanding prehistoric human occupation under fluctuating climatic conditions and groundwater dynamics in these hyper-arid regions.","","article","","183","","","Exploring the nature of buried linear features in the Qatar peninsula: Archaeological and paleoclimatic implications","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271621002690","0924-2716","2022","210-227","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing"

Its role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis is of considerable interest. These nutraceuticals should be further explored in large-scale clinical trials in these areas.

Further analyses indicate TSP and precipitation extreme in CA have significant positive correlation with the increasing water vapor transport from the southern boundary. Meanwhile, increasing horizontal moisture advection and enhanced vertical moisture advection, contributes to increasing in TSP and precipitation extreme in NKZ and TSM. In addition, negative phase of East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR) may result in the cyclone anomalous and deepened trough over CA, which cooperates with enhanced vertical advection and abnormal south moisture, finally provides favorable conditions for precipitation and precipitation extreme.","","article","","8","","","Spatiotemporal variability of summer precipitation and precipitation extremes and associated large-scale mechanisms in Central Asia during 1979–2018","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589915520300122","2589-9155","2020","100061","Journal of Hydrology X"

Consistent and precise new measurements are needed to assess and predict these changes. New altimeter missions equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode provide more accurate sea level heights. In this work we analyse their impacts on the estimation of the coastal sea level variability in the last 10 km. First, by analysing various standard and improved SAR altimetric products it is found that SAR altimetry will reduce the minimum usable distance from five to three kilometres. The best performance is achieved with the SAR coastal retrackers SAMOSA+ and SAMOSA++. A comparable performance is obtained in low resolution Reduced SAR (RDSAR) mode with the Spatio-Temporal Altimeter sub-waveform Retracker (STAR). In both cases, sea level heights are recovered with 4 cm accuracy up to 3 km from the coast at the Helgoland station, and the accuracy does not decrease with the distance to coast. In estuaries and coastal zones with hight tidal regimes, the discrepancy between altimetry and in-situ observations remains large (40 cm standard deviation difference (stdd) with SAR-SAM+). CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A have similar accuracy, despite their different repeat cycle and sampling, which require a different post-processing. The monthly coastal variability from the SAR-SAM+ product agrees most favourably with the NEMO-WAM model, with stdd 3.9 and correlation 0.90 for Sentinel-3A. Instead, the maximum departure between altimeter data products is between SAR-SAM+ and RDSAR-TALES CryoSat-2 data (stdd 2.3 and correlation 0.96). An average trend of about 3 ± 1.3 mm/yr has been detected using low resolution altimetry at ninetheen in-situ stations along the German coast over time intervals longer than 15 years. The difference of the trends of altimetry and tide gauge co-located time-series (al-tg) agrees with the GNSS rates within 1.5 mm/yr at half of the co-located locations, with error of al-tg larger than the error of the GPS rate by a factor bigger than two. The larger departure between monthly tide gauge and LRM altimetric time-series as between tide gauge and SAR altimetric time-series confirms the higher accuracy of SAR data compared to LRM. Finally, the sea level trends of the merged LRM and SAR altimetry time-series are consistent with the LRM trends.","","article","","68","","","Advances in NE-Atlantic coastal sea level change monitoring by Delay Doppler altimetry","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117720307717","0273-1177","2021","571-592","Advances in Space Research"

We estimate the associated change in the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere and the surface. To that end, we perform new simulations with the CMIP6 global climate model EC-Earth3. The simulations use the here newly created data for the anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated effect on clouds from the simple plumes parameterization (MACv2-SP), based on revised SO2 and NH3 emission scenarios. Our results highlight the small impact of the pandemic on the global aerosol radiative forcing in 2020 compared to the CMIP6 scenario SSP2-4.5 of the order of +0.04Wm−2, which is small compared to the natural year-to-year variability in the radiation budget. Natural variability also limits the ability to detect a meaningful regional difference in the anthropogenic aerosol radiative effects. We identify the best chances to find a significant change in radiation at the surface during cloud-free conditions for regions that were strongly polluted in the past years. The post-pandemic recovery scenarios indicate a spread in the aerosol forcing of −0.68 to −0.38Wm−2 for 2050 relative to the pre-industrial, which translates to a difference of +0.05 to −0.25Wm−2 compared to the 2050 baseline from SSP2-4.5. This spread falls within the present-day uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing and the CMIP6 spread in aerosol forcing at the end of the 21st century. We release the new MACv2-SP data for studies on the climate response to the pandemic and the recovery scenarios. Our 2050 forcing estimates suggest that sustained aerosol emission reductions during the post-pandemic recovery cause a stronger climate response than in 2020, i.e., there is a delayed influence of the pandemic on climate.","","article","","264","","","Radiative effects of reduced aerosol emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the future recovery","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809521004221","0169-8095","2021","105866","Atmospheric Research"

One of the challenges of this technique is to differentiate pCO2 elevations caused by CO2 leakage from variations in the natural baseline (which varies due to seasonal and other factors). This paper compares a covariance threshold for anomalous pCO2 (a threshold based on pCO2 and dissolved oxygen), with annual and seasonal constant thresholds, using data observed in two hydrologically contrasting areas in Osaka Bay, Japan. In one of these locations the water column is typically stratified throughout the year, whereas at the other it is vertically mixed. The covariance threshold often but not consistently outperforms the constant thresholds, but is effective in all the cases analyzed in the present study. In any season in the mixed area, and in winter in the stratified area, the possibility of false-negatives in the seasonal threshold method is smaller than or comparable with that in the covariance threshold one. In areas with large natural pCO2 variations, such as during summer in the stratified area, the covariance threshold method is efficient in detecting CO2 leakage whereas the seasonal threshold method is of little use. With a good understanding of local conditions, monitoring pCO2 with the covariance threshold method is a potentially useful but not sufficient option for leakage detection in the marine environment.","","article","","72","","","Detecting CO2 leakage at offshore storage sites using the covariance between the partial pressure of CO2 and the saturation of dissolved oxygen in seawater","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583617302803","1750-5836","2018","130-137","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

Acquiring consistent and long time series data on the spatial extent of snow cover doubtlessly plays a key role in our understanding and modeling of the current and future environmental dynamics. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for continuous retrieval of snow cover information by utilizing snow's contrasting reflectance characteristics at optical wavelengths. The pre-operational H35 covers the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the successor of the operational Pan-European H12 daily fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) product at ~1 km. Both products are developed through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of EUMETSAT by exploiting AVHRR channels. This study is focused on developing an alternative fully data-driven H35 product with improved accuracy using a machine learning (ML)-based approach. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithm is trained by using AVHRR reflectance data as well as the well-known snow and vegetation indices (i.e., NDSI and NDVI) to generate the new version of H35 fSCA product. The reference fSCA maps required for the training of MARS models are obtained from the higher resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The MARS-based fSCA models are validated against an initial test dataset composed of 15 Sentinel 2 scenes over European Alps, Tatra Mountain Range, and Turkey. The final MARS-H35 product is then rigorously assessed over the whole Northern Hemisphere within a temporal domain spanning from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019. The quantitative testing process involves the use of reference data in both continuous and dichotomous scales: i) Sentinel 2 derived reference fSCA maps, ii) ERA5-Land snow depth data, iii) MODIS MOD10A1 NDSI snow cover data, and finally iv) in-situ snow depth data. Additionally, qualitative assessment is also performed by visually comparing MARS-H35/MODIS false-color and MARS-H35/Sentinel 2-derived reference fSCA image pairs over various geographic regions. The overall results indicate that: i) the proposed MARS-H35 fSCA product overperforms the original H35, and ii) it has higher capability in detecting the fine variations in the extent of snow cover, especially across the fringes of the slopes in complex mountainous terrains.","","article","","272","","","A machine learning-based accuracy enhancement on EUMETSAT H-SAF H35 effective snow-covered area product","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442572200061X","0034-4257","2022","112947","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Results show that the system is capable of detecting fish shapes in video recordings and from these shapes quantifying changes in swimming speed and direction continuously throughout the day. Also variations between days were detected and these may have been associated with the daily shift in the tidal cycle.

Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province’s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC’s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.","","article","","410","","","Novel climates: Trajectories of climate change beyond the boundaries of British Columbia’s forest management knowledge system","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112717319175","0378-1127","2018","35-47","Forest Ecology and Management"

It is found that the SSCS shelf circulation is indicated by the strong seasonal reversal western boundary current (WBC) and prominent cyclonic circulation (eddy). The southeastward WBC brings homogeneous salty, colder, and high primary production of nanophytoplankton (PPN) water during winter-time from the northern and the cyclonic eddy region into the southern SSCS. In contrast, less salty, warmer, and less PPN are advected northwestward from Karimata into the northern region. These factors significantly influence the distribution of VBD and in turn the production of captured small pelagic fishes (CPUE), revealing two maxima (peaks) of both VBD and CPUE during the monsoon breaks (MB) with a time-lag of 2–3 month from the monsoon peaks. Relationship between oceanographic parameters and CPUE is examined statistically revealing that ocean current and PPN are significantly affect the CPUE. A relatively high PPN and strong current during the peaks of monsoon are correlated with lower CPUE. In contrast, during the MBs period CPUE maxima are associated with a relatively weak ocean current and consumed PPN that favor the abundance of small pelagic fishes.","","article","","54","","","Seasonal oceanographic changes and their implications for the abundance of small pelagic fishes in the southern South China Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352485522001736","2352-4855","2022","102499","Regional Studies in Marine Science"

Spaceborne remote sensing is the adequate way to map and evaluate multitemporal changes on the Antarctic vegetation at large but its nature of occurrence, in relatively small and sparse patches, makes the identification very challenging. The inclusion of an intermediate scale of observation between ground and satellite scales, provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery, is of great help not only for their effective classification, but also for discriminating their main communities (lichens and mosses). Thus, this paper quantifies accurately recent changes of the vegetated areas in Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) through a novel methodology based on the integration of multiplatform data (satellite and UAV). It consists of multiscale imagery (spatial resolution of 2 m and 2 cm) from the same period to create a robust classifier that, after intensive calibration, is adequately used in other dates, where field reference data is scarce or not available at all. The methodology is developed and tested with UAV and satellite data from 2017 showing overall accuracies of 96% and kappa equal to 0.94 with a SVM classifier. These high performances allow the extrapolation to a pair of previous dates, 2006 and 2013, when atmospherically clear very high-resolution satellite imagery are available. The classification allows verifying a loss of the total area of vegetation of 4.5% during the 11-year time period under analysis, which corresponds to a 10.3% reduction for Usnea sp. and 9.8% for moss formations. Nevertheless, the breakdown analysis by time period shows a distinct behaviour for each vegetation type which are evaluated and discussed, namely for Usnea sp. whose decline is likely to be related to changing snow conditions.","","article","","704","","","Monitoring recent changes of vegetation in Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) through satellite imagery guided by UAV surveys","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719352878","0048-9697","2020","135295","Science of The Total Environment"

Here, a water storage deficit index (WSDI) and modified WSDI are utilized for analyzing a holistic representation of drought. The results show that the drought events in recent times are well-identified and estimated using this approach over five lake basins in EA from 2002 to 2021. Although, the basin scale drought events are evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) from 2002 to 2021. The results showed a significant correlation between WSDI, MWSDI, and the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in all lake basins except in the Tana basin.

Increased precipitation is predicted under current climate change projections, which will put further pressure on urban populations and infrastructure. Roof greening can be used within flood mitigation schemes to restore the urban hydrological balance of cities. Intensive green roofs, with their deeper substrates and higher plant biomass, are able to retain greater quantities of runoff, and there is a need for more studies on this less common type of green roof which also investigate the effect of factors such as age and vegetation composition. Runoff quantities from an aged intensive green roof in Manchester, UK, were analysed for 69 rainfall events, and compared to those on an adjacent paved roof. Average retention was 65.7% on the green roof and 33.6% on the bare roof. A comprehensive soil classification revealed the substrate, a mineral soil, to be in good general condition and also high in organic matter content which can increase the water holding capacity of soils. Large variation in the retention data made the use of predictive regression models unfeasible. This variation arose from complex interactions between Antecedant Dry Weather Period (ADWP), season, monthly weather trends, and rainfall duration, quantity and peak intensity. However, significantly lower retention was seen for high rainfall events, and in autumn, which had above average rainfall.

This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of financial hedging and operational risk management strategies of 31 world leading tramp shipping companies through a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model using various data sources. Operational risk management strategies are categorized into long-term (e.g., fleet diversity and fleet age) and short-to-medium-term (e.g., relative trip distance, fleet repositioning flexibility, and trading diversity) strategies. We innovatively quantify the short-to-medium-term operational risk management strategies using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The results show that financial hedging can effectively reduce bunker fuel price risk exposure but cannot reduce freight rate risk exposure. Meanwhile, companies can use operational risk management strategies to effectively reduce both risk exposures.

However, the response of small glaciers to climate change can be modulated by non-climatic factors such as topography and debris cover and there remain a number of regions where their recent change has evaded scrutiny. This paper presents results of the first multi-year remote sensing survey of glaciers in the Kodar Mountains, the only glaciers in SE Siberia, which we compare to previous glacier inventories from this continental setting that reported total glacier areas of 18.8km2 in ca. 1963 (12.6km2 of exposed ice) and 15.5km2 in 1974 (12km2 of exposed ice). Mapping their debris-covered termini is difficult but delineation of debris-free ice on Landsat imagery reveals 34 glaciers with a total area of 11.72±0.72km2 in 1995, followed by a reduction to 9.53±0.29km2 in 2001 and 7.01±0.23km2 in 2010. This represents a ~44% decrease in exposed glacier ice between ca. 1963 and 2010, but with 40% lost since 1995 and with individual glaciers losing as much as 93% of their exposed ice. Thus, although continental glaciers are generally thought to be less sensitive than their maritime counterparts, a recent acceleration in shrinkage of exposed ice has taken place and we note its coincidence with a strong summer warming trend in the region initiated at the start of the 1980s. Whilst smaller and shorter glaciers have, proportionally, tended to shrink more rapidly, we find no statistically significant relationship between shrinkage and elevation characteristics, aspect or solar radiation. This is probably due to the small sample size, limited elevation range, and topographic setting of the glaciers in deep valleys-heads. Furthermore, many of the glaciers possess debris-covered termini and it is likely that the ablation of buried ice is lagging the shrinkage of exposed ice, such that a growth in the proportion of debris cover is occurring, as observed elsewhere. If recent trends continue, we hypothesise that glaciers could evolve into a type of rock glacier within the next few decades, introducing additional complexity in their response and delaying their potential demise.","","article","","101","","","Accelerated loss of alpine glaciers in the Kodar Mountains, south-eastern Siberia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092181811200238X","0921-8181","2013","82-96","Global and Planetary Change"

With an annual mean flow of 26,500 m3/s, it receives 160 million tons/yr of suspended sediments. The high content of cohesive fine sediments in the estuary generates high turbidity levels in its inner and intermediate zones, which can be clearly seen in color satellite images. In this work, an image-based algorithm was successfully implemented to remotely detect the turbidity front of the Río de la Plata, based on the top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in the red band of MODIS-Aqua satellite. The algorithm finds the reflectance level that ‘best’ separates two water classes: turbid fluvial and clear ocean waters. The front dynamic was studied combining remotely sensed information and data of river discharge, winds, salinity and sea level time series, in the four-year period 2014–2017. River discharge was identified as the main external forcing, revealing a solid general pattern of behavior: when discharge was high (low) the front tended to be located in the outer (intermediate) zone of the estuary. Sea level seemed to be a secondary forcing, presenting higher correlations along the center of the estuary than near both coasts. Local winds needed to have a relatively persistent (2-day) component in a given direction to affect the location of the front. Additionally, results of an already implemented numerical model of the Río de la Plata were evaluated in terms of spatio-temporal performance, considering turbidity and salinity fronts locations. New strengths and limitations of the model were identified, and an improvement in the parameterization of sediments’ settling velocity was tested. Model results revealed the relative importance of bottom shear stress on the general location of the front, and of salinity on the flocculation process of cohesive sediments. This work provided new insights for the understanding of the Río de la Plata estuarine dynamics through the combination of three complementary tools – remote sensing, in situ data, and numerical modeling, – which may be extended to other systems around the world.","","article","","213","","","Spatio-temporal dynamics of the Río de la Plata turbidity front; combining remote sensing with in-situ measurements and numerical modeling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434320302545","0278-4343","2021","104301","Continental Shelf Research"

There has been a perceptible increase in the importance of power quality in recent years due to the introduction of new methods for electrical energy production and utilization in ship systems. As a result, new challenges for ship designers, crew members, and ship classification societies are looming. In this paper, these challenges are considered in the context of their legal meaning and good engineering practice. The paper presents the authors׳ stance in the ongoing discussion ensuing after the accident on board the Queen Mary 2. The authors briefly discuss the following questions: How is it possible to describe the power quality in ship systems and by what indexes? What limiting values are to be imposed? How, when and where should the power quality be measured? Finally, how can the rules and procedures of ship classification societies related to power quality be improved to avoid catastrophic consequences of worsening power quality?","","article","","107","","","Problems of power quality in the wake of ship technology development","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801815003492","0029-8018","2015","108-117","Ocean Engineering"

The patient’s life depends upon the accuracy of the treatment plan, which is left in the hands of the vendor-specific software automatically generating the plan after an initial patient consultation and planning with a medical professional. However, corrupted and erroneous treatment plan data have previously resulted in severe patient harm when errors go undetected and radiation proceeds. The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic error-checking system to prevent the accidental delivery of radiation treatment to an area of the human body (i.e., the treatment site) that differs from the plan’s documented intended site. To this end, we develop a method for structuring treatment plan data in order to feed machine-learning (ML) classifiers and predict a plan’s treatment site. In practice, a warning may be raised if the prediction disagrees with the documented intended site. The contribution of this paper is in the strategic structuring of the complex, intricate, and nonuniform data of modern treatment planning and from multiple vendors in order to easily train ML algorithms. A three-step process utilizing up- and down-sampling and dimension reduction, the method we develop in this paper reduces the thousands of parameters comprising a single treatment plan to a single two-dimensional heat map that is independent of the specific vendor or construction of the machine used for treatment. Our heat-map structure lends itself well to feed well-established ML algorithms, and we train–test random forest, softmax, k-nearest neighbors, shallow neural network, and support vector machine using real clinical treatment plans from several hospitals in the United States. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method characterizes treatment sites so well that ML classifiers may predict head-neck, breast, and prostate treatment sites with an accuracy of about 94%. The proposed method is the first step towards a thorough, fully automated error-checking system in radiation therapy.","","article","","10","","","An automated treatment plan alert system to safeguard cancer treatments in radiation therapy","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666827022001128","2666-8270","2022","100437","Machine Learning with Applications"

Here we present the first continuous Iberian stalagmite-based reconstruction of climate since the Bølling-Allerød interstadial, from a single stalagmite sample (GAR-01 from La Garma Cave, Cantabria). The ∼13.5 ka GAR-01 record provides the opportunity for replication, continuation, and aggregation of previously published records from northern Spain. The GAR-01 record reveals shifts in oxygen isotope ratios that are inexplicable by appealing to a single control (i.e., exclusively temperature, rainfall amount, etc.). Herein we explore the potential role of rainfall and temperature seasonality shifts on the new δ18O record using a simple Monte Carlo approach to estimate the seasonal distribution of rainfall and the annual temperature range at 100-year timeslices across the record. This model is corroborated by intervals of monthly-resolved laser ablation trace element data, providing glimpses into past Iberian seasonality shifts. The most salient features of the modelled results include extremely dry Younger Dryas winters (∼12.9–11.6 ka BP) and several intervals during the mid-Holocene with almost no summer rainfall (e.g., at 4.2 and 9.0 ka BP). By 1.6 ka BP, a near-modern rainfall seasonality was established. According to the modelling results, seasonal rainfall and temperature distribution variability can account for 95% of the record. The model presented here provides a new tool for extracting critical missing seasonality information from stalagmite δ18O records. Intervals where the model does not converge may represent transient climate anomalies with unusual origins that warrant further investigation.","","article","","226","","","North Iberian temperature and rainfall seasonality over the Younger Dryas and Holocene","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379119301921","0277-3791","2019","105998","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Laminae couplet thickness appears to be a function of changes in wind flow over the basin, with enhanced wind flow deepening the mixing zone and providing additional nutrients for laminae formation. Aeolian dust from Australia amplifies the wind signal. Spectral signals in the high power episodes are focused in <4 years and 6–8 years windows. These are consistent with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) periodicity. This climate system is known to play a major role in the modern Auckland climate whereby strongly negative (positive) ENSO are associated with enhanced (diminished) SW airflow over Auckland. ENSO events interact in the modern climate and the spectral results indicate that this is the case when spectral power is strong in the laminae.

New high-resolution (5 m) bathymetry revealed that Shirahama Bank has small volcanic edifices and depressions on its flat top with water depths of 60–150 m. The edifices have pointy summits with steep slopes greater than 30°. Within the depressions, a total of 59 acoustic bubble plumes were detected by shipboard multibeam sonar, suggesting that active volcanic degassing occurs in this region. The bank is dissected entirely by NW–SE to WNW–ESE trending lineaments while the volcanic edifices and depressions on the flat top are undissected. Shirahama Bank was formed by multiple-stages of volcanism. The youngest volcanic stage probably occurred after surface erosion by sea-level low-stand during the late Pleistocene and after tectonic deformation, providing a constraint on the timing of Quaternary volcanism in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Structural control of arc volcanism in the area is observed. The NW–SE to WNW–ESE lineaments identified on and around Shirahama Bank are interpreted as normal faults and form cross-arc graben structures. The young volcanic structures and active bubble plumes at Shirahama Bank and surrounding areas are concentrated within these cross-arc grabens, suggesting that the most recent volcanism is controlled by ~NE–SW extension (arc-parallel or along-arc extension) in the northern Ryukyu Arc. Our results, combined with previous studies, suggest that arc-parallel extension, which differs from the previously known back-arc extension in the Okinawa Trough, plays an important role in arc volcanism during its initial stages.","","article","","441","","","Volcanic and tectonic features of Shirahama Bank in the northern Ryukyu Arc: Implications for cross-arc volcanism controlled by arc-parallel extension","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002532272100205X","0025-3227","2021","106623","Marine Geology"

Spatial patterns of the change over the 20th century indicate many regions showing statistically significant warming, but not all. Changes in temperature are also assessed in greater detail: showing that the warming occurred more by reductions in cold extremes compared to increases in warm extremes and more at night than during the daytime. The 20th and early 21st century warming is finally placed in a longer context by considering millennial-length paleoclimatic information from many diverse proxies.

Despite the climatic and social relevancy of this type of episodes, there are some fundamental questions that would still be difficult to answer today, for example: where within the region are more cases recorded? or, which were the most potentially dangerous episodes? In this study, we identify, and then gather and unify information from, all the daily events occurred from 1980 to 2015. Using the MESCAN high-resolution gridded rainfall dataset, events are detected and for each case, the date and affected regions are recorded. Subsequently, events are ranked according to their magnitude and classified by weather type. In addition, flood data from the FLOODHYMEX and EM-DAT databases are used to check whether the precipitation episodes resulted in flooding. All this information is collected into a publicly available single database. Results show that the highest number of events per year is recorded in the Languedoc-Roussillon region (France) and in the Valencian Community (Spain). The cases of greatest magnitude, which are associated with a larger number of floods, present a very marked seasonality, with about 80% of them occurring in September, October and November. Finally, we show that only four weather types are present in most of the days with hazardous rainfall in the western Mediterranean. The most hazardous situation is characterized by a low-pressure area at all tropospheric levels in the eastern Atlantic, forming a block pattern with an anticyclonic ridge that tends to extend from the Central Mediterranean to Central Europe. About 40% of the most extraordinary cases are associated with this configuration. As an example, the infamous Piedmont (Italy) 1994 episode, in the top 10 of the ranking, was produced by an atmospheric pattern of this type.","","article","","255","","","Climatology and ranking of hazardous precipitation events in the western Mediterranean area","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809521000739","0169-8095","2021","105521","Atmospheric Research"

The observations carried out during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI) 2000 dry season field campaign often revealed the presence of an elevated biomass-burning aerosol layer above a semi-permanent stratiform cloud deck off the southern African coasts. MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products were used to investigate the existence of an aerosol indirect effect on convective clouds. Results are presented documenting cloud effective radius and cloud radiative forcing variations due to the presence of the aerosol during the development of convective clouds. Radiative transfer simulations in the visible (0.8μm, VIS) and near-infrared (1.6, 2.1 and 3.7μm, NIR) wavelengths were instrumental in establishing the extent of the influence of a biomass-burning aerosol layer overlying a water cloud sheet on the MODIS satellite retrieval of cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius and the optical thickness. The radiative transfer simulations suggest that the presence of the aerosol induces a significant underestimation of the cloud optical thickness, whereas an underestimation of the retrieved effective radius is more pronounced in the retrieval that makes use of the 1.6μm waveband than the 2.1 and 3.7μm wavebands. The MODIS cloud products of 3 days of the SAFARI 2000 campaign were analyzed to determine whether the aerosol induced biases evidenced by the simulations also affect the operational cloud property retrieval.

We argue that the time has come for micro and nano-satellites (with mass smaller than 100kg and 2–3 year development times) designed, built, tested and flown by academic departments, for coordinated observations with robotic assets in situ. We do so primarily by surveying SmallSat missions oriented towards ocean observations in the recent past, and in doing so, we update the current knowledge about what is feasible in the rapidly evolving field of platforms and sensors for this domain.

The best drought early warning systems utilize multiple sources of information in appropriate ways, taking advantage of each information source’s strengths. Predictive skill comes from slow changes in ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated climate, atmospheric weather patterns, and variations in land surface moisture and vegetation conditions. Slowly varying climate patterns, driven primarily by SSTs, can provide support for long-term forecasts. Then on 1- to 14-day timescales, predictions of weather systems can inform drought outlooks. Finally, weather observations, and the land surface response to these surface forcings provide lagged but reliable information on drought conditions and impacts. In general, as we transition from climate to weather to land information, we find increases in accuracy and spatial resolution but decreases in lead time. Before the season, statistical or dynamic climate forecasts can provide coarse projections of seasonal rainfall or reference evapotranspiration (RefET). As the season commences, observations or weather forecasts of these indicators provide rapidly available information; combining observations and weather forecasts can provide powerful mid-season indicators. Finally, late in the season, estimates of runoff, soil moisture, and vegetation can provide excellent sources of information that relate directly to hydrologic or agropastoral drought impacts and related food and livestock price variations. These land surface responses temporally lag rainfall but also provide high-quality information about impacts. Combining multiple sources of information in a defense-in-depth strategy provides multiple chances to detect droughts, greatly enhancing system performance, while also leveraging multiple sources of information. Here, we describe how such systems can be developed and provide examples for Somalia—one of the most drought prone and food insecure countries in the world.","","incollection","Elsevier","","Drought Early Warning and Forecasting","978-0-12-814011-6","Chapter 9 - Sources of drought early warning skill, staged prediction systems, and an example for Somalia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128140116000099","","2020","135-160",""

Here, we use lichens to monitor air quality and ecological integrity (EI) at Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site in Nova Scotia, Canada. We provide descriptions of two protocols and compare the results using data gathered in 2006, 2011, and 2016. To monitor air quality, we established 12 monitoring sites throughout the park and used a suite of lichens that are intolerant to air pollution to develop an index of air purity (IAP) that we compared every 5 years. Our protocol for monitoring EI of forest ecosystems was set up at these same 12 sites. We selected 50 regionally common field-identifiable lichen species and genera ranging in sensitivity from disturbance-tolerant to intolerant, and compare their presence in spatially constrained zones on a variety of tree species every 5 years. Our results suggest that air quality in Kejimkujik has increased slightly in the 10 years since monitoring was implemented, which is consistent with improvements in local air quality. Species richness also increased slightly, suggesting that EI has not declined. The maintenance of EI, through protection and restoration of natural resources, is a key priority in the management of national parks in Canada. Our protocols will provide early detection of changes to EI, enabling park managers to take responsive action. We are confident that our protocols can be replicated in other parts of the world with different suites of regionally common lichens.","","article","","81","","","Ten years of monitoring air quality and ecological integrity using field-identifiable lichens at Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site in Nova Scotia, Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X17303382","1470-160X","2017","214-221","Ecological Indicators"

In this work the scaling behavior of sea level is analyzed from time series of sea level observations. The wavelet domain is particularly attractive for the identification of scaling behavior in an observed time series. The wavelet spectrum from a scale-by-scale wavelet analysis of variance reproduces in the wavelet domain the power laws underlying a scaling process, allowing the estimation of the scaling exponent from the slope of the wavelet spectrum. Here the scaling exponent is estimated in the wavelet domain for time series of sea level observations in the North Atlantic: at coastal sites from tide gauges, covering 50 years of monthly measurements, and in the open ocean from satellite altimetry, covering 12 years of satellite measurements at 10 days intervals. Both tide gauge and altimetry time series exhibit scaling behavior. Furthermore, the degree of stochastic persistence is spatially coherent and distinct at the coast and in the open ocean. Near the coast, the stochastic structure of the sea level observations is characterized by long-range dependence with a moderate degree of persistence. Larger values of the scaling exponent, consistent with weaker persistence, are concentrated in the northern Atlantic. At mid-latitudes the stochastic dependence of sea level observations is characterized by strong persistence in the form of strong long-range and 1/f dependence.","","article","","371","","","Long-range dependence in North Atlantic sea level","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437106003888","0378-4371","2006","725-731","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications"

In this study, an image-based deep neural network (DNN) model for cloud identification and simultaneous retrieval of CTH and ice-COT is developed for Himawari-8 satellite infrared measurements. The DNN model is trained with brightness temperature data from four months in 2016 as the input, and cloud properties of an active remote sensing product from CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) as the target truth. Supplementary variables, including the vertical temperature profile, the surface elevation, and the geometrical parameters, are added as the input data. DNN model performance is first tested with an independent dataset, and then cases over a CloudSat track and a Himawari-8 granule (85°E–205°E, 60°S–60°N) are selected for further validation of the model by comparing its results with those from two physics-based models. For both the water- and ice-CTH estimates, the DNN model shows high consistency with the target values, with an overall CTH correlation coefficient of 0.90 for high ice clouds with COT ≥0.3. Notably, as an infrared method in nature, the DNN extends the predictable ice-COT to ~200, with relative biases of ~20% for high ice clouds with COT >1. The strong accuracy of the DNN model is primarily derived from its ability to learn from the spatial features imprinted on the input brightness temperature image, and its integration of information from neighboring pixels in a three-dimensional space. A single full disk estimation with the DNN model takes about 20 min using one processor; therefore, near-real-time cloud property retrieval that is uniformly available over 24 h can be obtained for severe weather monitoring and mesoscale cloud-system studies.","","article","","275","","","Cloud identification and property retrieval from Himawari-8 infrared measurements via a deep neural network","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722001407","0034-4257","2022","113026","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Additionally, man-made (anthropogenic) structures like navigation channels, excavation debrises and ships wrecks are also observed.

Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist. In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000). Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic. A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites. The results of the chemical analyses support the results obtained from geo-statistical modeling. It reveals high concentrations of health relevant airborne species like metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the zone of enhanced risk for the coincidence of temperature stress and PM pollution.","","article","","33","","","GIS-based identification of spatial variables enhancing heat and poor air quality in urban areas","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014362281100124X","0143-6228","2012","94-106","Applied Geography"

El Niño events result in negative moisture anomalies in the southwest Pacific and are implicated in droughts and catastrophic wildfires across eastern Australia. An amplification of tropical El Niño activity is reported in the east Pacific after ca. 6.7 ka; however, proxy data for ENSO-driven environmental change in Australia suggest an initial influence only after ca. 5 ka. Here, we reconstruct changes in vegetation, fire activity and catchment dynamics (e.g. erosion) over the last 14.6 ka from part of the southwest Pacific in which ENSO is the main control of interannual hydroclimatic variability: Paddy's Lake, in northwest Tasmania (1065 masl), Australia. Our multi-proxy approach includes analyses of charcoal, pollen, geochemistry and radioactive isotopes. Our results reveal a high sensitivity of the local and regional vegetation to climatic change, with an increase of non-arboreal pollen between ca. 14.6–13.3 ka synchronous with the Antarctic Cold Reversal, and a sensitivity of the local vegetation and fire activity to ENSO variability recorded in the tropical east Pacific through the Holocene. We detect local-scale shifts in vegetation, fire and sediment geochemistry at ca. 6.3, 4.8 and 3.4 ka, simultaneous with increases in El Niño activity in the tropical Pacific. Finally, we observe a fire-driven shift in vegetation from a pyrophobic association dominated by rainforest elements to a pyrogenic association dominated by sclerophyllous taxa following a prolonged (>1 ka) phase of tropical ENSO-amplification and a major local fire event at ca. 3.4 ka. Our results reveal the following key insights: (1) that ENSO has been a persistent modulator of southwest Pacific climate and fire activity through the Holocene; (2) that the climate of northwest Tasmania is sensitive to long-term shifts in tropical ENSO variability; and (3) that there has been possible stationarity in the spatial influence of ENSO over this region through the Holocene.","","article","","157","","","An early onset of ENSO influence in the extra-tropics of the southwest Pacific inferred from a 14, 600 year high resolution multi-proxy record from Paddy's Lake, northwest Tasmania","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379116306473","0277-3791","2017","164-175","Quaternary Science Reviews"

The interaction of contrasting air masses over the northern Arabian Sea often produces a two layer structure in the lower 5000 m close to the coastal station with warm and dusty air (Summer Shamal) occupying the space above the cool and moist Low Level Jet (LLJ) by virtue of their density differences. The warm air intrusion creates low lapse rate pockets above LLJ and modifies the gravitational stability strong enough to inhibit convection. It is observed that the inversion occurring in the lower 3000 m layer with an optimum layer thickness of 100–200 m has profound influence on the weather beneath it.

Total rainfall for the 12-month study period (2401mm) was close to the long-term mean (2500mmyear−1), but was highly variable from month to month with distinct dry periods in February, May, and December 2005. Measured annual ET of 996mmyear−1 was slightly higher than previous estimates for similar locations in Hawai‘i. However, the energy closure ratio was 0.784, leading us to adjust turbulent energy fluxes upward by 27.6%. The resulting adjusted annual ET of 1232mm is significantly higher than previous forest ET estimates for Hawai‘i. Variations in canopy conductivity suggest that midday stomatal closure is occurring and/or that evaporation is high in the morning because of frequent wet canopy conditions early in the day. The daily fraction of turbulent energy flux used for ET was observed to be lower for days with high net radiation, indicating that transpiration is being limited under conditions of high evaporative demand. ET was generally higher during rainy periods than dry periods. After controlling for differences in available energy, ET is, on average, 29% higher on days with rain than days without rain. The fraction of energy used for ET follows a distinct annual pattern, roughly corresponding to the observed cycle in leaf area at the site, with a minimum in mid-April and a maximum in mid-October. Variations in rainfall appear to be the cause of deviations from the annual cycle of the fraction of energy used for ET. This suggests that ET is strongly controlled by variations in canopy wetness at this wet forest site.","","article","","149","","","Evapotranspiration and energy balance of native wet montane cloud forest in Hawai‘i","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192308002323","0168-1923","2009","230-243","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

The question investigated here is whether Roman gold coins were also surfaced enriched. Two non-destructive techniques were employed to do this: X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and a ‘newer’ technique, muonic X-ray emission spectroscopy (μXES). For the latter, the momentum of the muons is controlled, allowing for the composition of the coin to be determined at various depths. Here we show that there is no surface enrichment of the Roman gold coins analysed. Furthermore, we show that XRF and μXES return congruent results at the near surface. This all supports the integrity of surface level analyses of Roman gold coins. We then discuss the broader applicability of our muon technique to the further study of Roman gold coinage, to the cultural heritage sector and to archaeological scientists more generally.","","article","","134","","","Understanding Roman Gold Coinage Inside Out","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440321001400","0305-4403","2021","105470","Journal of Archaeological Science"

SafeCOP will provide an approach to the safety assurance of CO-CPS, enabling thus their certification and development. The project will define a runtime manager architecture for runtime detection of abnormal behaviour, triggering if needed a safe degraded mode. SafeCOP will also develop methods and tools, which will be used to produce safety assurance evidence needed to certify cooperative functions. SafeCOP will extend current wireless technologies to ensure safe and secure cooperation, and also contribute to new standards and regulations, by providing certification authorities and standardization committees with the scientifically validated solutions needed to craft effective standards extended to also address cooperation and system-of-systems issues.

The 700-yr varve record is divided into two subannual series (early and late) based on sedimentological criteria and sedimentary structures within each varve. A comparison of recent subannual laminae with nearby meteorological records supports the interpretation they are formed by river discharge events generated by major snow and glacier melt events and large late-summer rainfall events. A significant correlation exists between the late subannual thickness series and the size of the largest rainfall events in late summer. The long record indicates there was an abrupt increase in the thickness and frequency of major rainfall-induced sedimentary events at the end of the seventeenth century. In addition, the frequency of laminae generated by early runoff events also increased. However, early subannual varve thickness component remains statistically the same as the thickness prior to the end of the seventeenth century. This suggests the change in varve thickness at this time is due to increases in major late-summer rainfall frequency rather than increased sediment availability caused by regional Little Ice Age glacier advances.","","article","","67","","","Century-scale variability in late-summer rainfall events recorded over seven centuries in subannually laminated lacustrine sediments, White Pass, British Columbia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033589406001463","0033-5894","2007","193-203","Quaternary Research"

This region contains many locations that are vulnerable to extreme sea levels in the current climate, and projections indicate that this vulnerability will increase in the future. The recent publication of authoritative statements on the relationship between global warming and global sea level rise, tropical cyclones and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon has motivated this review. Confident predictions of global mean sea level rise are modified by regional differences in the steric (density-related) component of sea level rise and changing gravitational interactions between the ocean and the ice sheets which affect the regional distribution of the eustatic (mass-related) contribution to sea level rise. The most extreme sea levels in this region are generated by tropical cyclones. The intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones is likely to increase, but many climate models project a substantial decrease in tropical cyclone numbers in this region, which may lead to an overall decrease in the total number of intense tropical cyclones. This projection, however, needs to be better quantified using improved high-resolution climate model simulations of tropical cyclones. Future changes in ENSO may lead to large regional variations in tropical cyclone incidence and sea level rise, but these impacts are also not well constrained. While storm surges from tropical cyclones give the largest sea level extremes in the parts of this region where they occur, other more frequent high sea level events can arise from swell generated by distant storms. Changes in wave climate are projected for the tropical Pacific due to anthropogenically-forced changes in atmospheric circulation. Future changes in sea level extremes will be caused by a combination of changes in mean sea level, regional sea level trends, tropical cyclone incidence and wave climate. Recommendations are given for research to increase understanding of the response of these factors to climate change. Implications of the results for adaptation research are also discussed.","","article","","80-81","","","Climate change impacts on tropical cyclones and extreme sea levels in the South Pacific — A regional assessment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818111001585","0921-8181","2012","149-164","Global and Planetary Change"

Long-term (>100years) daily precipitation and temperature records from three meteorological stations (Sodankylä in northern, Kajaani in central and Kaisaniemi in southern Finland) were used in an empirical snowmelt temperature-index model to simulate different SHPs. The Mann–Kendall non-parametric test was used to detect statistically significant (p<0.05) trends, the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts (STARS) to determine cold–mild and wet–dry climate modes, Pearson's coefficient (r) to measure temperature-precipitation and SWE correlations, and Spearman's rank correlation (rho) to identify linkages of these variables to well-known atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs) over the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. the Arctic Oscillation). Observed mean annual temperature significantly warmed, by a rate of 0.01°Cyear−1, at both Kaisaniemi during 1845–2011 and Sodankylä during 1908–2011, which was also associated with a shift from cold to mild climate in 1930 at Kaisaniemi and in 1988 at Sodankylä. However, mean annual temperature showed no clear trend at Kajaani, which was confirmed by the existence of periodicities in cold–mild climatic modes. Conversely, observed total annual precipitation decreased by 0.8mmyear−1 (p<0.05) only at Kajaani during 1903–2008, which was in accordance with the climate shift from wet to dry mode in 1939. The simulated peak annual SWE significantly decreased in the range 0.57–1.47mmyear−1 at all three stations studied during the 20th century, with the highest rate at Sodankylä. Comparisons of simulated 1-day to 10-day peak outflow indicated that snowmelt flux influenced simulated peak snowpack outflow much more than rainfall. Hence, the magnitude of simulated annual 1- and 10-day peak outflows decreased by 0.055±0.01 and 0.45±0.25mmyear−1 (p<0.05), respectively, in Finland during the last century. Moreover, simulated annual 1-day peak outflow timing significantly shifted to 12–28days earlier, while simulated annual 10-day peak outflow timing shifted to 8–40 days earlier (p<0.05). These results indicate that the snow resource in Finland has significantly declined during the past 100years under climate variability and change, partly controlled by the Arctic Oscillation, East Atlantic/West Russia, and East Atlantic patterns across the country.","","article","","118","","","Effects of climate variability and change on snowpack hydrological processes in Finland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165232X15001251","0165-232X","2015","14-29","Cold Regions Science and Technology"

To compare the studied sites and identify the possible occurrence of anomalous concentrations, trace elements were normalized by Al and linear regressions were also performed. For all trace elements (except Cu), regressions showed a significant correlation (p<0.05) and few outliers (<3% of cases), showing that the concentrations found represent natural values for this bay. In the case of Cu, the highest concentrations were found near small municipalities, which may be associated with domestic sewage. About 60% of the organic compounds occurred at levels below the limit of quantification (<0.26ngg−1). The sum of PAHs was low for all stations, ranging from 1.17 to 313ngg−1.

An attempt has been made to establish the origin of Cannabis pollen in this region to determine whether it is transported locally or from long distances based on air mass origins. Cannabis is an herbaceous, normally dioecious and anemophilous plant, which produces large quantities of pollen grains. It has been widely used for fibre (hemp), bird food (hempseed), essential oils and narcotics. The origin of Cannabis pollen grains has been established by calculating back trajectories at the altitudes of: 750, 1500 and 2500 m above mean sea level (m amsl); 350, 500 and 650 m amsl; and 10, 100 and 250 m amsl, using the HYSPLIT model. Considering this data, 29 days of Cannabis pollen potentially originating in Africa were identified in Cartagena, 19 days in Murcia and 15 days in Lorca. Of the remaining days, the air mass back trajectories showed local or regional pollen origins. These were 83 days in Cartagena, 61 days in Murcia and 57 days in Lorca. The presence of Cannabis in the bioaerosol of the Region of Murcia is irregular, and it is considered a minority pollen type. However, from 2017 to 2020, concentrations increased, with a positive and significant trend of 90% in the Annual Pollen Integral. The pollen season can be defined between June and August.

A simple analytical expression is then derived that relates a characteristic time furnished by the decomposition to the flaw depth, providing a basis for flaw depth estimation. This framework is shown to provide flaw-depth estimates with good levels of precision and robustness. Finally, application to experimental data is considered.

An upwelling event was predicted by the model prior to the appearance and population increase of potentially toxic diatoms, Pseudo-nitzschia, and associated domoic acid in shellfish. A downwelling episode was provided as a forecast in the model prior to the arrival of a Dinophysis bloom and detection of its associated biotoxins in Bay shellfish. The modelled forecast products developed included expected surface, mid-depth and bottom current pathways at the mouth of the Bay and on the adjacent shelf. The rate and direction of water volume flow at the mouth and mid-bay sections were produced by the model to examine predicted upwelling and downwelling pulses.

Station series (29) of maximum and minimum temperature are considered, starting from 1905 until 2006. The CTs (9 for spring and 8 for summer) are derived by a cluster method applied to daily mean SLP grids covering the period 1850–2003. Changes in the seasonal frequency of extreme temperatures and of CTs are analysed. Subsequently, the CTs are examined for their effectiveness in leading to moderately extreme temperatures (at each location) using an index that measures the contribution to extreme days with respect to the contribution to non-extreme days. Correlation between regional extreme series and CTs frequency is also tested. In spring, the decrease in cold nights, which is notable in the 1970s onwards, can be partially attributable to a downtrend in the frequency of Northerly flow. High frequency of Anticyclone in North Iberia in the 1980s and 1990s has contributed to an increase in warm days in West and North stations. To the SE quadrant of the IP, a great part of warm days is related to south-westerly flow, (both) presenting a higher frequency in the 1950s and the 1960s. In summer warm nights increased remarkably to the SE and SW, and may be in part related to uptrends in Iberian thermal low pattern (1950–2003) and North Atlantic Anticyclone (1850–2003) respectively. Warm days have increased remarkably to the NE especially in the 1990s and 2000s, but this is not found to be related to changes in CTs' frequency. Furthermore, the existence of within type changes (variations in Tmax, Tmin and extreme indices within the CTs) points to the identification of other physical factors operating on inter-annual to multidecadal time scales. Thus, the consideration of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the East Atlantic Ocean and Iberian soil moisture conditions (by means of a drought index) helps to explain the evolution of extreme temperatures.","","article","","127","","","Spring and summer extreme temperatures in Iberia during last century in relation to circulation types","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809512002396","0169-8095","2013","154-177","Atmospheric Research"

The method named dislocation superimposed method (DSM) is based on the improved random decrement technique (IRDT), differential function (DF) and correlation analysis (CA). The aim of DSM is to linearly superpose multiple segments of abnormal acoustic signals because of the waveform similarity of faulty components. The method uses sample points at the beginning of time when abnormal sound appears as the starting position for each segment. In this study, the abnormal sound belonged to shocking faulty type; thus, the starting position searching method based on gradient variance was adopted. The coefficient of similar degree between two same sized signals is presented. By comparing with a similar degree, the extracted fault component could be judged automatically. The results show that this method is capable of accurately extracting the fault component from abnormal acoustic signals induced by faulty shocking type and the extracted component can be used to identify the fault type.","","article","","75","","","Extraction of fault component from abnormal sound in diesel engines using acoustic signals","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327015005506","0888-3270","2016","544-555","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing"

The Safety Framework reflects an international consensus on best practices to achieve safety. Following the 1992 UN Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space, it is the second attempt by the international community to draft guidance promoting the safety of applications of nuclear power sources in space missions. NPS applications in space have unique safety considerations compared with terrestrial applications. Mission launch and outer space operational requirements impose size, mass and other space environment limitations not present for many terrestrial nuclear facilities. Potential accident conditions could expose nuclear power sources to extreme physical conditions. The Safety Framework is structured to provide guidance for both the programmatic and technical aspects of safety. In addition to sections containing specific guidance for governments and for management, it contains technical guidance pertinent to the design, development and all mission phases of space NPS applications. All sections of the Safety Framework contain elements directly relevant to engineers and space mission designers for missions involving space nuclear power sources. The challenge for organisations and engineers involved in the design and development processes of space nuclear power sources and applications is to implement the guidance provided in the Safety Framework by integrating it into the existing standard space mission infrastructure of design, development and operational requirements, practices and processes. This adds complexity to the standard space mission and launch approval processes. The Safety Framework is deliberately generic to remain relevantly independent of technological progress, of national organisational setups and of space mission types. Implementing its guidance therefore leaves room for interpretation and adaptation. Relying on reported practices, we analyse the guidance particularly relevant to engineers and space mission designers.","","article","","111","","","The International Safety Framework for nuclear power source applications in outer space—Useful and substantial guidance","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576515000582","0094-5765","2015","89-101","Acta Astronautica"

Isotopic variables, which are more commonly incorporated in research-based programs, can provide an indication of water sources and the transit time of water in a catchment. These variables may be a valuable complement to traditional water quality monitoring variables and have the potential to support improved hydrologic process-related insights from long term monitoring programs that typically have low resolution sampling. The purpose of this investigation is to explore the utility of incorporating isotopic variables (specifically δ18O, δ2H, and 222Rn) into routine monthly sampling regimes by comparing insights gained from these variables to monitoring only specific conductivity and chloride. A complete annual cycle of monthly groundwater and surface water monitoring data collected from the Upper Parkhill watershed in southwestern Ontario, Canada was used to characterize baseline watershed conditions, evaluate watershed resilience to climate change, and examine contamination vulnerability. Study results provide an improved understanding of appropriate tracer use in agricultural regions with isotopic variables able to provide important insights into the seasonality of hydrologic phenomena, such as the timing of groundwater recharge. A comparison of monitoring variables to present-day hydro-meteorological conditions suggests the importance of a winter dominated hydrologic regime and the potential influence of changes in precipitation on groundwater-surface water interactions. Estimated transit time dynamics indicate the likelihood for rapid contaminant transport through surface and shallow subsurface flow and highlight the possible effects of agricultural tile drainage. The sampling approach and data analysis methods adopted in this study provide the basis for improving routine watershed monitoring programs in agricultural regions.","","article","","344","","","Using isotopic tracers to enhance routine watershed monitoring – Insights from an intensively managed agricultural catchment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723011520","0301-4797","2023","118364","Journal of Environmental Management"

However, a Reaction Wheel problem forced relaxation of the repeatability constraint on the satellite’s orbit, which has been drifting slowly since July 2016. Beyond the expected contributions of this mission and its very good integration into the objectives of the constellation of altimetric satellites, it has become more and more apparent that specific contributions and innovations related to the main specification of SARAL/AltiKa, that is to say the use of the Ka-band, have clearly emerged. The advantages of the Ka-band are in short the reduction of ionosphere effects, the smaller footprint, the better horizontal resolution and the higher vertical resolution. A drawback of the Ka-band is the attenuation due to water/water vapor in case of rain and the resulting loss of data. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the specific advances of the Ka-band in different scientific and technical fields and to show why they are promising for the future and open the way to several missions or mission projects.

For full realisation of this potential in a tailored design process with realistic constraints, accurate information on the hydrodynamic loads acting on composite marine propellers and the structural integrity is of key importance. It is conceptualised that this information can be acquired without disturbing propeller hydrodynamics using a network of piezoelectric sensors embedded inside the blade. In this paper, feasibility of this concept has been investigated numerically and experimentally. Hydrodynamic loads on a composite propeller obtained from numerical simulations were used to assess the sensitivity of piezoelectric sensors in measuring the dynamic strain field due to the blade deformation. Subsequently, 25 small-scale carbon-epoxy composite samples were manufactured with embedded piezoelectric wafer sensors of different sizes, and subjected to non-destructive and destructive loading scenarios. Feasibility of measuring strains at different frequency ranges and damage-induced acoustic emissions was quantitatively assessed from these experiments. Furthermore, the influence of the embedded sensors on the ultimate strength and toughness of the specimens was investigated. It was found that at least 92% of the studied propeller blade would have dynamic strains measurable up to the first four harmonics by the considered piezoelectric sensors. In a four-point bending setup, it was additionally demonstrated that the embedded piezoelectric sensor captured damage-induced acoustic emissions up to specimen failure with an average signal to noise ratio of 17 dB. The results indicate that embedded piezoelectric sensor networks can have the capability to measure both low-frequency dynamic strains in composite marine propeller blades and damage-related acoustic emissions.","","article","","84","","","Feasibility evaluation for development of composite propellers with embedded piezoelectric sensors","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951833922000703","0951-8339","2022","103231","Marine Structures"

They include the updating of existing geologic maps, the location of anomalies related to hydrocarbon seepage, and the integration of the digital imagery into geologic databases to assess hydrocarbon potential on a given scale. Although most of these techniques are useful potentially in the Canadian environment, there seems to be some reticence in this country towards the use of remotely sensed data. Based on discussions with a number of industry and research personnel, an analysis is made of the reasons why Canadian geoscientists have not yet taken advantage of this readily available tool. Some explanations include: (1) the poor resolution of sensors such as the LANDSAT MSS, (2) the till and vegetation overlying parts of the country, and (3) the fact that some areas of the country are so well mapped that it is felt that a system such as LANDSAT could add no relevant information. Conversely, several considerations would seem to favor widespread usage of remotely sensed data in Canada now that the spectral and spatial resolutions of operational sensors are constantly improving. It is possible to map geologic features such as faults from remotely sensed imagery even if they are buried beneath deep till. The vegetation which covers so much of the land surface can provide both structural and geochemical information. There remain large expanses of the country that are relatively unexplored. Finally, considerable expertise exists in Canada in geoscience data integration and image processing, much of it related to mineral-resource work; this expertise may be directed towards petroleum-resource evaluation. Some procedures are recommended for Canadian petroleum geologists in order that they may derive maximum benefits from remotely sensed data.","","article","","12","","","The application of remote sensing to canadian petroleum exploration: promising and yet unexploited","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0098300486900701","0098-3004","1986","597-609","Computers & Geosciences"

A month-long intensive measurement campaign was conducted during spring 2016 at Mission Beach, a remote coastal site west of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) on the north-east coast of Australia. One aerosol pollution episode was investigated in early October. This event was governed by meteorological conditions and characterized by the increase in black carbon (BC) mass concentration (averaged value of 0.35 ± 0.20 μg m−3). Under the influence of the continental transportation, a new layer of nucleation-mode aerosols with an initial size diameter of 20 nm was observed and aerosol number concentrations reached the peak of 6733 cm−3 at a diameter of 29 nm. The averaged aerosol extinction coefficient at the height of 2 km was 150 Mm−1, with a small depolarized ratio (3.5–5%). Simultaneously, the boundary layer height presented a fall–rise trend in the presence of these enhanced aerosol concentrations and became stable in a later stage of the episode. We did not observe clear boundary layer height diurnal variations from the LiDAR observations or from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model outputs, except in an earlier stage of the aerosol episode for the former. Although the sea breeze may have been responsible for these particles, on the balance of available data, we suggest that the aerosol properties at the GBR surface during this period are more likely influenced by regional transportation of continental sources, including biomass-burning aerosols.","","article","","690","","","Characterization of aerosols over the Great Barrier Reef: The influence of transported continental sources","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719331201","0048-9697","2019","426-437","Science of The Total Environment"

This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.","","article","","70","","","Noise Reduction and Atmospheric Correction for Coastal Applications of Landsat Thematic Mapper Imagery","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425799000310","0034-4257","1999","167-180","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Pumped hydro storage is widely regarded as the most cost-effective option for this. However, its application is traditionally limited to certain topographic features. Expanding its operating range to low-head scenarios could unlock the potential of widespread deployment in regions where so far it has not yet been feasible. This review aims at giving a multi-disciplinary insight on technologies that are applicable for low-head (2-30 m) pumped hydro storage, in terms of design, grid integration, control, and modelling. A general overview and the historical development of pumped hydro storage are presented and trends for further innovation and a shift towards application in low-head scenarios are identified. Key drivers for future deployment and the technological and economic challenges to do so are discussed. Based on these challenges, technologies in the field of pumped hydro storage are reviewed and specifically analysed regarding their fitness for low-head application. This is done for pump and turbine design and configuration, electric machines and control, as well as modelling. Further aspects regarding grid integration are discussed. Among conventional machines, it is found that, for high-flow low-head application, axial flow pump-turbines with variable speed drives are the most suitable. Machines such as Archimedes screws, counter-rotating and rotary positive displacement reversible pump-turbines have potential to emerge as innovative solutions. Coupled axial flux permanent magnet synchronous motor-generators are the most promising electric machines. To ensure grid stability, grid-forming control alongside bulk energy storage with capabilities of providing synthetic inertia next to other ancillary services are required.","","article","","158","","","Low-head pumped hydro storage: A review of applicable technologies for design, grid integration, control and modelling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032122000478","1364-0321","2022","112119","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews"

Its usage is opening both opportunities such as new business models and economic gains and risks such as privacy violations and discrimination. Europe is in need of a comprehensive strategy to optimise the use of data for a societal benefit and increase the innovation and competitiveness of its productive activities. In this paper, we contribute to the definition of this strategy with a research roadmap to capture the economic, social and ethical, legal and political benefits associated with the use of big data in Europe. The present roadmap considers the positive and negative externalities associated with big data, maps research and innovation topics in the areas of data management, processing, analytics, protection, visualisation, as well as non-technical topics, to the externalities they can tackle, and provides a time frame to address these topics in order to deliver social impact, skills development and standardisation. Finally, it also identifies what sectors will be most benefited by each of the research efforts. The goal of the roadmap is to guide European research efforts to develop a socially responsible big data economy, and to allow stakeholders to identify and meet big data challenges and proceed with a shared understanding of the societal impact, positive and negative externalities and concrete problems worth investigating in future programmes.","","article","","54","","","The societal impact of big data: A research roadmap for Europe","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X17300131","0160-791X","2018","74-86","Technology in Society"

However, bearing equipment is in normal working state for most of the time and operates under variable operating conditions. This makes it difficult to obtain bearing data labels, and the distribution of the collected samples varies widely. To address these problems, an unsupervised cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on time-frequency information fusion is proposed in this paper. Firstly, wavelet packet decomposition and reconstruction are carried out on the bearing vibration signal, and the energy eigenvectors of each sub-band are extracted to obtain a 2-D time-frequency map of fault features. Secondly, an unsupervised cross-domain fault diagnosis model is constructed, the improved maximum mean discrepancy algorithm is used as the measurement standard, and the joint distribution distance is calculated with the help of pseudo-labels to reduce data distribution differences. Finally, the model is applied to the motor bearing for comparison and verification. The results demonstrate its high diagnosis accuracy and strong robustness.","","article","","360","","","Unsupervised cross-domain rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on time-frequency information fusion","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003222008055","0016-0032","2023","1454-1477","Journal of the Franklin Institute"

We used three spatial resolutions from different DEMs: (1) LIDAR – 2 m; (2) ALOS PALSAR – 12.5 and 30 m; (3) SRTM – 30 m; and (4) ASTER GDEM – 30 m.

The prediction of soil classes was performed using the terrain attributes grouped as to sensitivity to resolution, for different spatial resolutions, applying the machine learning algorithms Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The cluster analysis indicated that most attributes remained within the same group of resolution sensitivity with changes in the cell size of reference DEM. The attributes of the terrain grouped low sensitive to resolution derived from the SRTM DEM showed better precision and the main advantage was the low cost and facilitating computational processing for application in the DSM.","","article","","21","","","Analysis of terrain attributes in different spatial resolutions for digital soil mapping application in southeastern Brazil","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352009420300171","2352-0094","2020","e00268","Geoderma Regional"

Therefore, data imputation can be an integral part of pre-processing before data mining. It is widely known that IoT time series show strong dependencies in both spatial and temporal dimension, and the spatial relation among the devices is in non-euclidean space. However, most machine-learning-based and deep-learning-based approaches either only take temporal features into account or only catch spatial features in euclidean space. In this paper, we propose a novel network as ST-VAE (Spatio-Temporal Variational Auto-Encoder) to address the problem above. Our architecture is mainly based on Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). Specifically, two kinds of VAE are utilized. One is for calculating the adjacent matrix of device network which is the essential input of GCN, and the other is for data imputation task based on the spatial and temporal dependencies. Experiments conducted on different real-world and public datasets demonstrate that our ST-VAE can not only populate the missing spatio-temporal data accurately but also outperforms other state-of-art approaches from the whole.","","article","","529","","","Data imputation in IoT using Spatio-Temporal Variational Auto-Encoder","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231223000322","0925-2312","2023","23-32","Neurocomputing"

A life-cycle model was developed to assess 27 alternative retrofit scenarios combining three types of insulation material (rock wool, extruded polystyrene and polyurethane foam), three insulation levels (40, 80 and 120 mm) and three types of frame material (wood, light steel and lightweight concrete). The functional unit selected for this study was 1 square meter of living area over a period of 50 years. Life-cycle (LC) impact assessment results were calculated for six categories showing that wood scenarios had the lowest impacts (all categories). The use phase accounted for 60–70% of the LC impacts in all categories. The results also showed that for insulation thicknesses of 80 mm or more, the reduction in operational energy, due to a further increase of 40 mm, is not significant (5% or less), while the embodied impacts increase from 6 to 20%.

The observed sensitivity is caused by the combined effect of: 1) The amount effect in tropical precipitation; 2) Dilution of the isotopically heavy saline surface waters with light precipitation; 3) A salinity effect on the biosynthetic D/H fractionation between lipid and lake water. Both lake water δD (δDLake) and δDDino could be expressed as a quadratic function of either precipitation or lake water salinity. δDDino values were used to reconstruct past hydrological changes of the region. Long-term variations in the strength and sign of the El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) since the Little Ice Age (LIA, ∼1450–1850 A.D.) and during the early Holocene (∼7–9 kyr BP) appeared to dominate decadal variability, and indicate very dry conditions during the LIA. Early Holocene δDDino values were on average ∼10‰ higher than those of recent centuries, which we interpret as a result of millennial scale hydrologic and water mass changes on a global level. The similar ∼35‰ range of δD changes during the early Holocene and last several centuries imply a similar range of decadal-centennial hydrologic variability during those two climate regimes. Our results indicate that a correlation exists between solar irradiance levels and tropical Pacific climate.","","article","","30","","","Compound-specific D/H ratios of the marine lakes of Palau as proxies for West Pacific Warm Pool hydrologic variability","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379111000278","0277-3791","2011","921-933","Quaternary Science Reviews"

In this paper, a new methodology is presented which, on the basis of microwave satellite observations, could permit us to monitor soil wetness variations at a global scale. The proposed method seems able to overcome the problems connected to surface roughness and vegetation cover that mainly limit the soil moisture estimations from satellite in the microwave region. Preliminary results achieved for the flooding event which occurred in the Carpathian basin (Hungary) in April 2000 will be described in detail. They seem to confirm the reliability of the proposed technique in the identification of different amounts of soil wetness, not only during and after the considered event, but, in order to possibly use it for warning system purposes, in the phase preceding the event as well. Such an approach is automatic and, for construction, globally exportable. Moreover, because of the complete independence from the specific satellite platform, such a technique could be easily exported to the new generation of satellite sensors with improved performances like AMSR-E aboard EOS-Aqua and MIRAS aboard SMOS.","","article","","96","","","Improving soil wetness variations monitoring from passive microwave satellite data: The case of April 2000 Hungary flood","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425705000507","0034-4257","2005","135-148","Remote Sensing of Environment"

In order to test whether these changes were triggered by abrupt climate change events in the North Atlantic Ocean, variations in precipitation during the last deglaciation (18–10 ka) were extracted from proxy records of chemical weathering and terrigenous input in the western Philippine Sea (WPS). The evolution of chemical weathering and terrigenous input since 27 ka was reconstructed using the chemical index of alteration (CIA), elemental ratios (K/Al, TOC/TN and Ti/Ca), δ13Corg, terrigenous fraction abundance and flux data from International Marine Global Change Study Program (IMAGES) core MD06-3054 collected on the upper continental slope of eastern Luzon (northern Philippines). Sediment deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) shows weathering equal to or slightly greater than Holocene sediment in the WPS. This unusual state of chemical weathering, which is inconsistent with lower air temperatures and decreased precipitation in Luzon during the LGM, may be due to reworking of poorly consolidated sediments on the eastern Luzon continental shelf during the LGM sea-level lowstand. Rapid changes in chemical weathering, characterized by higher intensity during the Heinrich event 1 (H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) and lower intensity during the Bølling-Allerød (B/A), were linked to rapid variations in precipitation in the WPS during the last deglaciation. The higher terrigenous inputs during the LGM relative to those of the Holocene were controlled by sea-level changes rather than precipitation. The terrigenous inputs show a long-term decline during the last deglaciation, punctuated by brief spikes during the H1 and YD related to sea-level rises and rapid precipitation changes in the WPS, respectively. The proxy records of chemical weathering and terrigenous input from eastern Luzon suggest high rainfall during the H1 and YD events, consistent with inferred rainfall patterns based on Fe/Ca records from offshore Mindanao. Rapid precipitation changes in the WPS did not coincide with migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) but, rather, were related to state shifts of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the last deglaciation. Based on proxy records and modeling results, we argue that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) controlled rapid precipitation changes in the tropical West Pacific through zonal shifts of ENSO or meridional migration of the ITCZ during the last deglaciation. Our findings highlight the dominant role of the North Atlantic Ocean in the tropical hydrologic cycle during the last deglaciation.","","article","","197","","","Rapid precipitation changes in the tropical West Pacific linked to North Atlantic climate forcing during the last deglaciation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379117309484","0277-3791","2018","288-306","Quaternary Science Reviews"

To our knowledge these are the first measurements of aerosol concentrations in this unique environment. The particles with marine origin displayed a tri-modal number size distribution with peak diameters of 0.016 μm, 0.050 μm and 0.174 μm and a cloud-processed intermodal minimum at 0.093 μm. The mean total aerosol number concentration for the marine contribution was 470 ± 160 cm−3. A low particle concentration of 70 ± 50 cm−3 for the nucleation size range was measured, but no evidence of new particle production in the atmospheric marine boundary layer (MBL) was observed. The concentration of the Aitken size mode was found to be related to aerosol entrainment from the free troposphere off the coast of Chile followed by transport within the MBL to the Galápagos Islands. Cloud processing may activate the particles in the Aitken size range, growing through ‘in-cloud’ sulphate production and increasing the particle concentration in the accumulation size range. The 0.093 μm cloud processed minima suggests that the critical supersaturation at which the particle is activated to a cloud droplet is in the 0.14–0.21% range. The daytime marine particle background concentration was influenced by human activity around the sampling site, as well as by new particle formation triggered by biogenic emissions from the vegetation cover of the island's semiarid lowlands. Effective CCN formation may play a role in the formation and properties of the stratus clouds, which permanently cover the top of the windward side of the islands and establish one of their characteristic climatic bands.","","article","","123","","","On the concentration and size distribution of sub-micron aerosol in the Galápagos Islands","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231015304477","1352-2310","2015","39-48","Atmospheric Environment"

To our knowledge, only two tropical system and two temperate systems of such seeps have been described worldwide. Here we describe two new temperate systems: the Mikama Bay and Ashitsuke sites, located on Shikine Island, Japan. The Mikama Bay site is located in a shallow bay. Investigation of the gas and water chemistry showed that the gas contained 98% CO2 and up to 90 ppm H2S. Total alkalinity was constant in time and space with an average of 2265±10 μ mol kg−1. Mapping of Eh and pH showed that the low pH zones were the largest when currents were moderate. Under moderate currents, Eh values were globally higher and total sulfides concentration lower, supporting that a longer residence time of the bay water allow the oxidation of the sulfides to sulfates. Zones suitable for acidification studies: with a pH lower than 8.0, low saturation state of calcite and aragonite, and non-detectable sulfide concentration, can be defined a few meters from the main venting zone. The second site, Ashitsuke, is located in the inter-tidal zone on a shore composed of boulders. Several areas showed reduced pH sometimes restricted to a few meters and up to 20 m long along the shoreline. Temperature was higher in some of the reduced pH zones suggesting the presence of hot springs in addition to vents. This paper also highlights the need for discovering additional CO2 seeps, which by their nature often lack comparable replicates and can be confounded by factors other than CO2. In this regard, Japan offers great potential as it is home to numerous active volcanoes, representing potential venting sites in climates ranging from tropical to sub-polar.","","article","","2","","","Geochemistry of two shallow CO2 seeps in Shikine Island (Japan) and their potential for ocean acidification research","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352485515000298","2352-4855","2015","45-53","Regional Studies in Marine Science"

Moreover, six hash functions are designed carefully and skillfully, three of which may generate uniform outputs, the other three hash functions take a combination of some special substrings from the input as their outputs. Although the algorithm does not explicitly preserve any host address, it can reconstruct IP addresses by combining some specific substrings of function values. Furthermore, we make a validation on reconstructed IP addresses to filter out non-existing IP addresses and make some bit-AND operations on virtual bitmaps of each IP address to filter out the noise, improving the accuracy of our algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate our algorithm can achieve the same accuracy as or higher accuracy than other algorithms while reducing 50% of memory consumption compared with CSE (Compact Spread Estimator) and reducing 80% of memory consumption compared with VBF (Vector Bloom Filter).","","article","","49","","","A novel algorithm for detecting superpoints based on reversible virtual bitmaps","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214212619303205","2214-2126","2019","102403","Journal of Information Security and Applications"

These changes require skills from the leaders in intuitive emergency response that positively correspond to the team behavior. Conceptual and/or mathematical models are elaborated to simulate human behavior, identifying possible failures from workers, anticipating an occurrence. The industry needs discussions about emerging social or individual movements to predict future failures. Risk management and analysis of events that compose the accident indicate the importance of signals in the analysis of the failure anatomy. Human reliability programs measure operational failure rate, likelihood of human error, mean time between failures, social relationships at workstation, and the impact on task success. Complex processes require higher perception of the anatomy of failure and demand new competence to perform the task, which require worker’s mental and physical health. There are pathologies that affect the worker and induce human errors. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and diagnose the human factors that are part of the activity in the workstation. In the discussion of human reliability, a historical view of schools, worldwide, related to this area of knowledge is presented. In view of interpretations from contents taught in schools and the expertise of researchers and specialists, the following is highlighted this chapter: worker’s relationships in the workstation, the execution of the task scheduled in routine and in emergencies. This chapter concludes with a discussion on risk management in process losses related to low human reliability in organizations.","","incollection","Elsevier","","Human Factor and Reliability Analysis to Prevent Losses in Industrial Processes","978-0-12-819650-2","Chapter 1 - Introduction","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128196502000092","","2022","1-24",""

Observations made along the ferry transect reveal characteristic phenomena such as high salinity inflow through the Channel into the Southern Bight, algal bloom dynamics and related oxygen and pH changes. Combination of these online observations with remote sensing enhances the spatial resolution of the transect related measurements. Several examples of the synergy between these two measuring strategies are shown, both for large-scale algal blooms in the North Sea as well as for local intense but short-term blooms in the German Bight. Coherence of the data sets can be gained and improved by using water transport models in order to obtain synoptic overviews of the remotely sensed and FerryBox related parameters. Limitations of the currently used algorithms for deriving chlorophyll-a from remote sensing images for coastal and shelf seas (Case-2 water) are discussed, as well as depth related processes which cannot be properly resolved on the basis of water intake at a fixed point. However, in unstratified coastal waters under normal conditions FerryBox data represent average conditions.

Previous studies have suggested that the presence of surfactants in coastal aerosols may result in vegetation damage without specifically detecting or quantifying these surfactants. Coastal aerosols were collected at a remote site (Porquerolles Island-Var, France) and at a more anthropised site (San Rossore National Park-Tuscany, Italy). The chemical data were interpreted according to a comprehensive local meteorological analysis aiming to decipher the airborne source and transport processes of these classes of compounds. The LAS concentration (anthropogenic surfactants) was measured in the samples using LC-MS/MS, a specific analytical method. The values were compared with the MBAS concentration, determined by a non-specific analytical method. At Porquerolles, the MBAS concentration (103 ± 93 ng m−3) in the summer samples was significantly higher than in the winter samples. In contrast, LAS concentrations were rarely greater than in the blank filters. At San Rossore, the mean annual MBAS concentration (887 ± 473 ng m−3 in PM10) contributed about 10% to the total atmospheric particulate organic matter. LAS mean concentration in these same aerosol samples was 11.5 ± 10.5 ng m−3. A similar MBAS (529 ± 454 ng m−3) – LAS (7.1 ± 4.1 ng m−3 LAS) ratio of ∼75 was measured in the fine (PM2.5) aerosol fraction. No linear correlation was found between MBAS and LAS concentrations. At San Rossore site the variation of LAS concentrations was studied on a daily basis over a year. The LAS concentrations in the coarse fraction (PM10–2.5) were higher during strong sea storm conditions, characterized by strong air flow coming from the sea sector. These events, occurring with more intensity in winter, promoted the formation of primary marine aerosols containing LAS from the sea surface microlayer. In contrast to LAS, MBAS concentrations in the coarse fraction peaked in summer. Therefore, different sources are suggested for the two classes of compounds. In summer, increased MBAS concentration could be an indicator of phytoplanktonic blows enriching the sea surface microlayer with biogenic surfactants. In winter, some spikes in MBAS concentrations in the coarse fraction could be related to LAS concentrations and sea storm events. Moreover, in the fine fraction MBAS have a large concentration maxima in winter, corresponding to air masses coming from polluted continental areas. It is concluded that MBAS concentration in the fine or the coarse fraction is not an appropriate surrogate measurement of LAS concentration in aerosols because of the significant contribution from other sources to the MBAS concentration.","","article","","45","","","MBAS (Methylene Blue Active Substances) and LAS (Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonates) in Mediterranean coastal aerosols: Sources and transport processes","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231011004195","1352-2310","2011","6788-6801","Atmospheric Environment"

A strong relationship between the anthropogenic emission factors (contribution from local and regional coal combustion processes) and low temperature was identified for all the examined snow episodes. The highest Hg concentration in the urban snow samples was observed during the southern advection, which indicated that local/regional anthropogenic emission predominantly affected the Hg deposition.

The floating offshore installations may be subjected to severe marine environmental conditions. Accidents such as collisions may also occur. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a viable tool to maintain safe operation of offshore installations. Inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) is one of the most powerful methods for SHM process. Hence, this study focuses on the application of iFEM methodology to thin-walled cylindrical structures representing the columns of floating offshore installations. iFEM methodology is verified by comparing its displacement results against reference finite element method (FEM) solution. After this verification, four different damage cases with different size, location and number of damages are considered. By using a newly introduced damage parameter and von Mises strain distribution iFEM accurately identified the correct damage locations and sizes. Therefore, it is concluded that iFEM can be used for structural damage prediction in offshore structures with high accuracy even if the number of the strain sensors is limited.","","article","","198","","","Dent damage identification in stiffened cylindrical structures using inverse Finite Element Method","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801820300275","0029-8018","2020","106944","Ocean Engineering"

In this study, two 6-m cores from the Badain Jaran desert (NW China) were collected to explore this potential using directly extracted moisture. Pore waters in these unsaturated zone sediments (1–5% moisture by wet weight) were directly extracted using immiscible liquid displacement and then analysed for major anions, cations and trace elements. Results show enrichment in pore water chemistry in the top 1–2 m where strong temperature and moisture fluxes occur. The enrichment in cations relative to chloride is primarily due to silicate mineral dissolution during infiltration. High nitrate and low iron concentrations indicate the overall oxidizing environment, which allows the mobility of oxyanions, such as uranium, arsenic and chromium. The trace elements show enrichment in the upper zone of fluctuation where chemical gradients are strong, but with lesser reaction lower in the profile. The calculated groundwater recharge rates using the chloride mass balance are negligible in this arid region between 1.5 and 3.0 mm/year. The modern rainfall infiltration signature contrasts with that of the underlying groundwater body, which has a distant, regional recharge signature. This reconnaissance study demonstrates the potential for a new geochemical approach to studying geochemical processes in the unsaturated sediments in semi-arid environments due to both natural and human influences. The use of directly extracted water, rather than extraction by dilution (elutriation), facilitates an improved understanding of hydrological and geochemical processes in the unsaturated zone and into the capillary fringe at the water table, because it avoids potential chemical changes induced during elutriation.","","article","","63","","","Geochemistry of sediment moisture in the Badain Jaran desert: Implications of recent environmental changes and water-rock interaction","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292715300408","0883-2927","2015","235-247","Applied Geochemistry"

At all sites, molecular (C1/C2+ ratios⩾600) and isotopic (δ13CCH4, δDCH4 and δ13CC2H6) indicators point to a microbial source of methane and ethane. Similarly, at all sites the δ13CCH4 and δ13CCO2 have minimum values at the sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ) throughout the basin. These data document intense carbon cycling at this horizon, whereby anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at the SMTZ generates a dissolved inorganic carbon pool depleted in 13C that is subsequently reduced to generate the observed minima in δ13CCH4. At the background sites, the carbon isotope fractionation factor (εc=δ13CCO2−δ13CCH4) for all gases ranges from 56–66, consistent with values predicted for methanogenesis driven predominantly by microbial CO2 reduction. However, εc values measured in the two acoustic chimney sites that contain gas hydrate are significantly lower (30–46). We conclude that these abnormally small εc values reflect two phase fluid transport at gas hydrate bearing sites. The composition of the hydrocarbons sampled below the SMTZ at these sites (higher C2+ abundance and δ13C enriched methane) indicates a deep source origin for the microbial gas, which we postulate migrates upwardly and sustains the gas hydrate formation near the seafloor. If so, abnormally small εc values can be used as a potential geochemical indicator for the migration of methane in the gas phase and the consequent development of gas hydrate accumulations in shallow marine systems.","","article","","43","","","Inferences on gas transport based on molecular and isotopic signatures of gases at acoustic chimneys and background sites in the Ulleung Basin","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146638011002993","0146-6380","2012","26-38","Organic Geochemistry"

We attempt to fill this knowledge gap by reviewing and compiling the existing scientific literature on methods, including ground-based measurements (e.g. gauging stations, wireless sensor network) and remote sensing observations (e.g. from topographic LiDAR, multispectral and radar sensors) that have been used and/or can be relevant to monitor the performance of NBS against five HMRs: floods, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion. These can allow the mapping of the risks and impacts of the specific hydro-meteorological events. We found that the selection and application of monitoring methods mostly rely on the particular NBS being monitored, resource availability (e.g. time, budget, space) and type of HMRs. No standalone method currently exists that can allow monitoring the performance of NBS in its broadest view. However, equipments, tools and technologies developed for other purposes, such as for ground-based measurements and atmospheric observations, can be applied to accurately monitor the performance of NBS to mitigate HMRs. We also focused on the capabilities of passive and active remote sensing, pointing out their associated opportunities and difficulties for NBS monitoring application. We conclude that the advancement in airborne and satellite-based remote sensing technology has signified a leap in the systematic monitoring of NBS performance, as well as provided a robust way for the spatial and temporal comparison of NBS intervention versus its absence. This improved performance measurement can support the evaluation of existing uncertainty and scepticism in selecting NBS over the artificially built concrete structures or grey approaches by addressing the questions of performance precariousness. Remote sensing technical developments, however, take time to shift toward a state of operational readiness for monitoring the progress of NBS in place (e.g. green NBS growth rate, their changes and effectiveness through time). More research is required to develop a holistic approach, which could routinely and continually monitor the performance of NBS over a large scale of intervention. This performance evaluation could increase the ecological and socio-economic benefits of NBS, and also create high levels of their acceptance and confidence by overcoming potential scepticism of NBS implementations.","","article","","217","","","An overview of monitoring methods for assessing the performance of nature-based solutions against natural hazards","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221001033","0012-8252","2021","103603","Earth-Science Reviews"

In commercial fisheries attention is increasingly directed to species historically being of secondary importance and potentially being influenced by these drivers. We present long-term commercial fisheries data of North Sea whiting (Merlangius merlangus), comprising international catches (1903–2010), quotas (1980–2010), and British otter trawler data (landings-per-unit-effort (lpue) for 1923–2009 at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles). Based on lpue data, we tested the possible effects of climate change and fishing pressure on whiting distribution. Results showed no distinct latitudinal and deepening shifts, but a ∼1° westward shift between the late-1940s and 1960s. Relations to climate change and fishing pressure were not strong. The lack of clear latitudinal and deepening shifts contrasts with recent studies on other North Sea species reporting such shifts related to temperature change. The North Sea is at the centre of the distribution range of whiting, and the temperature changes might still fall well within the physiological tolerance limits of this species, hence not affecting the distribution.

This type of energy requires an efficient storage system that will allow its use when the sunset or during cloudy weather. Hence, 0-48 hours forecast lead time is crucial for electrical network managers to anticipate energy deficits during periods of cloud occurrence. This study presents a new approach to forecast solar irradiances using a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model outputs, coupled with a Radiative Transfer operator, namely libRadtran. The NWP model used in this study is the WRF-Solar configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), designed for solar energy in order to forecast solar irradiances. The other parameters forecasted by WRF like the vertical profiles of cloud liquid water (CLW), cloud ice water (IWC), clouds fraction, relative humidity, and temperature will be used as input for libRadtran to compute off-line the solar irradiances. Both forecasted irradiances were first compared with the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version-2 (MERRA-2) data, then validated a second time by ground measurements for three locations in Algeria for the years 2016 and 2017. The results clearly show that the solar irradiances forecasted directly by WRF-Solar underestimate the MERRA-2 data for high solar zenith angles. With regard to the proposed approach, there is an improvement in the forecast of the solar irradiances during clear sky days and the rRMSE of the calculated Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) reaches 12% in winter and increases to 22% in summer.","","article","","221","","","A new approach to forecast solar irradiances using WRF and libRadtran models, validated with MERRA-2 reanalysis data and pyranometer measures","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X2100311X","0038-092X","2021","148-161","Solar Energy"

These Zeonor® substrates do not possess native functional groups for specific reactions with biomolecules. Therefore, depending on the application, such substrates must be functionalized by surface chemistry methods to either enhance or suppress biomolecular adsorption. This work demonstrates a microfluidic method for evaluating the adsorption of antibodies and oligonucleotides surfaces. The method uses centrifugal microfluidic flow-through chips and can easily be implemented using common equipment such as a spin coater. The working principle is very simple. The user adds 40L of the solution containing the sample to the starting side of a microfluidic channel, where it is moved through by centrifugal force. Some molecules are adsorbed in the channel. The sample is then collected at the other end in a small reservoir and the biomolecule concentration is measured. As a pilot application, we characterized the adsorption of goat anti-human IgG and a 20-mer DNA on Zeonor®, and on three types of functionalized Zeonor: 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) modified surface with mainly positive charge, negatively charged surface with immobilized bovine serum albumin (BSA), and neutral, hydrogel-like film with polyethylene glycol (PEG) characteristics. This simple analytical approach adds to the fundamental understanding of the interaction forces in real, microfluidic systems. This method provides a straightforward and rapid way to screen surface compositions and chemistry, and relate these to their effects on the sensitivity and resistance to non-specific binding of bioassays using them. In an additional set of experiments, the surface area of the channels in this universal microfluidic chip was increased by precision milling of microscale trenches. This modified surface was then coated with APTES and tested for its potential to serve as a unique protein dilution feature.","","article","","760","","","Simple approach to study biomolecule adsorption in polymeric microfluidic channels","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267012017060","0003-2670","2013","75-82","Analytica Chimica Acta"

It is Nigeria's oil and gas hub and hot spot of biodiversity, including endemics. The region is, therefore, critically strategic for conservation of environmental quality, especially biodiversity, of the Gulf of Guinea. However, the delta's environmental integrity has been heavily impacted by numerous human activities particularly oil and gas industrialization and local livelihood resource extraction. Government agencies, educational and research institutions as well as independent researchers have not been able to study and monitor the environmental quality of the Niger Delta coast in sufficient detail. Lack of requisite human resources (technical expertise and number of personnel), gaps in sampling and analytical tools, inadequate government and non-governmental incentives, poor funding, insecurity and the remoteness of some of the coastal environments are the major challenges. The need to involve multiple stakeholders, including ordinary citizens in monitoring and reporting changes in the Niger Delta coastal land- and seascape is stressed. Leveraging on two empirical case studies, this paper discusses the prospects and challenges anticipated with the novelty of engaging community science (non-scientists) in monitoring environmental, especially biodiversity changes in the Niger Delta region.

Pertinently, satellite data assimilation approaches are essential for improved land surface modelling for northern high latitudes ecosystems where permafrost degradation is reported to be ongoing. Permafrost, however, is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) that cannot directly be monitored from space. Here, we advocate that CDRs, such as those compiled under the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, may be used in combination with permafrost models to improve our understanding of permafrost extent and degradation in a changing climate system. We describe the current types of remotely-sensed surface feature products that are widely used as indicators for permafrost related features. Furthermore, we highlight issues of using these site-specific permafrost proxies related to spatial scale, as well as the uncertainties in establishing present-day permafrost extent itself. Our assessment of the key ECVs that impact on permafrost, demonstrates how models that incorporate EO CDRs have the potential to boost our knowledge of permafrost conditions through better parametrisation of the thermal regime of permafrost soils.","","article","","203","","","Progress in space-borne studies of permafrost for climate science: Towards a multi-ECV approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302201","0034-4257","2017","55-70","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Long-term AOD trends across the globe are obtained from the multi-satellite measurements that include MODerate resolution Imaging Spectral-radiometer (MODIS on-board Terra (T) and Aqua (A), between 2001 and 2020), Multi-angle Imaging Spectral-Radiometer (MISR, 2001–2020), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP, 2006–2020) observations using both the linear as well as multivariate regression analysis. Before evaluating the trends, a detailed comparison has been made with the ground-based AEronet RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations (2001–2020) obtained from more than 80 stations covering the globe. A high (above 0.7) to medium (from 0.3 to 0.7) spatial correlation is noticed among all the satellite measurements except the CALIOP (over a few sites) observations. However, MISR (CALIOP) observed AOD values underestimated (overestimated) with that measured by the AERONET AOD over the high aerosol loaded regions. In addition, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application version-2 (MERRA-2) AOD dataset is also able to simulate the mean as well as trend values across the globe. A decreasing trend in AOD is mostly seen in connection with the implementation of emission control policies (Eastern North America, Europe, and Eastern and Central China), reduction in forest fires (South America), and the stilling of surface winds over arid regions (Western North Africa). On the other hand, AOD trends perceived over the South Africa region have increased in comparison to the values reported earlier. Surprisingly, the CALIOP sensor has shown a rather significantly decreasing trend values over the Middle-East region. When compared, the region-wise linear regression trend analysis declined to give any statistically significant values over huge aerosol variability regions such as North Africa, South Africa, Middle-East, China, and the Indian regions. These robust findings will form a firm basis to evaluate the dependence of physical and chemical characteristics of aerosol on the observed AOD trends so that the impact of varied aerosols emission sources can be quantified accurately across the different regions.","","article","","273","","","Long-term trends in Aerosol Optical Depth obtained across the globe using multi-satellite measurements","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231022000188","1352-2310","2022","118953","Atmospheric Environment"

However, the existing recognition methods mainly focus on common faults with enough data, which ignore that many faults are lack of samples in engineering practice. Transfer learning can be helpful, but irrelevant knowledge transfer can cause performance degradation, especially in complex systems. To address the above problem, a hierarchy guided transfer learning framework (HGTL) is proposed in this paper for fault recognition with few-shot samples. Firstly, we fuse domain knowledge, label semantics and inter-class distance to calculate the affinity between categories, based on which a category hierarchical tree is constructed by hierarchical clustering. Then, guided by the hierarchical structure, the samples in most similar majority classes are selected from the source domain to pre-train the hierarchical feature learning network (HFN) and extract the transferable fault information. For the fault knowledge extracted from the child nodes of one parent node are similar and can be transferred with each other, so the trained HFN can extract better features of few samples classes with the help of the information from similar faults, and used to address few-shot fault recognition problems. Finally, a dataset of a nuclear power system with 65 categories and the widely used Tennessee Eastman dataset are analyzed respectively via the proposed method, as well as state-of-the-art recognition methods for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in fault recognition with few-shot problem.","","article","","123","","","Majorities help minorities: Hierarchical structure guided transfer learning for few-shot fault recognition","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003132032100563X","0031-3203","2022","108383","Pattern Recognition"

However, these analyses often quantify risk based on temporally static or spatially coarse measures of species distributions and human activity. As a result, risk estimates often do not reflect the dynamic nature of animal movement and anthropogenic uses of the environment. To illustrate the impacts of various temporal resolutions of data, we present a case study of blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) ship strike risk in the U.S. Southern California Bight by combining predicted daily whale distributions with continuous vessel movement data. This represents the first effort to characterize blue whale ship strike risk by including the most recent high-resolution estimates of eastern Pacific blue whale distribution. We used these data to compare the ship strike risk models at varying temporal resolutions to address the effect of using coarser resolution input data. Our results show that it is critical to account for both dynamic patterns of human activity and species occurrences when assessing the risk of human-wildlife conflict. Analysis based on higher resolutions of potential interactions show greater variability in risk. Coarser resolution data mask variability in risk that may result from patchy conditions of blue whale habitat and/or variations in vessel traffic. We also demonstrate that coarser temporal resolutions lead to overestimations of risk. For highly mobile species subject to human-wildlife interactions such as blue whales, long-term environmental solutions depend on matching ecological data to human activity data at the most appropriate scale.","","article","","250","","","Combining high temporal resolution whale distribution and vessel tracking data improves estimates of ship strike risk","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720308156","0006-3207","2020","108757","Biological Conservation"

Analyses of GridSat-B1 and MODIS satellite datasets in conjunction with ERA5 reanalysis data show that cloud cover has decreased, and brightness temperature (Tb) has increased during the morning hours, while convective activity has increased and Tb has decreased during the afternoon hours, possibly due to the observed warming and drying trend over the Congo. The combined effects of decreasing clouds during the morning and the subsequent increasing convection during the afternoon have led to an amplification of the diurnal amplitude in Tb over the Congo. Our results also indicate a decrease in precipitation efficiency and an increase in cloud base height. Such changes may be attributable to the Congo drought as increased surface temperatures and decreased surface relative humidity would raise the lifted condensation level, and thus increase the cloud base height and decrease the precipitation efficiency. This positive-feedback mechanism may ultimately result in the observed decrease of precipitation at the surface, further accelerating the drying trend over the Congo.","","article","","264","","","A shift in the diurnal timing and intensity of deep convection over the Congo Basin during the past 40 years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809521004257","0169-8095","2021","105869","Atmospheric Research"

Chronic life-cycle exposure to environmental relevant concentrations of both EDCs led to significant effects on reproduction and embryonic development. TBT exposure at 50 ng/L impacted the percentage of fertilized eggs. EE2 exposure at 0.75 and 1.75 ng/L and the mixture treatments (0.75 and 1.75 ng/L EE2 plus 50 ng/L TBT) led to a sex bias towards females. Furthermore, EE2 exposure at 1.75 ng/L and the mixture of EE2 (1.75 ng/L) and TBT (50 ng/L) impaired embryonic development. The study of DNA repair pathways indicated that EE2 and TBT, single and combined, significantly modulated the expression levels of key DNA repair genes in male gonads, such as xpc nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway gene as well as the tumor suppressor p53, its target effectors, i.e. p21, gadd45α and bax, and p53 key regulator (mdm2). The observed impact in the transcription of these genes supports the hypothesis of an effect of EE2, TBT, and their combined mixtures, on DNA repair pathways, thus suggesting that impairment of embryonic development of F2 generation could be linked to the disruption of DNA repair processes in the gonads of individuals from the parental generation.

This article describes the Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission that is designed to provide precision sea level, sea surface height, significant wave height, inland water heights and other products tailored to operational services in the ocean, climate, atmospheric and land Copernicus Services. Sentinel-6 provides enhanced continuity to the very stable time series of mean sea level measurements and ocean sea state started in 1992 by the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and follow-on Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions. The mission is implemented through a unique international partnership with contributions from NASA, NOAA, ESA, EUMETSAT, and the European Union (EU). It includes two satellites that will fly sequentially (separated in time by 5 years). The first satellite, named Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched from Vandenburg Air Force Base, USA on 21st November 2020. The satellite and payload elements are explained including required performance and their operation. The main payload is the Poseidon-4 dual frequency (C/Ku-band) nadir-pointing radar altimeter that uses an innovative interleaved mode. This enables radar data processing on two parallel chains the first provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing in Ku-band to improve the received altimeter echoes through better along-track sampling and reduced measurement noise; the second provides a Low Resolution Mode that is fully backward-compatible with the historical reference altimetry measurements, allowing a complete inter-calibration between the state-of-the-art data and the historical record. A three-channel Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMRC) provides measurements of atmospheric water vapour to mitigate degradation of the radar altimeter measurements. The main data products are explained and preliminary in-orbit Poseidon-4 altimeter data performance data are presented that demonstrate the altimeter to be performing within expectations.","","article","","258","","","The Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission: Enhanced continuity of satellite sea level measurements from space","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425721001139","0034-4257","2021","112395","Remote Sensing of Environment"

One of the important problems during the PSM of SBP is that due to significantly large number of SBPs on a process facility it is very difficult to place sensors at small bore connection (SBC) for stress estimation. In absence of the stress values, it is difficult to estimate the remaining fatigue life (RFL) of SBC which further impedes the inspection planning. Thus, in this chapter, a methodology comprising of CFD, FEA and Machine Learning is used to obtain a virtual sensor for estimating stress at the SBC. The input to the virtual sensor is process parameters such as pressure and flow velocity, while the output is the maximum Von-Mises stress at the SBC. Thereafter, probabilistic crack growth law coupled with Bayesian Network is used to develop a DT for RFL estimation of SBP, which in turn is used to obtain reliability curves and inspection plans. Online deployment of the developed DT will give an up-to-date RFL estimates and inspection plans which can be used then be used for PSM of the SBP.","","incollection","Elsevier","6","Methods to Assess and Manage Process Safety in Digitalized Process System","","Chapter Sixteen - Use of digital twins for process safety management","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468651422000113","2468-6514","2022","561-589",""

Major- and trace-element compositions of representative peridotite xenolith are documented for four occurrences located in different structural units of the continental margin. In each locality, the majority of xenoliths have distinctive microstructures, modal and chemical compositions that are typical for a given xenolith suite. Significant textural and compositional differences between the four xenolith suites suggest that the upper mantle beneath the Sikhote-Alin consists of distinct domains with contrasting composition. The inferred large-scale mantle heterogeneities may be due to juxtaposition of lithospheric blocks of different provenance during accretion of the Sikhote-Alin to the Asian continent. Trace-element patterns of the xenoliths and their minerals obtained ICP-MS technique provide evidence of depletion and enrichment events and indicate contrasting behaviour of REE, HFSE and other incompatible trace elements. The HFSE behave non-concordantly, in particular, some xenoliths have highly fractionated Zr/Hf, Ti/Zr, Nb/Ta, La/Nb and U/Th ratios relative to their values in the primitive mantle. The fractionated compositions may be related to the interaction of evolved subduction-related fluids and melts with lithospheric mantle at the Mesozoic-early Cenozoic active continental margin or to metasomatism during later continental rifting.","","article","","120","","","Peridotite xenoliths in alkali basalts from the Sikhote-Alin, southeastern Siberia, Russia: trace-element signatures of mantle beneath a convergent continental margin","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000925419400142U","0009-2541","1995","275-294","Chemical Geology"

Traditionally, it has been assumed that most of the Tröllaskagi glaciers reached their Late Holocene maximum extent during the Little Ice Age (LIA). However, there is evidence of slightly more advanced pre-LIA positions. LIA moraines from Iceland have been primary dated mostly through lichenometric dating, but the limitations of this technique do not allow dating of glacial advances prior to the 18th or 19th centuries. The application of 36Cl Cosmic-Ray Exposure (CRE) dating to Tungnahryggsjökull moraine sequences in Vesturdalur and Austurdalur (central Tröllaskagi) has revealed a number of pre-LIA glacial advances at ~400 and ~700 CE, and a number of LIA advances in the 15th and 17th centuries, the earliest LIA advances dated so far in Tröllaskagi. This technique hence shows that the LIA chronology in Tröllaskagi agrees with that of other European areas such as the Alps or the Mediterranean mountains. The combined use of lichenometric dating, aerial photographs, satellite images and fieldwork shows that the regional colonization lag of the commonly used lichen species Rhizocarpon geographicum is longer than previously assumed. For exploratory purposes, an alternative lichen species (Porpidia soredizodes) has been tested for lichenometric dating, estimating a tentative growth rate of 0.737 mm yr−1.","","article","","664","","","A multi-proxy approach to Late Holocene fluctuations of Tungnahryggsjökull glaciers in the Tröllaskagi peninsula (northern Iceland)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719304152","0048-9697","2019","499-517","Science of The Total Environment"

The feed rate of lubricant, which is injected into the engine, is strictly related to neutralization reaction of sulphuric acid. At the state of the art, its amount is established following a function of engine load and sulphur content of fuel oil, but regardless the stoichiometric quantity needed to neutralize acid corrosion effects. As result of this lubrication strategy, feed rate of lubricant often results higher than the minimum stoichiometric quantity, yielding unnecessary costs, but sometimes feed rate of lubricant and its content of CaCO3 cannot be enough to completely neutralize sulphuric acid, producing corrosion. Taking into account that concentration of CaCO3 within lube oil can be estimated by measuring refractive index, this work aimed to study SPR sensors, capable to measure in real time small variation of lubricant optical properties, in order to adjust lubricant feed rate, according to the real needs of neutralization. Therefore, a numerical optimization of SPR sensors for lube oil characterization has been carried out, analysing several cases, different for laser source, optical prism and thickness of 3 metal film layers. Mathematical results allowed to find the best sensor in terms of sensitivity.

Thus, hydro-climatic states can be “sustained” through land-surface heat and water vapor fluxes primarily because they can “feed off” on this long-term soil moisture memory. Root-zone soil moisture memory is only but one feature characterizing the spectrum of soil moisture dynamics, which is analyzed here using a combination of long-term measurements and models. In particular, the spectrum of root-zone soil moisture content in a Mediterranean ecosystem is examined using 14-years of half-hourly measurements. A distinguishing hydro-climatic feature in such ecosystems is that sources (mainly rainfall) and sinks (mainly evapotranspiration) of soil moisture are roughly out of phase with each other. For over 4 decades of time scales and 7 decades of energy, the canonical shape of the measured soil moisture spectrum is shown to be approximately Lorentzian determined by the soil moisture variance and its memory but with two exceptions: the occurrences of a peak at diurnal-to-daily time scales and a weaker peak at near annual time scales. Model calculations and spectral analysis demonstrate that diurnal and seasonal variations in hydroclimate forcing responsible for variability in evapotranspiration had minor impact on the normalized shape of the soil moisture spectrum. However, their impact was captured by adjustments in the temporal variance. These findings indicate that precipitation and not evapotranspiration variability dominates the multi-scaling properties of soil moisture variability consistent with prior climate model simulations. Furthermore, the soil moisture memory inferred by the annual peak of soil moisture (340 d) is consistent with climate model simulations, while the memory evaluated from the loss function of a linearized mass balance approach leads to a smaller value (50 d), highlighting the effect of weak non-stationarity on soil moisture variability.","","article","","609","","","The root-zone soil moisture spectrum in a mediterranean ecosystem","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169422003328","0022-1694","2022","127757","Journal of Hydrology"

Vertical distribution of the organotin residues with depth throughout the core, with data on organochlorine compounds and heavy metals allowed for the construction of a consistent hypothesis on historical deposition of contaminated sediments. From this it was possible to infer that the concentrations of tributyltin in sediments deposited during the early 1960s were in the order of 400–600μg/g by using degradation rate constants derived by other workers.

The necessity of establishing sustainable road freight transportation plans have emerged for businesses. Therefore, it is important to develop decision support models that can be used by managers for sustainable road freight transportation. The objective of study is to predict the profit margin given to customers for freight trucking in sustainable road transportation. For this purpose, the variables affecting the profit margin to be given to the customers in sustainable road freight transportation are determined in the light of experts and managers. A data framework has been created using three-dimensional sustainability factors and customer-based variables. A machine learning-based methodology is developed. The scenario-based empirical investigation has been performed. Two different streams have been developed. The first stream is based on traditional importance analysis and second stream considers Recency, Frequency and Monetary based feature engineering and Discrete Wavelet Transform for noise reduction. Three different machine learning algorithms which are Random Forest, Robust Regression and XGBoost used for these two streams. Six different scenarios are considered. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to two sustainable road freight transportation firms in Turkey. It is aimed to achieve the best performance for profit margin prediction analysis along with demonstrating that the proposed approach provides higher evaluation accuracy. The benchmarking results revealed the superiority of the proposed approach, which trained and tested the prediction model using the stream of data coming from a combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform and feature extraction. The benchmarking and comparisons enact that enhanced XGBoost algorithms provides the best prediction result. This paper presents a novel approach to predict customer-based profit margin in sustainable road freight transportation sector by combining different machine-learning methods for the first time. This study also provides useful insights about strategic and sustainable development perspectives to managers.","","article","","314","","","Profit margin prediction in sustainable road freight transportation using machine learning","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621022083","0959-6526","2021","127990","Journal of Cleaner Production"

The deep sea is the largest ecosystem on the planet, the least accessible, and perhaps the least understood. Nevertheless, deep-sea data collected over the last few decades are now being synthesised with a view to both measuring global change and predicting the future impacts of further rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. For many years, it was assumed by many that the deep sea is a stable habitat, buffered from short-term changes in the atmosphere or upper ocean. However, recent studies suggest that deep-seafloor ecosystems may respond relatively quickly to seasonal, inter-annual and decadal-scale shifts in upper-ocean variables. In this review, we assess the evidence for these long-term (i.e. inter-annual to decadal-scale) changes both in biologically driven, sedimented, deep-sea ecosystems (e.g. abyssal plains) and in chemosynthetic ecosystems that are partially geologically driven, such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. We have identified 11 deep-sea sedimented ecosystems for which published analyses of long-term biological data exist. At three of these, we have found evidence for a progressive trend that could be potentially linked to recent climate change, although the evidence is not conclusive. At the other sites, we have concluded that the changes were either not significant, or were stochastically variable without being clearly linked to climate change or climate variability indices. For chemosynthetic ecosystems, we have identified 14 sites for which there are some published long-term data. Data for temporal changes at chemosynthetic ecosystems are scarce, with few sites being subjected to repeated visits. However, the limited evidence from hydrothermal vents suggests that at fast-spreading centres such as the East Pacific Rise, vent communities are impacted on decadal scales by stochastic events such as volcanic eruptions, with associated fauna showing complex patterns of community succession. For the slow-spreading centres such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, vent sites appear to be stable over the time periods measured, with no discernable long-term trend. At cold seeps, inferences based on spatial studies in the Gulf of Mexico, and data on organism longevity, suggest that these sites are stable over many hundreds of years. However, at the Haakon Mosby mud volcano, a large, well-studied seep in the Barents Sea, periodic mud slides associated with gas and fluid venting may disrupt benthic communities, leading to successional sequences over time. For chemosynthetic ecosystems of biogenic origin (e.g. whale-falls), it is likely that the longevity of the habitat depends mainly on the size of the carcass and the ecological setting, with large remains persisting as a distinct seafloor habitat for up to 100 years. Studies of shallow-water analogs of deep-sea ecosystems such as marine caves may also yield insights into temporal processes. Although it is obvious from the geological record that past climate change has impacted deep-sea faunas, the evidence that recent climate change or climate variability has altered deep-sea benthic communities is extremely limited. This mainly reflects the lack of remote sensing of this vast seafloor habitat. Current and future advances in deep-ocean benthic science involve new remote observing technologies that combine a high temporal resolution (e.g. cabled observatories) with spatial capabilities (e.g. autonomous vehicles undertaking image surveys of the seabed).","","incollection","Academic Press","58","","","Chapter One - Temporal Change in Deep-Sea Benthic Ecosystems: A Review of the Evidence From Recent Time-Series Studies","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123810151000010","0065-2881","2010","1-95",""

Henry","","","","AMS, magnetic susceptibility, anisotropy, petrofabrics, tectonic deformation, tectonic stress, crystal or grain alignment","","1","","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0012-8252(96)00044-X","Anisotropy of low field magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a versatile petrofabric tool. For magnetite, AMS primarily defines grain-shape anisotropy; for other minerals, AMS expresses crystallographic control on magnetic properties. Thus, we may infer the orientation-distribution of a dominant mineral from the AMS of a rock. AMS principal directions can record current directions from sediment, flow-directions from magma, finite-strain directions from tectonized rocks and stress-directions from low-strain, low-temperature, neotectonic environments. AMS measurements may reveal some aspects of the strain-path, where carefully selected. For example, we may compare different parts of a heterogeneously strained domain, different minerals in a homogeneously strained site, AMS with schistosity/mineral lineation, and AMS with remanence-anisotropy. Such measurements isolate the orientation-distributions of different minerals, adding a temporal scale to the kinematic sequence. Normally, we can interpret the principal directions of AMS distributions as a physically significant direction, such as a current direction, magmatic flow or finite-strain axis. However, calibrating the AMS ellipsoid shape against the magnitude of the controlling physical process is very difficult. Primarily, this is because the shape of the AMS ellipsoid combines contributions from several minerals whose individual AMS ellipsoids are of different shape. Thus, small variations in the proportions of minerals change the shape of the rock's AMS ellipsoid, even if the alignment process were of constant intensity. In deformed rocks, AMS is more strain-sensitive than calcite twinning or the alignment of calcite or quartz c-axes. Not all AMS fabrics relate to crystallographic or grain alignment. First, displacement fabrics generate AMS where an isotropic matrix of high susceptibility displaces unevenly spaced objects of low susceptibility and suitable scales. Second, AMS location fabrics occur where sub-isometric magnetite grains are close enough, in certain directions, for their demagnetizing fields to interact. This accounts for the AMS of many magnetite-dominated signals where there is no aligned magnetite. Third, the AMS of single-domain magnetite is inverse to shape so that such grains may oppose the AMS contribution of parallel minerals. Finally, transitional sedimentary-tectonic or magmatic-tectonic fabrics yield smeared, temporal sequences of AMS principal directions that cannot be immediately attributed to a single alignment process. These transitional AMS ellipsoids mix primary and secondary AMS components, making it difficult to characterize either component. However, such fabric combinations may permit us to recognize the sense of shearing in flow processes.","","article","","42","","","Tectonic applications of magnetic susceptibility and its anisotropy","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282529600044X","0012-8252","1997","49-93","Earth-Science Reviews"

Because of the heavy load of contaminated dusts in the air of the overcrowded cities, the ambient concentrations of toxic metals are now among the highest being reported anywhere. Lead pollution from the increasing number of automobiles and cottage industries represents a major health hazard, and it is estimated that 15–30% of the infants in some urban areas may already be suffering from lead poisoning. The cultural and lifestyle determinants of lead exposure and the greater susceptibility of African populations to environmental metal poisoning are highlighted. The suggestion is made that the environmental health criteria for toxic metals in the developed countries may not provide adequate protection for many African communities.","","article","","121","","","Toxic metal pollution in Africa","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004896979290304B","0048-9697","1992","1-37","Science of The Total Environment"

The Romans developed a rather advanced appreciation of concrete technology, including the use of pozzolanas, experimentation with concrete reinforced using bronze bars and the introduction of lightweight and even air-entrained concrete. The stones and sand, or ‘aggregates’, were only included as bulking materials, but the writings of Vitruvius in De Architectura demonstrate that the Romans recognised the influence of rock types and particle size distribution on the selection of aggregates for good-quality concrete and mortars. In more recent times, it has become increasingly understood that the properties of aggregates can have an important bearing on the properties and durability of the concrete in which they are used, so that today the requirements for successful aggregates are closely specified and controlled. Concrete is the major structural engineering material of modern times and aggregates comprise around three-quarters by volume of concrete, so that the importance of the quality of those aggregates can hardly be overstated.","","incollection","Butterworth-Heinemann","","Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete (Fifth Edition)","978-0-08-100773-0","15 - Concrete Aggregates","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081007730000150","","2019","699-778",""

However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.","","article","","544","","","The structure and dynamics of multilayer networks","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157314002105","0370-1573","2014","1-122","Physics Reports"

In this section we focus on plasma density irregularities at scale lengths of λ > 10km, which are typically referred as “large-scale” irregularities. But they actually include mesoscale and small-scale density structures usually defined in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T) system (see Section 1.2). We will examine two categories of irregularities: plasma density enhancements and depletions, discuss how they contribute to space weather, and their role in cross-scale coupling in the M-I-T system. Section 3.2 In this part of the chapter, we discuss the state-of-the-art models to investigate different ionospheric fluid instabilities in the F region and their effect on satellite navigation signals. We also elucidate the linear and nonlinear evolution of some of the typical instabilities with examples and their observational signatures. We discuss remote sensing of the instabilities to simulate observable effects on the ground. Finally, we leave the reader with potential topics of research in this fairly old, yet vastly unresolved area of research. Section 3.3 The midlatitude ionosphere, as an interface between low- and high-latitude processes, is a region that exhibits far more dynamics than might be otherwise anticipated. One example is the presence of substantial electron density gradients. These include SED and the main ionospheric trough. These structures are characteristic storm-time features which are developed in the mid- and subauroral ionosphere as an integrate component of the geospace systems and affect high-latitude ionospheric structures such as the tongue of ionization (TOI) and polar cap patches via dynamic transport, and possibly contribute to magnetospheric processes through ion upflow and outflow.","","incollection","Elsevier","","Cross-Scale Coupling and Energy Transfer in the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere System","978-0-12-821366-7","Chapter 3 - Density, irregularity, and instability","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128213667000019","","2022","103-216",""

The approaches of the leadership behavior, context of the environment, technical and social skills, characteristics, risks of human errors, and respective analysis of decisions making are discussed case by case. High prominence is given in the approaches and results of leadership and of team procedures under the different situations of human reliability analysis, referring to shared experiences that can intervene positively or negatively on the company's results, both in the routine activities or in emergency situations. Listening and analyzing the operator's discourse as a link for the exchange of knowledge and commitment are essential in this text. Also, possible human errors at the levels of management, execution, strategic, and emergency are discussed, including the impacts generated by non-assertive decisions. In each case, learning points can be observed for composition of diagnoses and training, including concerns related to human and sociotechnical reliability. These points are derived from practical factory floor experiences, which include production, maintenance, technology, management, and research activities. Discussions are presented of the cases investigated and demanded by society and transformed into articles or services, dealing with cognitive academy, archetype, executive function, and operator’s discourse to the chemical industry, guilt culture, operational control, and just culture. The investigations contained in the articles present validation of the guidelines and reaffirm tools. In this context, demands from companies and society are presented which, due to lack of understanding about human factors, are a necessity for the practice of effective safety culture, through complex processes-tasks-social relations, in facing unexpected accidents, until the possible flight of the Black Swans.","","incollection","Elsevier","","Human Factor and Reliability Analysis to Prevent Losses in Industrial Processes","978-0-12-819650-2","Chapter 5 - Learned lessons: human factor assessment in task","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012819650200002X","","2022","213-306",""

"WAYNE19911","R.P Wayne and I Barnes and P Biggs and J.P Burrows and C.E Canosa-Mas and J Hjorth and G ","The nitrate radical: Physics, Chemistry, and the Atmosphere","","","","","1","","https://doi.org/10.1016/0960-1686(91)90192-A","This review surveys the present state of knowledge of the nitrate (NO3 radical. Laboratory data on the physics and chemistry of the radical and atmospheric determination of the concentrations of the radical are both considered. One aim of the review is to highlight the relationship between the laboratory and the atmospheric studies. Although the emphasis of the review is on gas-phase processes, relevant studies conducted in condensed phases are mentioned because of their potential importance in the interpretation of cloud and aerosol chemistry. The spectroscopy, structure, and photochemistry of the radical are examined. Here, the object is to establich the spectroscopic basis for detection of the radical and measurement of its concentration in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Infrared, visible, and paramagnetic resonance spectra are considered. An important quantity discussed is the absorption cross section in the visible region, which is required for quantitative measurements. Interpretation of the spectroscopic features requires an understanding of the geometrical and electronic structure of the radical in its ground and excited states; there is still some controversy about the groundstate geometry, but the most recent experimental evidence 9eg from laser induced fluorescence) and theoretical calculations suggest that the radical has D3h symmetry. Photodissociation of the radical is important in the atmosphere, and the product channels, quantum yields, and dissociation dynamics are discussed. A short examination of the thermodynamics (heat and entropy of formation) of the radical is presented. The main exposition of laboratory studies of the chemistry of the nitrate radical is preceded by a consideration of the techniques used for kinetic and mechanistic studies. Methods for the generation and detection of the radical and the kinetic tools employed are all presented. The exact nature of the technique used in individual studies has some relevance to the way in which data must be analysed, and to the type of mechanistic information that can be extracted. Continuous and stopped flow, flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis, molecular modulation, and static reactor techniques can all provide absolute kinetic data, while relative rate measurements have been a further rich source of information. The treatment of the chemical reactions of the nitrate radical is formally divided into the interactions with non-radical inorganic (deemed to include NO and NO2) and organic species, and with atoms and free radicals. In general, the reactions with open-shell species are much more rapid than those with closed-shell reactants. With the closed-shell partners, addition reactions are faster than abstraction reactions. An attempt is made to consider critically the published data on most reactions of importance, and to tabulate rate constants and temperature dependences where possible. However, it is not the objective of this review to provide recommendations for rate parameters. Evidence for the products of the reactions is sought, and for the branching ratios into the various channels where more than one exists. One theme of this part of the review is the elucidation of correlations of reactivity with structure and with the reactions of other radical species such as OH. The review turns next to a consideration of the role of NO3 in the atmosphere, of its atmospheric sources and sinks, and of field measurements of concentrations of the radical. Long-path visible-absorption spectroscopy and matrix-isolation ESR have both been used successfully in field measurements in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere. Balloon-borne instruments and ground-based remote sensing have been used to obtain stratospheric concentrations. Two of the most important implications of the measurements are that the stratospheric profiles are consistent with accepted chemistry (and, in particular, do not require the postulation of an unidentified scavenging mechanism that had, at one stage, been proposed), and that the highly variable night-time tropospheric concentrations imply that NO3 is a reactive tropospheric constituent. The inter-relation between laboratory studies and atmospheric observations, and the problems in extrapolating laboratory data to atmospheric conditions, are both explored. Initiation of night-time chemical transformations by NO3 and the possible production of OH are considered. The available information is then brought together to see how far NO3 is a sensitive indicator of the state of the atmosphere, and some speculations are presented about the involvement of NO3 (or N2O5) in damage to trees and plants. The final section of the review suggests some issues that remain unresolved concerning the NO3 radical which is directly or indirectly relevant to a better knowledge of the part played by the radical in the atmosphere. Amongst the requirements noted are improved data for the heat of formation of the radical, its absorption cross section in the visible region (and, especially, the temperature dependence of the cross section), and the details of its photochemistry. There is also still a need for a definitive determination of the equilibrium constant and its temperature dependence for the association with NO2 and the reverse dissociation of N2O5. A series of chemical reactions deserves further investigation, especially with regard to elucidation of product channels, and overall oxidation mechanisms also need to be defined better. Future atmospheric studies that are desirable include study of basic NO3 chemistry in the field to understand the influence of humidity on the conversion (probably on surfaces) of N2O5 to HNO3, and thus on NO3 concentrations. In addition, a study of the chemistry of NO3 in the presence of volatile organic compounds and at elevated concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen should help in the understanding of, for example, polluted marine coasts, forests, and urban areas.","","article","","25","","","The nitrate radical: Physics, chemistry, and the atmosphere","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096016869190192A","0960-1686","1991","1-203","Atmospheric Environment.

Air quality has manifold effects on health, ecosystems, heritage and climate. In this review the state of scientific understanding in relation to global and regional air quality is outlined. The review discusses air quality, in terms of emissions, processing and transport of trace gases and aerosols. New insights into the characterization of both natural and anthropogenic emissions are reviewed looking at both natural (e.g. dust and lightning) as well as plant emissions. Trends in anthropogenic emissions both by region and globally are discussed as well as biomass burning emissions. In terms of chemical processing the major air quality elements of ozone, non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and aerosols are covered. A number of topics are presented as a way of integrating the process view into the atmospheric context; these include the atmospheric oxidation efficiency, halogen and HOx chemistry, nighttime chemistry, tropical chemistry, heat waves, megacities, biomass burning and the regional hot spot of the Mediterranean. New findings with respect to the transport of pollutants across the scales are discussed, in particular the move to quantify the impact of long-range transport on regional air quality. Gaps and research questions that remain intractable are identified. The review concludes with a focus of research and policy questions for the coming decade. In particular, the policy challenges for concerted air quality and climate change policy (co-benefit) are discussed.","","article","","43","","","Atmospheric composition change – global and regional air quality","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231009007109","1352-2310","2009","5268-5350","Atmospheric Environment"

However, the increasing importance of human fascioliasis worldwide has re‐launched interest in fascioliasis. From the 1990s, many new concepts have been developed regarding human fascioliasis and these have furnished a new baseline for the human disease that is very different to a simple extrapolation from fascioliasis in livestock. Studies have shown that human fascioliasis presents marked heterogeneity, including different epidemiological situations and transmission patterns in different endemic areas. This heterogeneity, added to the present emergence/re‐emergence of the disease both in humans and animals in many regions, confirms a worrying global scenario. The huge negative impact of fascioliasis on human communities demands rapid action. When analyzing how better to define control measures for endemic areas differing at such a level, it would be useful to have genetic markers that could distinguish each type of transmission pattern and epidemiological situation. Accordingly, this chapter covers aspects of aetiology, geographical distribution, epidemiology, transmission and control in order to obtain a solid baseline for the interpretation of future results. The origins and geographical spread of F. hepatica and F. gigantica in both the ruminant pre‐domestication times and the livestock post‐domestication period are analyzed. Paleontological, archaeological and historical records, as well as genetic data on recent dispersal of livestock species, are taken into account to establish an evolutionary framework for the two fasciolids across all continents. Emphasis is given to the distributional overlap of both species and the roles of transportation, transhumance and trade in the different overlap situations. Areas with only one Fasciola spp. are distinguished from local and zonal overlaps in areas where both fasciolids co‐exist. Genetic techniques applied to liver flukes in recent years that are useful to elucidate the genetic characteristics of the two fasciolids are reviewed. The intra‐specific and inter‐specific variabilities of ‘pure’ F. hepatica and ‘pure’ F. gigantica were ascertained by means of complete sequences of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS)‐2 and ITS‐1 and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) cox1 and nad1 from areas with only one fasciolid species. Fasciolid sequences of the same markers scattered in the literature are reviewed. The definitive haplotypes established appear to fit the proposed global evolutionary scenario. Problems posed by fasciolid cross‐breeding, introgression and hybridization in overlap areas are analyzed. Nuclear rDNA appears to correlate with adult fluke characteristics and fasciolid/lymnaeid specificity, whereas mtDNA does not. However, flukes sometimes appear so intermediate that they cannot be ascribed to either F. hepatica‐like or F. gigantica‐like forms and snail specificity may be opposite to the one deduced from the adult morphotype. The phenotypic characteristics of adults and eggs of ‘pure’ F. hepatica and F. gigantica, as well as of intermediate forms in overlap areas, are compared, with emphasis on the definitive host influence on egg size in humans. Knowledge is sufficient to support F. hepatica and F. gigantica as two valid species, which recently diverged by adaptation to different pecoran and lymnaeid hosts in areas with differing environmental characteristics. Their phenotypic differences and ancient pre‐domestication origins involve a broad geographical area that largely exceeds the typical, more local scenarios known for sub‐species units. Phenomena such as abnormal ploidy and aspermic parthenogenesis in hybrids suggest that their separate evolution in pre‐domestication times allowed them to achieve almost total genetic isolation. Recent sequencing results suggest that present assumptions on fasciolid‐lymnaeid specificity might be wrong. The crucial role of lymnaeids in fascioliasis transmission, epidemiology and control was the reason for launching a worldwide lymnaeid molecular characterization initiative. This initiative has already furnished useful results on several continents. A standardized methodology for fasciolids and lymnaeids is proposed herein in order that future work is undertaken on a comparable basis. A complete understanding of molecular epidemiology is expected to help greatly in designing global actions and local interventions for control of fascioliasis.","","incollection","Academic Press","69","","","Chapter 2 Fasciola, Lymnaeids and Human Fascioliasis, with a Global Overview on Disease Transmission, Epidemiology, Evolutionary Genetics, Molecular Epidemiology and Control","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065308X09690023","0065-308X","2009","41-146",""

Hydrosol particles (aerosol particles that have been transferred into water droplets) nucleate ice through freezing. A small without scavenging or being scavenged by another aerosol particle. It is also difficult to imagine that pure mineral particles can be lifted from soil surfaces. In view of this, an ice-nucleating site may be a much smaller particle attached to a larger clay particle. To this category belong, e.g., silver iodide-clay mixed particles. Limited studies indicate that decaying leaves and forest litter under the surface of soils are a potential source of biogenic ice-forming nuclei but that their contribution to the atmosphere is very limited. Research should be directed to study possible relations between cloud condensation nuclei and ice-forming nuclei derived from natural organic compounds (terpenes, leaf-derived nuclei, bacteria, etc.). A balance must be maintained between large cloud chambers, in which duplication of in-cloud processes is possible, and the special instrumentation which provides information about the modes of ice nucleation on aerosol particles. The two modes of instrumentation should supplement each other. The greatest difficulty in attempting to make a comparison between the number of ice-forming nuclei estimated in the laboratory and the number in a cloud is the lack of knowledge of the time-temperature-humidity history of the aerosol particles. In nature, the ability of an aerosol particle to nucleate ice may be destroyed or“poisoned“ in the presence of pollutants. An aerosol particle may, on the other hand, become an activated or warmer ice-forming nucleus, e.g.,after the sublimation of ice once formed on it. The temperature of ice nucleation is not a singular property of a particle; the warmest temperatures of ice nucleation of, e.g., particles of a certain soil 10cm in diameter are-15°C,-10°C, and-8°C for nucleation through freezing, condensation followed by freezing and contact, respectively (ref.26). The progress made in instrumentation permits studies of the modes of ice nucleation. Understanding the physical and chemical processes taking place in clouds makes estimates of the rates of ice particle formation more realistic (Young [ref.157]). The reader should examine two previous reviews written by Mossop (1963) and Montefinale . (1971) for a more complete list of references.","","article","","10","","","The role of natural and man-made ice-forming nuclei in the atmosphere","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001868679870104","0001-8686","1979","315-367","Advances in Colloid and Interface Science"

Using this formula, hazards are compared and ranked, allowing disaster managers to determine the most effective and appropriate treatment options. The goal of risk analysis is a standard measurement of likelihood and consequence, whether quantitative or qualitative. Consequence describes hazard effects on humans, built structures, and the environment. Losses may be direct or indirect, and tangible or intangible. Hazard likelihood and consequences can change considerably over time. These trends can be incremental or extreme and can occur suddenly or over centuries. Risk evaluation is conducted to determine the relative seriousness of risks, and to compare and prioritize them. Disaster managers must decide what risks to treat, what risks to prevent at all costs, and what risks to disregard. These decisions are based on risk acceptability. The personal factors that dictate risk acceptability are guided by risk perception. Vulnerability is a measure of the propensity of an object, area, individual, group, community, country, or other entity to incur the consequences of a hazard, and is the result of physical, social, economic, and environmental factors.","","incollection","Butterworth-Heinemann","","Introduction to International Disaster Management (Fourth Edition)","978-0-12-817368-8","Chapter 3 - Risk and vulnerability","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128173688000038","","2020","177-265",""

The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most tragic epidemiologic events since the swine flu in 1917–18 and HIV/AIDS beginning in 1981, both of which killed tens of millions globally. Since the 1870s, life expectancy in industrialized countries has increased steadily, and life expectancy in developing countries has risen dramatically since the 1920s. The spread of public health and medical sciences greatly reduced the massive number of killing and crippling diseases, such as smallpox, malaria, measles, polio, and tuberculosis. Public health has evolved, addressing and shaping an epidemiologic transition in which noncommunicable diseases have become the preeminent cause of illness and death. Since the 1960s, public health and clinical medicine have developed, in tandem, a new transition emphasizing health promotion. This transition has seen dramatic success in improving life expectancy through prevention modalities, including early diagnosis and treatment. The 21st century has seen global health advance through networks of public–private and academic health organizations that have promoted crucial initiatives to expand public health to low- and middle-income countries to improve sanitation, reduce poverty, reduce maternal and child mortality, and control infectious diseases via the Millennium Development Goals to 2015, with commendable participation and success. Those goals were followed by the expanded Sustainable Development Goals to 2030. The first decades of the 21st century have witnessed a series of coronavirus and influenza pandemics. The deadly COVID-19 pandemic has cast a pall over global health, with hundreds of millions of cases, millions of deaths, and a stream of viral variants that have swamped control measures. But the future of global health is ripe with positive developments, such as developing new vaccines for Ebola, malaria, and the COVID-19 virus. The evolving New Public Health faces old and new diseases, the challenges of poverty, and the inequities discussed in previous chapters. Global health will need expanded public–private cooperative health networks and initiatives to build on successes and learn from setbacks, including looming climate change, persistent social and health inequity, new global health challenges, and follow-up on many recent achievements.","San Diego","incollection","Academic Press","","The New Public Health (Fourth Edition)","978-0-12-822957-6","Chapter 16 - Global health","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128229576000028","","2023","1097-1158",""

Echinococcus multilocularis (causative agent of AE) is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere where it is typically maintained in a wild animal cycle including canids as definitive hosts and rodents as intermediate hosts. The species Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus ortleppi, Echinococcus canadensis and Echinococcus intermedius are the causative agents of CE with a worldwide distribution and a highly variable human disease burden in the different endemic areas depending upon human behavioural risk factors, the diversity and ecology of animal host assemblages and the genetic diversity within Echinococcus species which differ in their zoonotic potential and pathogenicity. Both AE and CE are regarded as neglected zoonoses, with a higher overall burden of disease for CE due to its global distribution and high regional prevalence, but a higher pathogenicity and case fatality rate for AE, especially in Asia. Over the past two decades, numerous studies have addressed the epidemiology and distribution of these Echinococcus species worldwide, resulting in better-defined boundaries of the endemic areas.

Despite the short time-depth of human presence in the country there is ongoing debate about the date of earliest arrival of people that resulted in the emergence of two contrasting colonisation hypotheses: the Early hypothesis and the Short prehistory. To decide between both hypotheses we employed a range of multi-proxy investigations (geochemistry, stable isotopes and mineral magnetism) on a lacustrine sequence from Lake Pupuke, a maar lake in the city of Auckland and an area potentially among the first places in New Zealand to have been colonised by early people. The environmental history reconstructed from the multi-proxy evidence identified a clear lack of catchment disturbance from c. 2000B.P. until several decades before the eruption of the Rangitoto volcano. The nature and abruptness of disturbance unambiguously point to anthropogenic forcings and are likely to mark the onset of prehistoric human colonisation at the site. Linear interpolation between independently dated tephrochronostratigraphic marker beds present in the sediments allowed to date this event to c. 610calyrB.P. This date is in compliance with the Short prehistory for this region.","","article","","202","","","Multi-proxy evidence of late Holocene human-induced environmental changes at Lake Pupuke, Auckland (New Zealand)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618209000445","1040-6182","2009","69-93","Quaternary International"

As numerous small satellites were launched in recent years, millions of AIS messages are captured by these satellite AIS providers every day. The massive amount of data allow shipping firms and port operators to better predict vessels’ movement. In this study, a computational framework is developed to predict future trajectories and destinations of vessels by applying deep learning to the satellite AIS messages containing self-reporting positioning data. We employed deep learning approaches for large-scale maritime prediction and identifies the most suitable deep neural networks for this specific application. Three prediction models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Dense Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been tested in the framework. A multi-task learning architecture is implemented based on test results. Through sharing parameters while training, this architecture enables long-term destination predictions by balancing short-term trajectory predictions. The framework is validated globally with the experiments covering five large-scale sea areas. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM model with an average accuracy percentage of 85.1% outperforms the CNN and DNN with accuracy percentages of 68.3% and 78.2% respectively. The LSTM model with multi-task architecture can achieve an accuracy of 87.0%.

The detection performance is often hindered by adjacent pipeline, near-field ferromagnetic objects and random noises. In order to overcome these obstacles, a magnetic anomaly detection method based on deep learning neural networks (DLNN) is proposed to decouple and denoise the integrated detection to accurately extract the magnetic anomaly of single pipeline. The theoretical derivation of the vertical component of magnetic anomaly was executed based on Poisson's equation. Then the integrated detection was simulated by summing magnetic anomalies of parallel pipelines and metal sphere, as well as white Gaussian noise. The DLNN was constructed with improved optimization design, and trained using supervised learning method. The results show that the proposed method exhibits almost immune to random noises, the prediction accuracy approaches to 90% with signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB. Meanwhile, the predictive accuracy is still above 80% with interferences both from near-field ferromagnetic objects and random noises with SNR of 30 dB.

However, as maritime environments can be quite complex, developing object detection models that can handle these situations is a challenging research problem, particularly when dealing with adverse weather conditions like rain and haze. While prior research has attempted to remove weather noise and improve object detection models under various weather conditions, they are limited by computing resources and hard to adapt to the constantly changing weather conditions of maritime environments. Preventing performance degradation as weather conditions shift is a significant challenge in maritime surveillance systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a weather-aware object detection method, Weather-OD, that employs an on-board edge and on-shore cloud-based system for maritime surveillance. It employs specialized machine learning models for object detection, which can be dynamically selected based on the weather conditions to ensure highly accurate object detection with low latency at sea. Weather-OD continuously improves accuracy by periodically training the models with newly collected datasets during voyages, and efficiently manages the life cycle of multiple object detection models, taking into account the constraints of limited edge computing resources. In addition, Weather-OD uses synthetic image data with weather noise to supplement the training data under different weather conditions. We conducted an evaluation of our weather-aware object detection models using a maritime benchmark dataset, the Singapore Maritime Dataset. Our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of our mechanism with weather classification and a significant improvement in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of maritime object detection in rainy and hazy conditions. Additionally, our approach enables the continuous improvement of object detection accuracy through model retraining with small datasets.","","article","","","","","Weather-aware object detection method for maritime surveillance systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X2300362X","0167-739X","2023","","Future Generation Computer Systems"

Classical outlier detection schemes typically rely on the assumption that normal/background data of interest are distributed according to an assumed statistical model and search for data that deviate from that assumption. However, it is frequently the case that performance is reduced because the underlying distribution does not follow the assumed model. Manifold learning techniques offer improved performance by learning better models of the background but can be too computationally expensive due to the need to calculate a distance measure between all data points. Here, we study a general framework that allows manifold learning techniques to be used for unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing computational expense via a uniform random sampling of a small fraction of the data. A background manifold is learned from the sample and then an out-of-sample extension is used to project unsampled data into the learned manifold space and construct an anomaly detection statistic based on the prediction error of the learned manifold. The method works well for unsupervised anomaly detection because, by definition, the ratio of anomalous to non-anomalous data points is small and the sampling will be dominated by background points. However, a variety of parameters that affect detection performance are introduced so we use here a low-dimensional toy problem to investigate their effect on the performance of four learning algorithms (kernel PCA, two versions of diffusion map, and the Parzen density estimator). We then apply the methods to the detection of watercraft in an ensemble of 22 infrared maritime scenes where we find kernel PCA to be superior and show that it outperforms a commonly employed baseline algorithm. The framework is not limited to the tested image processing example and can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection task.","","article","","91","","","Manifold learning techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417305328","0957-4174","2018","374-385","Expert Systems with Applications"

For the elderly, living alone can be difficult and dangerous. Consequently, smart homes are becoming increasingly popular. A sensor-rich environment can be exploited for healthcare applications, in particular, anomaly detection (AD). The literature review for this paper showed that few works consider environmental factors to detect anomalies. Instead, the focus is on user activity and checking whether it is abnormal, i.e., does not conform to expected behavior. Furthermore, reducing the number of anomalies using early detection is a major issue in many applications. In this context, anomaly-cause discovery may be helpful in recommending actions that may prevent risk. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the risk of anomalies occurring in the environment regarding user activities. The method relies on anomaly-cause extraction from a given dataset using causal association rules mining. These anomaly causes are utilized afterward for real-time analysis to detect the risk of anomalies using the Markov logic network machine learning method. The detected risk allows the method to recommend suitable actions to perform in order to avoid the occurrence of an actual anomaly. The proposed approach is implemented, tested, and evaluated for each contribution using real data obtained from an intelligent environment platform and real data from a clinical datasets. Experimental results prove our approach to be efficient in terms of recognition rate.","","article","","91","","","Early anomaly detection in smart home: A causal association rule-based approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365717305985","0933-3657","2018","57-71","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine"

First, the categories of abnormal ship behavior and data sources of DASB are concretely introduced, and the process of data-driven DASB combined with expert knowledge are described. Second, we conduct systematic disciplinary knowledge maps in the field of DASB, which identify evolution, hotspots and emerging trends. In this manner, data-driven methods for DASB were categorized into six types, including multisource data fusion approaches, statistical analysis approaches, traditional intelligent algorithmic approaches, deep learning approaches, knowledge-based and data-driven integrating approaches and computing power, and provide an overview of them.

For maritime awareness, coastal surveillance, and maritime activities in the Region of Interest (ROI) should be monitored. One of the ways to keep this in check is to restrain unwanted infiltration. Monitoring unwanted infiltration is feasible through vessel trajectory forecasting and anomaly detection in real time. Most solutions for trajectory predictions are available but require a huge amount of historical data, and high-power computing resources. Here, the requirement is developing a decision support framework consisting of both lite weight approaches for short-term predictions and deep learning-based techniques for long-term forecasting. This paper aims to find the suitability of Linear Stationary Models (LSM) like the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting and forecasting the Vessel Trajectory as means of lite weight short-term predictions. For this purpose, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset of the U.S. West Coast is used. The significant effort was for data pre-processing to create a robust dataset for model training. An appropriate model after the model-selection process is used for trajectory forecasting. The model's accuracy is validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance indices for residual and forecast errors. A window generator model is integrated with the best-fitted ARIMA model for recursive real-time predictions, with varied sizes and visualization. The proposed time-series model provided a very high accuracy as the RMSE value for prediction and 48 hours forecast are 0.023 and 0.017, respectively.","","article","","218","","","Framework for Ship Trajectory Forecasting Based on Linear Stationary Models Using Automatic Identification System","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923001254","1877-0509","2023","1463-1474","Procedia Computer Science"

In the new methodology, the topological and evolutionary characteristics of ship traffic networks and the uncertainty in ship movements are considered simultaneously to realise probabilistic collision detection. The methodology, through the effective integration of probabilistic conflict estimation and traffic complexity modelling and assessment, enables the evaluation of traffic complexity in a fine-grained hierarchical manner.

The framework is suited for problems in which individual machine learning paradigms cannot be directly implemented: supervised learning is not applicable due to the lack of labelled data, unsupervised learning is not effective since the normal operations are insufficiently defined and take complex and diverse forms, and deep learning risks confusing problematic behaviours for expected ones due to the possible repetitiveness of similar anomalies. The proposed approach is comprised of two phases: unsupervised discovery of anomalies, and semi-supervised construction and tuning of the anomaly detection algorithm. By leveraging data exploration methods and expert knowledge, the resulting algorithms are interpretable and detect a wide range of anomalous behaviours. The approach is applied to the early detection of wear and tear of maritime propulsion and manoeuvring machinery.

The residuals between the observed and the reconstructed signals are analysed using standard Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT), where appropriate alarms are raised based on the sequential behaviour of the residuals. The modifications we introduce include: a novel cluster based method to select memory vectors to be considered by the AAKR, which gives an extensive reduction in computation time; a generalization of the distance measure, which makes it possible to distinguish between explanatory and response variables; and a regional credibility estimation used in the residuals analysis, to let the time used to identify if a sequence of query vectors represents an anomalous state or not, depend on the amount of data situated close to or surrounding the query vector.

The recent increase of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of receivers is making AIS one of the main sources of information for Maritime Situational Awareness activities. Nevertheless, AIS is subject to reliability and manipulation issues; indeed, the received reports can be unintentionally incorrect, jammed or deliberately spoofed. Moreover, the system can be switched off to cover illicit operations, causing the interruption of AIS reception. This paper addresses the problem of detecting whether a shortage of AIS messages represents an alerting situation or not, by exploiting the Received Signal Strength Indicator available at the AIS Base Stations (BS). In designing such an anomaly detector, the electromagnetic propagation conditions that characterize the channel between ship AIS transponders and BS have to be taken into consideration. The first part of this work is thus focused on the experimental investigation and characterisation of coverage patterns extracted from the real historical AIS data. In addition, the paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm to identify intentional AIS on-off switching.

This study proposes a framework for extracting maritime traffic network based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The framework consists of maritime traffic pattern recognition, semantic routes extraction, route decomposition, and network generation. Firstly, a data-driven method is introduced to recognize ship behavior patterns and extends the single ship behaviors to regional characteristics to determine the departure-arrival areas. Then, based on the different combination of departure-arrival areas, the ship trajectories are classified to traffic groups. Subsequently, the grid-system is used to rasterize each traffic group, which realizes the fusion of trajectory data and geographic location information. Finally, to obtain the main routes and navigation channels, the extraction method is introduced by establishing the cumulative grid importance function. The main routes, together with the navigation channels, compose the maritime traffic network. The method is applied to AIS data in the Beibu Gulf, and the results show that the traffic network contains 12 stop areas, 4 entry/exit locations, 13 main routes as well as their corresponding navigation channels. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method helps (1) provide a theoretical framework to obtain and analyze the maritime traffic network and (2) enrich navigation channel identification methods for maritime transport management.","","article","","239","","","A data mining method to extract traffic network for maritime transport management","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569123001473","0964-5691","2023","106622","Ocean & Coastal Management"

The adoption of e-Navigation is a possible solution for improving safety and security at sea by integrating maritime information on board and ashore. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data represents a fundamental source of information, since the analysis of AIS data can highlight the presence of congested areas as well as of illegal actions, such as smuggling, pollution, and unauthorized phishing in protected areas. Indeed, those activities are often characterized by abnormal manoeuvres that can be recognized by analyzing the routes of the vessels. However, the huge dimension of the AIS data to process requires the adoption of careful strategies for the data visualization.

This is facilitated via a system intelligence-based approach that can be subsequently utilized to provide enhanced situation awareness to navigators and future autonomous ships, aiding proactive collision avoidance. By evaluating the historical ship behavior in a given geographical region, the method applies machine learning techniques to extrapolate commonalities in relevant trajectory segments. These commonalities represent historical behavior modes that correspond to the possible future behavior of the selected vessel. Subsequently, the selected vessel is classified to a behavior mode, and a trajectory with respect to this mode is predicted. This is achieved via an initial clustering technique and subsequent trajectory extraction. The extracted trajectories are then compressed using the Karhunen–Loéve transform, and clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The approach in this study differs from others in that trajectories are not clustered for an entire region, but rather for relevant trajectory segments. As such, the extracted trajectories provide a much better basis for clustering relevant historical ship behavior modes. A selected vessel is then classified to one of these modes using its observed behavior. Trajectory predictions are facilitated using an enhanced subset of data that likely correspond to the future behavior of the selected vessel. The method yields promising results, with high classification accuracy and low prediction error. However, vessels with abnormal behavior degrade the results in some situations, and have also been discussed in this study.","","article","","7","","","Ship behavior prediction via trajectory extraction-based clustering for maritime situation awareness","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246801332100022X","2468-0133","2022","1-13","Journal of Ocean Engineering and Science"

During a PSC inspection, PSC officers (PSCOs) identify ship deficiencies that lead to a ship's detention, which can cause severe economic and reputational losses to the ship operator. Therefore, this study innovatively uses PSC inspection data to design ship maintenance plans for ship operators to minimize overall operational costs. We identify three types of operational costs associated with each deficiency code: inspection cost, repair cost, and risk cost in the ship operators’ decision-making process. The risk cost of a deficiency code is strongly related to the detention contribution of the deficiency items under a deficiency code, as indicated by the feature importance of that code in the random forest (RF) model used to predict detention outcomes. To design ship maintenance plans, the sequential predict-then-optimize (PO) method typically solves the optimization problem using input parameters, including the predicted probabilities of having deficiency items under each code and the three types of operational costs. However, the loss function in this two-stage framework does not consider the effect of predictions on the downstream decisions. Hence, we use a smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) method using an ensemble of SPO trees (SPOTs). Each SPOT uses an SPO loss function that measures the sub-optimality of the decisions derived from the predicted parameters. By exploiting the structural properties of the optimization problem analyzed in this study, we demonstrate that training an SPOT for this problem can be simplified tremendously by using the relative class frequency of true labels within a leaf node to yield a minimum SPO loss. Computational experiments show that the SPO-based ship maintenance scheme is superior to other schemes and can reduce a ship's total operating expenses by approximately 1% over the PO-based scheme and by at least 3% over schemes that do not use machine learning methods. In the long run, SPO-based ship maintenance plans also improve the efficiency of port logistics by reducing the resources needed for formal PSC inspections and alleviating port congestion.","","article","","172","","","A smart predict-then-optimize method for targeted and cost-effective maritime transportation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019126152300053X","0191-2615","2023","32-52","Transportation Research Part B: Methodological"

One of the keys to success is having pertinent data. Knowing how maritime uses unfold in a spatio-temporal context, and what conflicting or synergistic interactions exist between activities, is crucial. However, this information is especially hard to obtain in a marine environment. As a result this information has often been identified as the missing layer in information systems developed by maritime stakeholders. Since 2002, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has been undergoing a major development. Allowing for real time geo-tracking and identification for equipped vessels, the data that issues from AIS data promises to map and describe certain marine human activities. After recapitulating the main characteristics of AIS and the data it provides, this article proposes to evaluate how AIS is currently used in MSP at a European level, and to concisely present a series of methods and results obtained within the framework of several operational research projects. The objective is to illustrate how the AIS data processing and analysis can produce adequate information for MSP: maritime traffic density, shipping lanes and navigation flows, hierarchical network of maritime routes, alleged fishing zones, spatio-temporal interactions between activities (potential conflicting uses or synergies). The conclusion looks in particular at the legal questions concerning the use of AIS.","","article","","166","","","How can Automatic Identification System (AIS) data be used for maritime spatial planning?","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569117305999","0964-5691","2018","18-30","Ocean & Coastal Management"

Accordingly, vessel traffic service system (VTS) is capable of assisting the maritime department to complete real-time supervision of a certain water area and increasing the efficiency of water supervision. However, the VTS system has low effectiveness in vessel anomaly detection and supervision, thus resulting in regulatory blind spot in the VTS system. In this study, a vessel trajectory anomaly detection mechanism is developed using the immune genetic spectral clustering method. Moreover, the contour coefficient of scatter clustering is accurately analyzed, and the clustering center is optimized using the adopted method. On that basis, different abnormal features can be detected, and abnormal detection accuracy can be increased. In this study, the vessel trajectory anomaly detection model is built in accordance with the set sliding window and abnormal threshold parameters of vessel trajectory characteristics. The AIS data of Lianyungang to Qingdao port from March 2021 are selected for experimental analysis.

Using aerosol model reanalysis products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), values of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the MC were collected and processed to obtain a better understanding of the characteristics of the aerosol loading over the MC. Using the varimax rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) approach, we assess the spatio-temporal distributions of the AOD over the MC from 2001 to 2020. The REOF maximized the variances explained for the primary modes and has shown clearer relationship between the spatiotemporal patterns of identified modes. The first three REOF modes of the AOD accounted for a total variance of 73.7%. The first mode (REOF1) explaining 35.8% is the main mode that represent fire burning that concentrated over the 0° latitude. REOF1 represents the emission from burning activities which primarily occurred in the Kalimantan and Sumatra based on their correlation with the total hotspots, which reach 0.73, which a certain extent of correlation with the climate anomalies, including El Niño, positive DM, and their coincidence.

The empirical study is based on a collection of AIS vessel tracking data, spanning over a year. The scope of the study limits the AIS data area to the Baltic region (9-31°E, 53-66°N), which experiences some of the most dense maritime traffic in the world. The investigations employ a novel maritime traffic modeling method based on the potential fields concept, adapted for this study to facilitate the examination of concept drift. The concept drift is made apparent in course of the statistical and visual analysis of the experimental results. This study shows a number of particular cases, in which the maritime traffic is affected by concept drifts of varying extent and character. The visual representations of the traffic models make shifts in the traffic patterns apparent and comprehensible to human eye. Based on the experimental outcomes, the robustness of the modeling method against concept drift in traffic is discussed and improvements are proposed.

Traditional risk estimation approaches, which can only analyze traffic risk in one specific scale, reveal a significant challenge in quantifying the collision risk of a traffic scenario from different spatial scales. This is detrimental to understanding the traffic situations and supporting effective anti-collision decision-making, particularly as maritime traffic complexity grows and autonomous ships emerge. In this study, a systematic multi-scale collision risk estimation approach is newly developed to capture traffic conflict patterns under different spatial scales. It extends the application of the complex network theory and a node deletion method to quantify the interactions and dependencies among multiple ships within encounter scenarios, enabling collision risk to be evaluated at any spatial scale. Meanwhile, an advanced graph-based clustering framework is introduced to search for the optimal spatial scales for risk evaluation. Extensive numerical experiments based on AIS data in Ningbo_Zhoushan Port are implemented to evaluate the model performance.

Many anomaly detection algorithms based on trajectories have been proposed for this problem. However, these algorithms generally have problems such as complex parameter setting, unfaithful statistical model, not well-calibrated false alarm rate, poor ability of online learning and sequential anomaly detection, etc. The theory of conformal prediction was introduced to solve these problems by constructing the sequential Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector. Yet, it only considers position information of the targets and is not sensitive to velocity and course anomaly behaviors. And the run times are increasing as the increase of the data size, which is not appropriate for early warning surveillance application. In order to solve these problems, sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNCAD) and sequential multi-factor Hausdorff nearest neighbor inductive conformal anomaly detector (SMFHNNICAD) based on multidimensional trajectories are proposed in this paper.

However, accurately detecting waypoints is challenging due to potential AIS data quality issues (i.e., missing or inaccurate messages). In this paper, we propose a five-step learning approach (SafeWay) to estimate waypoints on a given AIS trajectory. First, we interpolate trajectories to tackle AIS data quality issues. Then, we annotate historical trajectories by using an existing waypoint library that contains historical waypoints. As the historical waypoints are passage plans manually created by port operators considering sailing conditions at that time, they are not specific to other historical trajectories between the same ports. We, therefore, use a similarity metric to determine overlapping segments of historical trajectories with the historical waypoints from the waypoint library. Then, we build a transformer model to capture vessel movement patterns based on speed- and location-related features. We do not process location features directly to avoid learning location-specific context, but take into account tailored delta features. We test our approach on a real-world AIS dataset collected from the Norwegian Sea between Å lesund and Måløy and show its effectiveness in terms of a harmonic mean of purity and coverage, mean absolute error and detection rate on the task of detecting trajectory waypoints compared to a state-of-the-art approach. We also show the effectiveness of the trained model on the trajectories obtained from two other regions, the North Sea (London and Rotterdam) and the North Atlantic Ocean (Setubal and Gibraltar), on which the model has not been trained.

First, the vessels monitored are clustered using DBSCAN to obtain the clusters of encounter vessels, filtering out the relatively safe vessels. Then, the dynamic motion relation between encounter vessels within each cluster is modeled to obtain DCPA and TCPA. The semantic and mathematical relationship of vessel collision risk index for each cluster of encounter vessels with DCPA and TCAP is constructed using a negative exponential function. To illustrate the effectiveness of the framework proposed, an experimental case study has been carried out within the west coastal waters of Sweden. The results show that our framework is effective and efficient at detecting and ranking collision risk indexes between encounter vessels within each cluster, which allows an automatic risk prioritization of encounter vessels for further investigation by operators.

In addition, although recent research efforts have widely focused on machine learning methods to predict fuel consumption, studies on hyperparameter values that are suitable for these prediction models are limited. To compensate for this deficiency in existing literature, an adaptive hyperparameter tuning method is proposed, and the effects of maritime environmental factors on fuel consumption are taken into account. Through experimentation, the proposed adaptive hyperparameter tuning method was validated via artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The hyperparameter tuning proportionally increased the amplitudes of the coefficients of determination (R2) of these algorithms. The increase of the amplitude demonstrated the following trend, in the order of the largest increase to the lowest increase: ANN, Lasso, SVM, and RF. The rates of increase were between 0.0773% and 2.1653%. Furthermore, after the environmental factors were considered, the prediction accuracies of the ANN and Lasso increased; however, the opposite was observed for the SVR and RF. As such, we confirmed that the use of Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning can effectively improve the fuel consumption prediction accuracy, and our proposed model can therefore serve as a significant reference for calculating fuel consumption.","","article","","7","","","An adaptive hyper parameter tuning model for ship fuel consumption prediction under complex maritime environments","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468013321000759","2468-0133","2022","255-263","Journal of Ocean Engineering and Science"

The commonest acquisition method relies on shipborne acoustic systems (e.g. multibeam echosounder). However, most of the world’s seabed has not been surveyed using these methods. Derivation of bathymetry from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry: SDB) can redress this in shallow (<20–30 m depth) clear water. It can be derived empirically using depth control points, or independent of control data through physics-based approaches. Given global satellite coverage, it is applicable almost anywhere with suitable water conditions and is becoming increasingly widespread in the hydrographic survey community. However, archaeological application of SDB is almost totally un-investigated. This paper examines the utility of SDB for maritime archaeology through 2 case studies: the ancient harbours of Tyre (Lebanon) and Ras Ibn Hani (Syria). Tested data comprise 2 m-resolution physics-based commercial SDB and medium-resolution (10–30 m) SDB empirically derived from open access multispectral imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). SDB was assessed for its ability to detect submerged cultural features and landforms and as input into palaeo-geographic reconstructions. Tested SDB performed poorly for feature detection, but was better-suited to landform identification and palaeo-geographic reconstruction. SDB also has clear advantages: low cost, wide area coverage, speed and data availability. Disadvantages include variable accuracy, technical limitations (e.g. need for clear water) and approach-specific requirements (e.g. depth control points for empirical and complex modelling for physics-based approaches). For maritime archaeology, its current limitations means that it will not replace acoustics for prospection and imaging but it does have utility for submerged landscape investigation and reconstruction, particularly in areas which now only have no/poor bathymetric data.","","article","","38","","","Satellite-derived bathymetry for maritime archaeology: Testing its effectiveness at two ancient harbours in the Eastern Mediterranean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X2100242X","2352-409X","2021","103030","Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports"

These are typically detected in data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Recognizing the significant interest in this approach, this article provides a review and analysis of methods based on the detection of non-accident critical events from AIS data, which aim to provide insight into maritime waterway risk. Considering also recent calls for increased focus on foundational issues in risk research and safety science, each method in the literature is critically reviewed based on five questions: How are non-accident critical events defined? What is the accident-theoretical basis of the method? How are non-accident critical events ranked? How is the method used? To what extent has the method been validated? Based on the results, it is concluded that focus is needed to build evidence of the validity of the models’ results, if these are to be effectively used for waterway risk analysis. As a prerequisite, more focus is needed on how exactly non-accident critical events are defined, and what factors are involved in the relation between their occurrence and accident involvement.","","article","","200","","","Review and analysis of methods for assessing maritime waterway risk based on non-accident critical events detected from AIS data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832018305386","0951-8320","2020","106933","Reliability Engineering & System Safety"

Digitalization is one of the enablers of autonomous operation, with installing new sensors and using the data for AI and machine learning. The trend is to move the handling the vast amount of data from sensors, installed in machines, and devices, close to the sensors. This way, data communication can be heavily reduced, while the latency of decisions based on data can be minimal. This is achieved by moving the advanced data analysis capabilities from the cloud to the edge. In this paper, the driver of technological development is the concept of an unmanned machine room, where the normal inspections performed by personnel are automated using sensors and algorithms.We present an analysis of vibration data, recorded at a cruise ferry\x92s engines, using a signal processing method called cepstrums. A cepstrum is a version of frequency analysis, intending to identify and visualize periodic structures in data using cepstrograms. Compared to spectrogram analysis, usage of cepstrogram enables better visualization of engine behavior into the shape of audio signals. This helped us discover the run-time vibration routine of the engines from where we could observe unusual vibration sensing generated from the engine.

Semantic integration is at the core of our navigation model. Semantic integration is the process of interrelating information from diverse sources, by using a commonly adopted description of the application field. For this work, reports are not enriched by semantic annotations, but they are processed in order to represent each document in the form of vectors of numerical values and sets of concepts augmented by corresponding weight values. Weight values are used to take into account the relevance of each concept for a given document. In a similar way, user queries are defined by numerical values and sets of ontological entities. The navigation model implements two information retrieval strategies: finding retrieves specific events occurring in specific areas while explaining highlights clues to explain abnormal vessel behaviors. Search results are provided by a ranking scheme based on both the semantic similarity between document and query and values of weights. Supported with complex domain knowledge, our navigation model offers intelligent means to assist experts while exploring the collection of interpretation reports.

To identify and map the traffic complexity effectively, this paper proposes a dynamic maritime traffic complexity model based on radial distribution functions. For modelling the traffic complexity, three sub complexity models are established first by addressing the speed, course and position of the ships. For each sub-model, the main variable is used for building the radial distribution function model, and a variation method is used to estimate the complexity. Finally, the overall traffic complexity can be identified and mapped by synthesizing the results from the three sub-models. The AIS data in the northern Yellow Sea of China is used for validating the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can effectively identify the traffic complexity in the studied sea area, and have an advantage in some special sea area compared with the previous traffic complexity model. By applying the proposed model, maritime surveillance operators can better monitor the real-time traffic situation and improve their working efficiency, which are crucial for the improvement of navigational safety.","","article","","241","","","Modelling dynamic maritime traffic complexity with radial distribution functions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801821013305","0029-8018","2021","109990","Ocean Engineering"

To speed up incipient ionospheric anomaly detection, this paper proposes a novel method for the DGNSS stations which employs (1) the Wasserstein distance (WD) to identify dissimilarity between GNSS pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements and (2) the least-mean-square (LMS) filter to smooth the calculated metrics. The combined WD-LMS is proposed to ensure the rapid identification of abnormal ionospheric divergences. Taking the multipath into account, which is especially severe in the low elevation angle case, elevation-angle related strategies are developed.

However, data collected from the ship’s engine and navigation information include various types of errors owing to imprecision, bias, sensor failure, or human error caused by manual recording by the ship operator’s hands. Such abnormal data make accurate ship performance prediction and monitoring difficult; thus, the original data need to be carefully refined through data preprocessing. Machine learning models have been used to detect and remove abnormal data; however, this yields inconsistent predictions in results depending on the types of machine learning models used. In this study, a robust data gap analysis method is proposed to detect abnormal data among ship and marine data collected in real time. Data preprocessing, including rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension reduction, is systematically performed; subsequently, a meta-learning model, which is a combination of various machine learning models, is used to predict ship performance and detect its abnormal data. This study compared the performance of single-machine learning models and meta models through various error analysis methods that utilize actual ship operation data. The single machine leading models have various error values depending on types of data and models, while the meta model consistently has values of less than 5% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), showing a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient(NSE) value of 0.7 or higher.

The method's novelty lies in employing the concept of a potential field for AIS vessel tracking data abstraction and maritime traffic representation. Unlike the traditional maritime surveillance equipment, such as radar or GPS, the AIS system comprehensively represents the identity and properties of a vessel, as well as its behavior, thus preserving the effects of navigational decisions, based on the skills of experienced seamen. In the developed data modeling process, every vessel generates potential charges, which value represent the vessel's behavior, and drops the charges at locations it passes. Each AIS report is used to assign a potential charge at the reported vessel positions. The method derives three construction elements, which define, firstly, how charges are accumulated, secondly, how a charge decays over time, and thirdly, in what way the potential is distributed around the source charge. The collection of potential fields represents a model of normal behavior, and vessels not conforming to it are marked as anomalous. In the anomaly detection prototype system STRAND, the sensitivity of anomaly detection can be modified by setting a geographical coordinate grid precision to more dense or coarse. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal grid size for two different conditions – an open sea and a port area case. A noticeable shift can be observed between the results for the open sea and the port area. The plotted detection rates converge towards an optimal ratio for smaller grid sizes in the port area (60-200 meters), than in the open sea case (300-1000 meters).

We find that in a crowded scene the application of Mutual Information based social context permits the ability to prevent self-justifying groups and propagate anomalies in a social network, granting a greater anomaly detection capability.

As a comparison, we focus on the evaluation of the anomalies of driving habits for different drivers based on their trajectory data. This is particularly important for the application of adjusting the amount of insurance in accordance with the driving behaviors. Instead of customizing rules for modeling various driving behaviors, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for driving trajectory anomaly detection, called STDTB-AD. Specifically, taking into account the fact that movement is spatial–temporal dependent, the study first partitions the whole road network into a series of spatial–temporal units, which have homogeneous properties of traffic flows. Then, the motion parameters (i.e., acceleration, speed, and direction) of driving trajectories falling within each spatio-temporal unit are calculated for representing context-aware features of drivers. This method is able to detect the deviation of movement from the normal traffic state on the spatial–temporal units. Finally, a variational autoencoder is utilized to quantify the abnormity degree of each driver according to the reconstruction probability of driving feature vector. Evaluations based on taxi trajectory data show that our model can consider both the spatial and temporal contexts for detecting driving behavior anomalies and achieve higher detection accuracy than traditional models based on either spatial or temporal context.","","article","","115","","","A deep encoder-decoder network for anomaly detection in driving trajectory behavior under spatio-temporal context","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156984322200303X","1569-8432","2022","103115","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation"

Thus, a critical understanding of the behavior of anomalies is increasingly becoming very important for air pollution investigations. This study was conducted to detect anomalies in daily PM10 functional data, to investigate the patterns of behavior as well as to identify possible factors that determine PM10 anomalies at three selected air quality monitoring stations (Klang, Kuala Selangor and Petaling Jaya) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The statistical method employed to detect these anomalies consisted of a combination of the robust projection pursuit and the robust Mahalanobis distance methods using air quality data recorded from 2005 to 2010. Analysis of obtained anomalous PM10 profiles showed that data recorded during El Nino years (2005, 2006 and 2009) contained the highest frequency of anomalies. More frequent anomalies appeared during the southwest (SW) monsoon which occurs in the months of July and August as well as during the northeast (NE) monsoon in February. A lesser number of anomalies were also observed during weekends compared to weekdays. The weekend and monsoonal effect phenomena were shown to be significantly existent at all stations while wind speed was positively associated with extreme PM10 anomalies at the Klang and Petaling Jaya stations. In conclusion, anomalies detection was found useful for air pollution investigation in this study. The findings of this study imply that the location and background of a station, as well as wind speed, seasonal (monsoon) and weekdays-weekend variations play important role in influencing PM10 anomalies.","","article","","6","","","Anomaly detection and assessment of PM10 functional data at several locations in the Klang Valley, Malaysia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104215302440","1309-1042","2015","365-375","Atmospheric Pollution Research"

Traditional approaches for trajectory prediction face challenges in accurately quantifying uncertainties, thereby limiting effectiveness in decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid interval prediction frame of vessel trajectory using the lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE) and attention-modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network with bayesian optimization (BO). Firstly, trajectory data is preprocessed to solve the scale irregularity. Then, a novel trajectory interval prediction model for perceiving the prediction uncertainties is designed based on an advanced attention-modified LSTM with interval prediction capability. Meanwhile, a supervised training strategy with differentiating the interval widths of latitude and longitude is put forward to devise sample labels for training the model. Additionally, a new prediction interval-based objective function is proposed considering the target of maximizing coverage and minimizing width of trajectory interval. The BO algorithm optimizes the weighted parameters in the LSTM network by minimizing the objective function value. Finally, cases from two water areas are implemented to test and verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach in (1) outperforming other methods used for comparison in both coverage probability and width criteria of prediction interval.

First, a composite similarity measure is designed using a probabilistic conflict detection approach and a newly formulated maritime traffic route network learned through maritime knowledge mining. Then, an extended graph-based clustering framework is used to produce balanced traffic clusters with high intra-connections but low inter-connections. The proposed methodology is thoroughly demonstrated and tested using Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data in the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology 1) has effective performance in decomposing the traffic complexity, 2) can assist in identifying high-risk/density traffic clusters, and 3) is sufficiently generic to handle various traffic scenarios in complex geographical waters.

This study aims to develop a novel unsupervised methodology for feature extraction and knowledge discovery based on automatic identification system (AIS) data, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support trajectory data mining. The unsupervised hierarchical methodology is constructed from three parts: trajectory compression, trajectory similarity measure, and trajectory clustering. In the first part, an adaptive Douglas–Peucker with speed (ADPS) algorithm is created to preserve critical features, obtain useful information, and simplify trajectory information. Then, dynamic time warping (DTW) is utilized to measure the similarity between trajectories as the critical indicator in trajectory clustering. Finally, the improved spectral clustering with mapping (ISCM) is presented to extract vessel traffic behavior characteristics and mine movement patterns for enhancing marine safety and situational awareness. Comprehensive experiments are conducted and implemented in the Chengshan Jiao Promontory in China to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel methodology. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can effectively compress the trajectories, determine the number of clusters in advance, guarantee the clustering accuracy, and extract useful navigation knowledge while significantly reducing the computational cost.

Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data.

The system is able to detect wing loss with a high degree of accuracy on gliders unseen during the models training, highlighting the generality of the model to different platforms. Additionally, the VAE method outperforms model-based solution for the detection of biofouling, proving its generality to different types of anomalies. The proposed smart anomaly detection will contribute to increasing the capacity of AUVs and reducing the dependence on support vessels and experienced pilots.","","article","","120","","","Smart anomaly detection for Slocum underwater gliders with a variational autoencoder with long short-term memory networks","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141118721004880","0141-1187","2022","103030","Applied Ocean Research"

The approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the Automatic Identification System in terms of ship types, sizes, final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of Portugal. The approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships’ navigational behaviour are observed, such as changes in heading, using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms. This provides a vector-based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection. The maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile, which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route. In the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the Douglas and Peucker algorithm and clustered by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. The proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off Cape Roca to the ports of Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines. Finally, an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided.","","article","","198","","","Data mining approach to shipping route characterization and anomaly detection based on AIS data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801820300202","0029-8018","2020","106936","Ocean Engineering"

For instance, in the maritime domain, models that classify the types of ships based on their trajectories and other features perform well, but give no further explanation for their predictions. To gain the trust of human operators responsible for critical decisions, the reason behind the classification is crucial. In this paper, we introduce explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches to the task of classification of ship types. This supports decision-making by providing explanations in terms of the features contributing the most towards the prediction, along with their corresponding time intervals. In the case of the LIME explainer, we adapt the time-slice mapping technique (LimeforTime), while for Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and path integrated gradient (PIG), we represent the relevance of each input variable to generate a heatmap as an explanation. In order to validate the XAI results, the existing perturbation and sequence analyses for classifiers of univariate time series data is employed for testing and evaluating the XAI explanations on multivariate time series. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation technique to assess the quality of explanations yielded by the chosen XAI method.","","article","","58","","","Validation of XAI explanations for multivariate time series classification in the maritime domain","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750321001976","1877-7503","2022","101539","Journal of Computational Science"

In order to ensure the safety of such electric ships, it is of paramount importance to monitor the available energy that can be stored in the batteries, and classification societies typically require that the state of health of the batteries can be verified by independent tests — annual capacity tests. However, this paper discusses data-driven state of health modelling for maritime battery systems based on operational sensor data collected from the batteries as an alternative approach. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive review of different data-driven approaches to state of health modelling, and aims at giving an overview of current state of the art. More than 300 papers have been reviewed, most of which are referred to in this paper. Moreover, some reflections and discussions on what types of approaches can be suitable for modelling and independent verification of state of health for maritime battery systems are presented.","","article","","43","","","Data-driven state of health modelling—A review of state of the art and reflections on applications for maritime battery systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X21008598","2352-152X","2021","103158","Journal of Energy Storage"

A maritime traffic network abstraction consisting of nodes that represent waypoint areas and navigational legs is constructed to represent the maritime traffic at a larger scale. Multinomial Logistic Regression and Gaussian Process regression models are developed and applied for predicting probabilistically the ships’ destinations and their trajectories along the ship route, respectively. Based on these models, the uncertainty on the ship's future position can be estimated given its current state. The proposed method is capable of long-term ship position prediction and provides information on the maritime traffic 10, 30 and 60 min ahead when the method is applied to all ships navigating in a study area.

Furthermore, this is linked to the environmental conditions in which the PV plants operate. In this study, the performance degradation of a 302.4 kWp solar PV power plant is investigated over the first five years of operation in the desert maritime climate of Djibouti. The analysis is led on collected data extracted from the PV installation and that have been pre-processed and filtered. For this purpose, several criteria have been introduced to identify anomalies such as grid outages. Then, the power degradation rate was considered using Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications (PVUSA) regression analysis and Performance Ratio (PR) analysis based on continuous monitoring data at 1-min intervals. The degradation rates were found to be 1.01 ± 0.38%/year for PR and 0.085 ± 0.68%/year for PVUSA.

Aerial detection presents several key challenges over ground-based detection. For one, larger and more rapid background fluctuations are typical due to higher speeds, larger field of view, and geographically induced background changes. As well, the possible large altitude or stand-off distance variations cause significant steps in background count rate as well as spectral changes due to increased gamma-ray scatter with detection at higher altitudes. The work here details the adaptation and optimization of the PNNL-developed algorithm Nuisance-Rejecting Spectral Comparison Ratios for Anomaly Detection (NSCRAD), a spectral anomaly method previously developed for ground-based applications, for an aerial platform. The algorithm has been optimized for two multi-detector systems; a NaI(Tl)-detector-based system and a CsI detector array. The optimization here details the adaptation of the spectral windows for a particular set of target sources to aerial detection and the tailoring for the specific detectors. As well, the methodology and results for background rejection methods optimized for the aerial gamma-ray detection using Potassium, Uranium and Thorium (KUT) nuisance rejection are shown.

This study aims at investigating the application of deep learning in both short- and long-term predictions of different types of accident risks associated with small vessels by considering multiple influencing factors.

Four machine learning and six deep learning algorithms are implemented and compared in nine scenarios with three different grid sizes using daily, weekly, and monthly models. The results reveal that although the performance of the proposed deep spatiotemporal ocean accident prediction (DSTOAP) model varies according to grid sizes and time intervals, its accuracy (more than 78%) makes it reliable for predicting accidents. Furthermore, although all types of accidents are captured with high accuracy, more than 84% of collision accidents can be predicted accurately.

Even though a considerable fraction of the total stock is stored in the subsoil, current assessments often consider the topsoil only. Furthermore, mapping efforts are hampered by the limited spatial density of these topsoil measurements. The aim of this study was to assess the SOC stock in the upper 100cm of soil in 30,556ha of Low-Input High-Diversity systems, such as nature reserves, in Flanders (Belgium) and compare this estimate with the stock found in the topsoil (upper 15cm). To this end, we combined depth extrapolation of 139 measurements limited to the topsoil with four digital soil mapping techniques: multiple linear regression, boosted regression trees, artificial neural networks and least-squares support vector machines. Particular attention was given to vegetation characteristics as predictors. For both the stock in the upper 15cm and 100cm, a boosted regression trees approach was most informative as it resulted in the lowest cross-validation errors and provided insights in the relative importance of predictors. The predictors of the stock in the upper 100cm were soil type, groundwater level, clay fraction and community weighted mean (CWM) and variance (CWV) of plant height. These predictors, together with the CWM of specific leaf area, aboveground biomass production, CWV and CWM of rooting depth, terrain slope, CWM of mycorrhizal associations and species diversity also explained the topsoil stock. Our total stock estimates show that focusing on the topsoil (1.63Tg OC) only considers 36% of the stock in the upper 100cm (4.53Tg OC). Given the magnitude of subsoil OC and its dependency on typical ecosystem characteristics, it should not be neglected in regional ecosystem service assessments.","","article","","589","","","Assessing top- and subsoil organic carbon stocks of Low-Input High-Diversity systems using soil and vegetation characteristics","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717303649","0048-9697","2017","153-164","Science of The Total Environment"

It consists of marine and continental sediments that are affected by folding movements. In the upper section, the continental coal-bearing Campano-Maastrichtian-age is found within Gombe Sandstone and the Cenozoic Kerri-Kerri Formation of the Tertiary. In the middle segment, the late Turonian/early Santonian coal-bearing Awgu Formation lies conformably on the Ezeaku Formation. In the lower part, shales at Nkporo mark marine incursion and deposition of the Maastrichtian Mamu Formation coal measures. Cretaceous coal samples taken from the three segments of Benue Trough basin were examined using ultimate and proximate, organic petrographic, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation-induced coupled plasma spectroscopy (LA-ICPMS) analytical techniques. Results of trace element ratios, Ce/Ce* values (“where Ce* is the theoretical Ce value derived from a chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) pattern”), authigenic uranium values, and low hydrogen content indicate deposition under oxic to suboxic conditions. However, the V/Ni and V/Sc ratios indicate under oxic, suboxic to reducing conditions. The Y/Ho values for selected coals are lower than the range for seawater, indicating terrigenous influence. The Sr/Ba values indicate low influence of saline water during deposition and a strong continental rather than marine influence. High value of vitrinite and low proportion of liptinite/intertinite suggest that peat in the study areas were situated on the irregular basin floor where sediment thicknesses vary from place to place thus the depositional environments shifted causing mineral matter filling in coal. Based on the tissue preservation index (TPI) and gelification index (GI), LFB, CHK, OKB, LMZ, IMG; and ENG (high GI and high TPI) were deposited in telmatic facies; wet-forest swamps with rapid organic matter accumulation. This trend indicates mild humification and strong gelification of plant tissues which ascribed to high rate of subsidence with wood- and bark-derived telovitrinite. The MGA peats were deposited in terrestrial facies in a dry-forest swamp with wood-derived telo-inertinite. The coal samples code-named IMG and ENG were deposited in planar margin mires. However, coal samples code-named LFB, CHK and LMZ were deposited in planar central mires. Lastly, OKB and MGA were deposited in transitional-wet and transitional-dry mire. The low V and Ni concentrations, low H/C, high O/C, high C/N, and very low N/C ratios <0.05 implies Type III land-plant organic matter that is not oil-prone. The depositional environments interpretations of investigated coal seams indicate that the coals were deposited within a telmatic, limnic, limno-telmatic and open march zone. Generally, a combination of results from inorganic geochemistry and organic petrology is required for precise and all-inclusive determination of coal depositional environments.","","article","","137","","","Elemental geochemistry and organic facies of selected cretaceous coals from the Benue Trough basin in Nigeria: Implication for paleodepositional environments","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817221005936","0264-8172","2022","105490","Marine and Petroleum Geology"

Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glaciers were the most extensive, reaching 6km in length and descending to an altitude of 2150m above sea level. These glaciers started retreating 21.3±0.9ka (1σ) ago. They readvanced and retreated by 14.6±1.2ka ago (Lateglacial), and again by 9.3±0.5ka ago (Early Holocene). The latest advance took place 3.8±0.4ka ago (Late Holocene). Using glacier modeling together with paleoclimate proxy data from the region, we reconstructed the paleoclimate at these four discrete times. The results show that LGM climate was 8–11°C colder than today and moisture levels were somewhat similar to modern values, with a range between 20% more and 25% less than today. The analysis of Lateglacial advance suggests that the climate was colder by 4.5–6.4°C based on up to 1.5 times wetter conditions. The Early Holocene was 2.1–4.9°C colder and up to twice as wet as today, while the Late Holocene was 2.4–3°C colder and its precipitation amounts approached to similar conditions as today. Our paleoclimate reconstructions show a general trend of warming for the last 22ka, and an increase of moisture until Early Holocene, and a decrease after that time. The recent glacier terminates at 3450m on the northwest side of the mountain. It is a remnant from the last advance (possibly during the Little Ice Age). Repeated measurements of glacier length between 1902 and 2008 reveal a retreat rate of 4.2m per year, which corresponds to a warming rate of 0.9–1.2°C per century.","","article","","28","","","Glaciations and paleoclimate of Mount Erciyes, central Turkey, since the Last Glacial Maximum, inferred from 36Cl cosmogenic dating and glacier modeling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379109001425","0277-3791","2009","2326-2341","Quaternary Science Reviews"

This variability in tuna catches remains poorly explained. The relationships between the distributions of tuna and their forage (micronekton) have been mostly derived from model estimates. Observations of micronekton and other mid-trophic level organisms, and their link to regional oceanography, however are scarce and constitute an important gap in our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of pelagic ecosystems. To fill this gap, we conducted two multidisciplinary cruises (Nectalis1 and Nectalis2) in the New Caledonian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at the southeastern edge the Coral Sea, in 2011 to characterize the oceanography of the region during the cool (August) and the hot (December) seasons. The physical and biological environments were described by hydrology, nutrients and phytoplankton size structure and biomass. Zooplankton biomass was estimated from net sampling and acoustics and micronecton was estimated from net sampling, the SEAPODYM ecosystem model, a dedicated echosounder and non-dedicated acoustics. Results demonstrated that New Caledonia is located in an oligotrophic area characterized by low nutrient and low primary production which is dominated by a high percentage of picoplankton cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus (>90%). The area exhibits a large-scale north–south temperature and salinity gradient. The northern area is influenced by the equatorial Warm Pool and the South Pacific Convergence Zone and is characterized by higher temperature, lower salinity, lower primary production and micronekton biomass. The southern area is influenced by the Tasman Sea and is characterized by cooler temperature, higher salinity, higher primary production and micronekton biomass. The dynamic oceanography and the complex topography create a myriad of mesoscale features including eddies, inducing patchy structures in the ecosystem. During the cool season, a tight coupling existed between the ocean dynamics and primary production, while there was a stronger decoupling during the hot season. There was little difference in the composition of mid-trophic level organisms (zooplankton and micronekton) between the two seasons. This may be due to different turn-over times and delays in the transmission of primary production to upper trophic levels. Examination of various sampling gears for zooplankton and micronekton showed that net biomass estimates and acoustic-derived estimates compared reasonably well. Estimates of micronekton from net observations and the SEAPODYM model were in the same range. The non-dedicated acoustics adequately reproduced trends observed in zooplankton from nets, but the acoustics could not differentiate between zooplankton and micronekton and absolute biomasses could not be calculated. Understanding the impact of mesoscale features on higher trophic levels will require further investigation and patchiness induced by eddies raises the question of how to best sample highly dynamic areas via sea experiments.","","article","","113","","","Seasonal oceanography from physics to micronekton in the south-west Pacific","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064514003038","0967-0645","2015","125-144","Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography"

Among them, suspension-feeders, like bivalve molluscs are widely used in trophic web studies. The main goal of this study was to investigate variations of C and N elemental and isotopic ratios in common bivalves (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and C. gigas) at large spatial (i.e. among three coastal regions) and different temporal (i.e. from seasonal to multi-decadal) scales in France, in order to identify potential general or specific patterns and speculate on their drivers. The observed spatial variability was related to the trophic status of the coastal regions (oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea versus meso- to eutrophic English Channel and Atlantic ocean), but not to ecosystem typology (estuaries, versus lagoons versus bays versus littoral systems). Furthermore, it highlighted local specificities in terms of the origin of the POM assimilated by bivalves (e.g., mainly continental POM vs. marine phytoplankton vs. microphytobenthic algae). Likewise, seasonal variability was related both to the reproduction cycle for C/N ratios of Mytilus spp. and to changes in trophic resources for δ13C of species located close to river mouth. Multi-decadal evolution exhibited shifts and trends for part of the 30-year series with decreases in δ13C and δ15N. Specifically, shifts appeared in the early 2000's, likely linking bivalve isotopic ratios to a cascade of processes affected by local drivers.","","article","","613-614","","","Carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic ratios of filter-feeding bivalves along the French coasts: An assessment of specific, geographic, seasonal and multi-decadal variations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717323021","0048-9697","2018","196-207","Science of The Total Environment"

This chapter first presents the consideration of light incidence and reflection angles to the calculation of surface albedo. Then, the retrieval method of spectral albedo based on bidirectional reflectance models inversion and narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversion is discussed. The next section describes the direct-estimation approaches that retrieve surface broadband albedo directly from single-angle surface reflectance or top-of-atmosphere reflectance, which can be easily adopted in operational global albedo production. After that, the available global land surface albedo remote sensing products and application examples of phenology analysis based on global surface albedo products is briefly reviewed. In the end, a short discussion is given on the cutting-edge problems in global surface albedo estimation.","","incollection","Academic Press","","Advanced Remote Sensing (Second Edition)","978-0-12-815826-5","Chapter 6 - Broadband albedo","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128158265000064","","2020","193-250",""

Five aircraft flights were flown along a north-south transect between about 147 ° W and 152 ° W, and extending from about 63° N (south of Fairbanks, Alaska) to the Arctic Ocean coastline, with an Aircraft Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) on-board operating at 92 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, and 18 GHz. Passive microwave data from the satellite-borne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), operating at 85.5 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, 18 GHz, and 10 GHz, were obtained concurrently. A good correspondence in brightness temperature (TB) trends between the aircraft and satellite data was found. However, an expected inverse correlation between depth hoar thickness and TB was not found to be strong. A persistent TB minimum in both the aircraft and the satellite data was detected along the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. In an area located at about 68° 50'N, 149° 20'W, the TB as recorded from the aircraft microwave sensor dropped by 55 K. Satellite microwave measurements showed a TB decrease of up to 45 K at approximately the same location. Snow pit measurements did not reveal notable differences in snow characteristics or depth in this location. An examination of passive microwave satellite data from 1978 to 1987 revealed that similar low latewinter TB values were found in approximately the same locations as those observed in March 1988. According to the satellite data, the zone of low TB develops as the snow deepens, and reaches the lowest values in March or April each year. The cause of this TB minimum is unknown but thought to be related to snow stratigraphy. The observed difficulty in relating the ground measurements to data collected using aircraft and satellite passive microwave sensors is attributed to the fact that the snow depth and character are highly variable in central and northern Alaska. This variability is exemplified in the field measurements as well as in the passive microwave measurements.","","article","","38","","","Passive microwave remote and in situ measurements of artic and subarctic snow covers in Alaska","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003442579190086L","0034-4257","1991","161-172","Remote Sensing of Environment"

The local meteorological parameters and the origin of the air masses were investigated, notably using a Doppler Lidar, and the structure of the boundary layer was thoroughly studied using elastic Lidar measurements for the first time in Hanoi. Four heavily polluted events occurred during the campaign, which were associated with hazy days; the highest daily PM2.5 concentrations reached ~130 μg m−3 while the mean concentration during the campaign was 45 ± 25 μg m−3. These severe polluted events in Hanoi were mainly related to LRT coming from China besides local emission or LRT from other polluted regions of Vietnam. BLH proved to be one of the key factors controlling air pollution in Hanoi. Indeed, the elastic Lidar measurements showed that the daily maximum of the hourly BLH varied from 700m to 1200m during cloudy days, while it was always below 1000m during hazy days. The lower BLH on the hazy days weakened the vertical mixing and was directly related to an increase in aerosol concentrations at the surface.","","article","","12","","","Key factors explaining severe air pollution episodes in Hanoi during 2019 winter season","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104221001343","1309-1042","2021","101068","Atmospheric Pollution Research"

Two types of material were discharged in the bight of Mecklenburg in the Baltic Sea in approximately 20 m of water depth. One set of the discharges was 2900 m3 of glacial till and the other set was a 2400 m3 mixture of glacial till, sand and minor amounts of cohesive matter. Only approximately 2500 m3 (86%) of the glacial till and 1500 m3 (63%) of the mixed soil materials were deposited on the seabed. This means that already during the dumping process a considerable part of the sediment material drifted away. The glacial till formed crater-like rings of 30 m diameter with peaks up to 1.4 m above seabed, whereas the spatial structure of the mixed soil material was somewhat more diffuse, but with similar magnitudes in the peaks and troughs. The morphological changes were small and their quantification required a high measuring precision in the order of few cm in the vertical. The dominant processes of surface deformation was flattening of peaks and filling of troughs. The speed of this process decreased with horizontal scale: structures of less than 4 m horizontal extension had a trend to disappear within less than five years, whereas structures of larger than 8 m extension showed little change and are estimated to remain detectable for many decades. In contrast to the reworking of the matter inside the dumping structures, no net transport of material out of the dumping area could be detected. Extrapolating the observed morphological changes into the future it is estimated that without significant decrease in internal shear strength of the disposed till the structures will persist for at least 70 years. This can be attributed to the high internal stability of the dumped glacial till and the low hydrodynamic forces present at the seabed in this region.","","article","","75","","","On the morphological long-term development of dumped material in a low-energetic environment close to the German Baltic coast","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796308000845","0924-7963","2009","409-420","Journal of Marine Systems"

However, previous studies have suggested that there may be some potential for improvement and the need for a better understanding of the methodology. In this study, eight species of stored product insects were tested against known attractants to investigate certain aspects of the bioassay procedure likely to influence the sensitivity of the test. The insects tested were Ahasverus advenu, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, Rhyzopertha dominica, Prostephanus truncatus, Sitophilus granarius, S. oryzae, S. zeamais and Stegobium paniceum. The factors investigated were the test duration, pitfall lip size and arena size. For the majority of species tested, either the differentiation between control and attractant results was good, irrespective of the bioassay design, or changes to the bioassay design markedly improved the catch. However, this bioassay method may not be suitable for S. zeamais. Of the assessment periods tested, it was generally found that l h was optimal, or at least as good as the longer alternatives. Although 100 mm arena sizes generally trapped larger numbers of insects, the differentiation between treatment and control samples was optimal with differing arena sizes for the different insect species. Pitfall lip size appears to be the least important factor in increasing the differentiation between treatment and control samples. Although these findings go some way towards improving the methodology of the single pitfall bioassay, there remain some questions on the variability of the insect response under the test conditions. However, on the basis of previous experience and the studies reported here, we are able to suggest the most effective design of the single pitfall bioassay for the species tested. Recommendations for particular aspects of the bioassay design have been chosen to achieve maximum differentiation between control and attractant.","","article","","34","","","The assessment of potential attractants to beetle pests: Improvements to laboratory pitfall bioassay methods","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022474X97000192","0022-474X","1998","59-74","Journal of Stored Products Research"

In some cases, abrupt changes in the range between daily maximum and minimum temperatures are observed within annual cycles. Such discontinuities, or steps, of 5°C may occur within a week, despite the fact that the daily data are averaged over several decades. Discontinuities are most pronounced in the fall and spring, and display differing characteristics of timing, rapidity, magnitude and direction of change across the nation. In northern and central portions of the eastern U.S., a winter minimum and summer maximum in temperature range is observed, while in the southern U.S. the opposite is found. Abrupt discontinuities are observed in early November in the Northeast and in late spring and early summer in the Southeast and Southwest. Differences in mean daily temperature cycles between various portions of this century are a function of variations in maximum and minimum temperatures. The central U.S. had higher maximum and minimum temperatures during the 1930's than at other times this century, with little affect on daily temperature range. In the Northeast, the temperature range was lower in the 1930's, as a result of decreased maximum and increased minimum temperatures. The dynamics responsible for changes within the annual cycle or between different periods have not yet been unequivocally identified. The location of the polar front jet stream and its associations with solar radiation, clouds, snow cover and other atmospheric and surface variables are certainly involved. We believe that the identification of the climate system dynamics responsible for the structure of the annual cycle of daily temperature is a necessary first step in the study of potential human-induced climate change.","","article","","37","","","Some observations on climate variability as seen in daily temperature structure","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016980959400073M","0169-8095","1995","119-131","Atmospheric Research"

There are relatively few multi-element studies of dissolved trace metals in the ocean, and none from the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea. This semi-enclosed basin surrounded by desert is a natural laboratory for studying the impact of atmospheric dry deposition of trace metals on the ocean surface. We have combined measurement of dissolved metals in seawater with measurements of the flux of metals associated with dry deposition. The total dissolved trace metal concentrations in Gulf of Aqaba water are generally higher (Fe, Cu, Zn, Co, Mn, Pb) or similar (Ni, Al, Cd, Mo) to those measured in the open North Atlantic Ocean. The concentrations of elements that are highly enriched in aerosols relative to Al (e.g. Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu) are not necessarily proportionally enriched in surface seawater when compared to Al, indicative of the high reactivity of these elements in seawater. Iron concentrations in the Gulf of Aqaba are high relative to Al, despite the fact that the aerosols are not more enriched in Fe relative to Al. There may be additional sources of dissolved iron to the Gulf of Aqaba, not associated with Al. Alternatively, intense photochemically-driven redox cycling may act to enhance Fe dissolution from aerosols, or may otherwise increase the lifetime of Fe in the water column, relative to Al. Copper concentrations in the Gulf of Aqaba are close to the value found to be a threshold for Cu toxicity in this region. A surface maximum in Cd:P is found in the Gulf of Aqaba, in contrast to the more typical surface minimum in this ratio observed in other locations. The surface maximum appears to be driven by atypically low uptake of Cd relative to P. A low Cd:P uptake ratio for this region is consistent with known environmental determinants of low Cd:P uptake, such as high concentrations of dissolved Zn and Fe, and a predominance of small phytoplankton including cyanobacteria.","","article","","126","","","Evaluating the impact of atmospheric deposition on dissolved trace-metals in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420311000661","0304-4203","2011","256-268","Marine Chemistry"

The behaviour of PAN in the atmosphere has been studied at Harwell, a rural site in south-east England, using a sensitive technique with a detection limit of < 30 ppt(v). Even during winter months, daytime levels of PAN above the detection limit were always present, demonstrating the ubiquity of this molecule in the atmosphere. Results for the periods November 1974–October 1975 and January 1980–June 1981 show the existence of a pronounced seasonal variation. Maximum levels were observed during summer months, and minimum values during winter. There is a large difference between these maxima and minima, in contrast to typical patterns for ozone, and it is suggested that PAN is a better indicator of overall chemical reactivity in the lower atmosphere. Simultaneous measurement of CFCl3, was found to be a good indicator of air mass quality and anthropogenic influence; increased levels of this tracer were always associated with elevated PAN concentrations. Unexpectedly high levels of PAN during two episodes in February 1981 showed the possibility of significant photochemical activity during winter months. Back-trajectory analysis for these periods, indicated the influence of mainland European emissions and subsequent transport of photochemically-aged air masses. Similar observations of high PAN made during February 1975 suggest that the occurrence of late-winter photochemical episodes may not be uncommon.","","article","","18","","","Atmospheric measurements of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) in rural, south-east England: Seasonal variations winter photochemistry and long-range transport","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004698184903342","0004-6981","1984","2691-2702","Atmospheric Environment (1967)"

However, a comprehensive analysis of droughts, including their evolution, complexity, social implications and people's vulnerability is currently lacking. Hence, there is a pressing need for an overview of drought studies in EA. Here, we present a state-of-the-art review of the causes and impacts of, and resilience to droughts in EA. Studies reveal that droughts tend to be more frequent, longer and more severe in the boreal spring and summer in EA, as the overall precipitation and water storage abruptly decline. A decrease in drought frequency is observed during the boreal autumn season (October–November). As these studies have only been analysed within the context of sparse and short-term regional climate data with very complex spatial and seasonal climate patterns, they are subject to uncertainties. The main causes for the changing pattern of droughts include climate variabilities and anthropogenic effects. Droughts have extensive impacts on human beings, environment, water resources and agriculture. Environmental rehabilitation involving the development of ecosystem services, biodiversity enhancement and soil and water conservation is found to be a suitable strategy to adapt to drought conditions. A better understanding of the causes and impacts of droughts, participatory management and community level actions are essential for building resilience to drought. Strong citizens–government–stakeholder cooperation is also valuable in monitoring and managing drought. The knowledge and insights gained from this review will help the countries in EA to build a drought-resilient society and will form a basis of information for other regions outside of EA.","","article","","193","","","Droughts in East Africa: Causes, impacts and resilience","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825218303519","0012-8252","2019","146-161","Earth-Science Reviews"

The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess 210Pb becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century 210Pb-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000km from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate 210Pb chronologies in environmental archives from Eastern North America.","","article","","113","","","Upper Mississippi Pb as a mid-1800s chronostratigraphic marker in sediments from seasonally anoxic lakes in Eastern Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703713001336","0016-7037","2013","125-135","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

In this study we analysed the radial growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) along a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient at six locations in the polar and alpine tree-line ecotone in Finnish Lapland. We evaluated the effect of climatic trends on pine growth in relation to tree age and region, specifying a northern and a southern region in the study area. We found a response of Scots pine to climatic variations until the 1980s, but not to the current warming period. Increasing growth trends could be detected since 2000 in the radial growth of southern located trees, predominantly of juvenile ages, while the northern trees did not respond significantly to the current warming. In the north recent warmer and wetter conditions during winter time, inducing snow loads, wind damages, diseases and frost damages possibly masked the benefits of warmer conditions.

Holocene proxy time-series are increasingly used to put this amplified response in perspective by understanding Arctic climate processes beyond the instrumental period. However, available datasets are scarce, unevenly distributed and often of coarse resolution. Glaciers are sensitive recorders of climate shifts and variations in rock-flour production transfer this signal to the lacustrine sediment archives of downstream lakes. Here, we present the first full Holocene record of continuous glacier variability on Svalbard from glacier-fed Lake Hajeren. This reconstruction is based on an undisturbed lake sediment core that covers the entire Holocene and resolves variability on centennial scales owing to 26 dating points. A toolbox of physical, geochemical (XRF) and magnetic proxies in combination with multivariate statistics has allowed us to fingerprint glacier activity in addition to other processes affecting the sediment record. Evidence from variations in sediment density, validated by changes in Ti concentrations, reveal glaciers remained present in the catchment following deglaciation prior to 11,300 cal BP, culminating in a Holocene maximum between 9.6 and 9.5 ka cal BP. Correspondence with freshwater pulses from Hudson Strait suggests that Early Holocene glacier advances were driven by the melting Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). We find that glaciers disappeared from the catchment between 7.4 and 6.7 ka cal BP, following a late Hypsithermal. Glacier reformation around 4250 cal BP marks the onset of the Neoglacial, supporting previous findings. Between 3380 and 3230 cal BP, we find evidence for a previously unreported centennial-scale glacier advance. Both events are concurrent with well-documented episodes of North Atlantic cooling. We argue that this brief forcing created suitable conditions for glaciers to reform in the catchment against a background of gradual orbital cooling. These findings highlight the climate-sensitivity of the small glaciers studied, which rapidly responded to climate shifts. The start of prolonged Neoglacial glacier activity commenced during the Little Ice Age (LIA) around 700 cal BP, in agreement with reported advances from other glaciers on Svalbard. In conclusion, this study proposes a three-stage Holocene climate history of Svalbard, successively driven by LIS meltwater pulses, episodic Atlantic cooling and declining summer insolation.","","article","","126","","","Reconstruction of glacier variability from lake sediments reveals dynamic Holocene climate in Svalbard","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379115301025","0277-3791","2015","201-218","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Fire perimeters mark the separation between the burned and unburned matrix of a fire. Analysis of fire perimeters in the United States, Australia, and Alberta, have identified several key factors that influence the formation of a fire boundary, including fire environment variables, such as fuel, weather, and topographic conditions, as well as anthropogenic factors. We used matched case-control conditional logistic regression to assess the fire environment's influence on the formation of fire boundaries on the 2017 Verdant Creek Fire in the western Canadian Rocky Mountain region. Results indicated that fire boundary formation was strongly influenced by non-fuels, alpine and subalpine vegetation, wetland areas, and low and sparse shrub assemblages generally associated with avalanche paths. Fire cessation was more likely near waterways; however, the fire weather conditions that characterized most burning periods likely overrode other topographic influences. Fire cessation was most likely to occur one day following precipitation events when Vapour Pressure Deficit and Fire Weather Index values decreased. To explore the potential influence of spatial data resolution and fire mapping limitations on our results, we varied the distance between matched sample points selected on each side of the mapped fire perimeter during statistical modelling. Results demonstrated matched pairs of burned and unburned sample points were effective at representing discrete states when separated by at least 100 m and that insufficient or excessive separation between matched pairs confounds results, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analysis for determining the appropriate separation distance to represent burned and unburned states. We demonstrate a practical application of the model to predict spread potential, enabling rapid visual assessment of landscape locations most likely to limit fire spread.","","article","","506","","","Modelling fire perimeter formation in the Canadian Rocky Mountains","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112721010513","0378-1127","2022","119958","Forest Ecology and Management"

Thus dispersants can reduce the probability of oil slicks at sea from reaching coastal regions and reduce their direct impact on mammals, sea birds and shoreline ecosystems. To facilitate marine oil spill response operations, especially addressing spill incidents in remote/Arctic offshore regions, an in-depth understanding of the transportation, fate and effects of naturally/chemically dispersed oil is of great importance.

Both scattering and absorption coefficients for PM1 and PM10 particles maximized in the southern Red Sea, due to continental outflow from East Africa, and in the Arabian/Persian Gulf due to enhanced anthropogenic/industrial emissions, leading to 3-fold sulfate concentrations compared to the other regions. The East Mediterranean exhibited moderate aerosol loading, with high scattering Ångström Exponent (SAE) values (1.98, 1.30 for PM1 and PM10, respectively), which increased in the Suez Canal and the Arabian Gulf due to impact from combustion sources. The aerosol over the Gulf of Aden and the West Arabian Sea was dominated by coarse particles (SAE<1), with higher Ca2+ concentrations (dust influence). The absorption Ångström Exponent (AAE) remained close to 1, indicative of black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel combustion, while it increased in regions dominated by dust (Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea). Contrasting aerosol types were identified between the sub-regions using the SAE vs. AAE classification scheme. The “BC-dominated” type prevailed over the East Mediterranean and Suez Canal, while dust mixtures dominated in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Over the Arabian Gulf, mixing of anthropogenic pollution with marine aerosols formed a type with fine particles and low spectral dependence of absorption (AAE<1).

According to the concept of vegetation-atmosphere coupling factor, Ω, introduced by Jarvis and McNaughton (1986), an expression based upon the vegetation parameterization currently used in the mesoscale model, is derived. The new definition of the coupling factor includes a sensitivity to the vegetation cover, radiative emissivity and stem/leaf area index ratio. A numerical simulation was performed for the case of 16 June 1986 of the HAPEX-MOBILHY experiment, in which both aerodynamic and canopy conductances are interactively simulated according to the radiative and atmospheric forcings. The results show very contrasted behaviour between the forest and the agricultural crops. Over the forest, where Ω < 0.1, the transpiration rate is mainly controlled by leaf stomatal activity, while over the crops where 0.2 < Ω < 0.3, the reduced net radiative energy supply limits the transpiration rate.

The results show the following changes in aeolian fluxes (dust and sand) over time: 7800–4150 cal. yr BP – generally low dust fluxes with a periodic intensification of sand fluxes; 4150–2300 cal. yr BP – intense deposition of both dust and sand; 2300–150 cal. yr BP – fluctuating dust and sand fluxes; the last 200 years – the highest amplitude of both sand and dust fluxes.

Internal and external indicators were identified to highlight the port States at risk of becoming exposed to IUU fishing transactions. This paper includes an analysis of designated port use, a key requirement of PSMA implementation. The paper also establishes an ongoing methodological framework for port associated IUU risk assessment using the outputs as a benchmark against which follow-up trend analyses are planned, the next using 2023 data. Port rankings evolved because of continued AIS adoption, port State business diversification and Covid-19 related disruptions. 3% of commercial port calls globally are made by foreign vessels. Globally, internal port State risk has dropped, while external risk has increased, the former driven by parties to the PSMA, and the latter by PSMA non-parties. Higher-risk fleets are now diverting to PSMA non-parties. The findings underline the transformational nature of the Agreement. Overall port State risk correlates more strongly with quality of governance than with national income.

Through their metabolic activities they directly and indirectly link element cycles. This leads to the cycling of elements through the Earth’s ecosystems from/to the atmosphere to/from the lithosphere. Gold (Au) is a rare, redox-active, noble transition metal, which is neither essential as a nutrient nor, reputedly, mobile in the environment. Therefore, observations published in recent decades, which have shown that gold is highly mobile and subject to biogeochemical cycling largely driven by microbiota, have surprised many. Questions concerning the fundamental biogeochemical processes mediating gold cycling, the organisms involved and the benefits they may gain have puzzled researchers. In this review we integrate the cycling of the major biogenic elements carbon, nitrogen and sulfur with that of gold. We identify key-processes that drive gold cycling and evaluate how different chemical Au(I/III)-species affect microbiota that form biofilms on gold-bearing minerals and placer gold particles. Additionally, we assess how the cycling of the gold-associated metal(loid)s silver, copper, iron, manganese, mercury and arsenic is linked to that of gold. Microbially produced compounds resulting from carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, iron and manganese cycling (e.g., organic acids, cyanides, (thio)sulfates, ammonium, iron sulfides/oxy-hydroxides and managanese oxides) can each play important roles for the mobilization of gold. Highly toxic, mobile Au(I/III)-complexes affect the phylogenetic and functional composition of microbial communities resident on gold particles. This leads to gold detoxification coupled to active and passive biomineralization, and ultimately the aggregation and (trans)formation of metallic gold particles. The complex interplay between gold, microbiota and physicochemical conditions modified by these organisms (e.g., redox or pH) has throughout the Earth’s history led to the aggregation of gold particles (grains to nuggets), led to the formation of the largest known gold deposit (i.e., Witwatersrand paleo-placer), and the largest gold reservoir in seawater. Today it opens up exciting biotechnological pathways for mineral exploration, processing and remediation.","","article","","190","","","Cycling of biogenic elements drives biogeochemical gold cycling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825218305920","0012-8252","2019","131-147","Earth-Science Reviews"

High spatial resolution measurements of trace elements (Sr, Ba and Mg) were done by Laser-Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Trace elements profiles were interpreted as environmental and climate changes in the Han-sur-Lesse region. Power spectrum estimators and continuous wavelet transform were applied on trace elements time series to detect any statistically significant periodicities in the PN stalagmite. Spectral analyses reveal decadal to millennial periodicities (i.e., 68–75, 133–136, 198–209, 291–358, 404–602, 912–1029 and 2365–2670 yr) in the speleothem record. Results were compared to reconstructed sunspot number data to determine whether solar signal is presents in PN speleothem. The occurrence of significant solar periodicities (i.e., cycles of Gleissberg, de Vries, unnamed 500 years, Eddy and Hallstatt) supports for an impact of solar forcing on PN speleothem trace element contents. Moreover, several intervals of significant rapid winter change were detected during the Holocene at 10.3, 9.3–9.5, around 8.2, 6.4–6.2, 4.7–4.5, and around 2.7 ka BP. Those intervals are similar to the cold winter events evidenced in different natural paleoclimate archives, suggesting common climate forcing mechanisms related to changes in solar irradiance.","","article","","192","","","Evidence for solar influence in a Holocene speleothem record (Père Noël cave, SE Belgium)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118302038","0277-3791","2018","249-262","Quaternary Science Reviews"

By studying the conditions under which carbon is stable as diamond, a new regional geophysical exploration philosophy is espoused based upon the search for lithospheric conditions favorable to diamond genesis and preservation. Surface heat flow values of less than 40–45 mW m−2 and lithospheric thicknesses of greater than 150 km meet these target conditions. An analysis of two-dimensional thermal heterogeneities in the lithosphere indicates that target areas should have low surface heat flow over an areas of at least 300 to 400 km diameter. In addition to having low surface heat flow, such target regions are likely to be characterized by a large depth to the Curie Point isotherm, relatively great depths to lithospheric electrical conductors, slow seismic velocities, and great depths to the seismic low velocity zone. The region is likely to be characterized by a paucity of seismicity with high maximum hypocentral depths. The primary problem with these techniques in regional diamond exploration is that they provide information about modern lithospheric structure. Changes in lithospheric structure through time may be detected as elevation changes. These conditions are most commonly found in regions of Archean and Early Proterozoic lithosphere, and are consistent with Clifford's Rule, an empirical diamond exploration strategy. The restriction of these conditions to these ancient terrains may be associated with special conditions required to form these terrains which only existed early in Earth history, or with an increase in the thermal heterogeneity of the lithosphere through time which results in, on average, thinner lithosphere in younger terrains.","","article","","53","","","Diamond exploration from the bottom up: regional geophysical signatures of lithosphere conditions favorable for diamond exploration","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037567429400072J","0375-6742","1995","145-165","Journal of Geochemical Exploration"

Deconvolving natural and anthropogenic changes to water quality is hampered by the lack of long term, dated water quality data but such records are required for forward modelling of reef health to aid their management. Reef corals provide an excellent archive of high resolution geochemical (trace element) proxies that can span hundreds of years and potentially provide records used through the Holocene. Hence, geochemical proxies in corals hold great promise for understanding changes in ancient water quality that can inform broader oceanographic and climatic changes in a given region. This article reviews and highlights the use of coral-based trace metal archives, including metal transported from rivers to the ocean, incorporation of trace metals into coral skeletons and the current ‘state of the art’ in utilizing coral trace metal proxies as tools for monitoring various types of local and regional source-specific pollution (river discharge, land use changes, dredging and dumping, mining, oil spills, antifouling paints, atmospheric sources, sewage). The three most commonly used coral trace element proxies (i.e., Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, and Y/Ca) are closely associated with river runoff in the Great Barrier Reef, but considerable uncertainty remains regarding their complex biogeochemical cycling and controlling mechanisms. However, coral-based water quality reconstructions have suffered from a lack of understanding of so-called vital effects and early marine diagenesis. The main challenge is to identify and eliminate the influence of extraneous local factors in order to allow accurate water quality reconstructions and to develop alternate proxies to monitor water pollution. Rare earth elements have great potential as they are self-referencing and reflect basic terrestrial input.","","article","","566-567","","","Coral skeletal geochemistry as a monitor of inshore water quality","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716309962","0048-9697","2016","652-684","Science of The Total Environment"

A need for systematic assessment of riverine habitats is thus well-documented. Riparian zones are especially important due to the large array of ecosystem and social services they can provide, while also recently gaining a major role in the new European biodiversity policy. In this context, the necessity to gather spatial information on extent, distribution and characteristics of the riparian zones is clear. This paper presents the development of a novel model to derive geographical distribution and basic characteristics of stream riparian zones in Europe, including both river-floodplain systems and the riparian networks of minor and ephemeral streams. A series of relevant descriptive attributes (water boundary, vegetation presence, land-cover, upland boundary and local geomorphology) is initially selected from the existing literature to describe the presence of riparian zones. Spatially explicit estimates of these attributes are obtained using available Earth Observation data and pan-European thematic datasets. Finally, the information layers are combined through an aggregation system that assigns a degree of belonging to the riparian zone class using two fuzzy membership functions to evaluate water influence and presence of natural vegetation, respectively. Riparian zones with no hydrological connection are also incorporated in by the model based on functional considerations. The distribution of stream riparian zones was derived and mapped for the whole of Europe at fine resolution. Modelled riparian zones extend for approximately 91,000km2, considering the entire range of low to high membership to the riparian class. A characterization of land-cover types was derived based on Corine Land Cover 2000 data, showing that European riparian zones are strongly dominated by forest habitats. Accuracy assessment was performed using independent ecological datasets and visual validation, indicating that producer accuracy is equal to 84.5±1.3% and user accuracy to 72.6±5.8% at 95% confidence level. The proposed model and output can represent valuable information for large-scale research activities of riparian environments and to support national and supra-national conservation programmes.","","article","","24","","","Pan-European distribution modelling of stream riparian zones based on multi-source Earth Observation data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X12002336","1470-160X","2013","211-223","Ecological Indicators"

As part of a NAVAIR High Strength Steel Corrosion–Fatigue Assessment Program, methods were studied to predict the impact that corrosion-induced surface roughness has on the fatigue life of high-strength steel aircraft components. In order to adequately capture the corrosion damage features that cause fatigue cracking, a representative set of well-characterized corrosion–fatigue test results were generated to be used for model development. The test specimens fabricated for this program consisted of bare, unnotched AF1410 steel flat plates with a 25.4mm diameter corrosion patch on one side. Two sets of test specimens were fabricated and tested, with one set abrasive blasted after heat treatment, and the other set hand polished after heat treatment. A method of growing corrosion in the laboratory was developed that consisted of filter paper soaked in a 3.5% NaCl solution and placed at the center of the test plate gage section, with a voltage applied across the filter paper to accelerate corrosion growth. High-resolution 3D surface topography data was collected from the corroded region on each test plate prior to fatigue testing using a commercial white-light interference microscope. Constant-amplitude fatigue tests were performed on corroded and uncorroded test plates at several different stress levels, for three different corrosion exposure levels. Post-test fractographic analysis of the corroded specimens indicate that all of the critical cracks originated from small corrosion notches on the order of 10–200μm in width, 10–120μm in height and 2–100μm in depth. These notches were not considered to be pits in that the depth dimension was less than the surface dimensions. The repeatability of the fatigue initiating mechanism for corrosion damaged surfaces in this material indicates that it should be possible to develop a single modeling approach that reasonably captures the effects of corrosion notches in reducing fatigue life.","","article","","31","","","Fatigue life prediction of corrosion-damaged high-strength steel using an equivalent stress riser (ESR) model: Part I: Test development and results","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142112309001832","0142-1123","2009","1454-1463","International Journal of Fatigue"

Classifications of the weather conditions prevailing at large continental scales (called “Synoptic Weather Types”, SWT) offer convenient potential proxies for integrating weather-related factors into our understanding of fire regime attributes at regional scales. Here we establish a methodology for identifying the major SWT that lead to wildfires and assessing their influence on fire regime in interaction with other global drivers such as drought events or fire suppression policies. Based on days with fires larger than 50 ha that occurred in Catalonia, a region located in the western Mediterranean Basin, we propose a clustering methodology using data of temperature at 850 hPa, sea level pressure and winds at 925 hPa from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset covering the whole of western Europe (25–70°N and 20°W–40°E). Our classification method proposes 6 SWT: three that were characterized by synoptic conditions leading to strong winds in the region, two that led to ‘hot and dry’ environments, and one that was not characterized by any strong weather determinants. Fires under ‘hot and dry’ conditions, such as the South intrusion SWT, triggered the bulk of fires and burnt area in the region. Spatial analyses of fire distribution under each SWT revealed markedly different fire-prone locations, opening the possibility for strategic planning of fire management based on local fire regimes. Fires occurring during mild years (wet spring conditions) and under ‘hot-and-dry’ SWTs have been eradicated from the region thanks to enhanced firefighting capability, and fire sizes in dry years have strongly reduced. In contrast, fires occurring under windy situations have not followed the same course of change and have not diminished in incidence over time, and seem to be more difficult to control using current fire suppression strategies. The role of SWT on determining fire regimes and its interaction with fire suppression strategies has a huge potential to help researchers and managers develop better fire analyses based on sound physical grounds and serve to understand and eventually regulate the adverse impacts of fire regime changes in a global change context.","","article","","253-254","","","Synoptic weather conditions and changing fire regimes in a Mediterranean environment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318300649","0168-1923","2018","190-202","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

Hazards, risks, and disasters related to snow and ice not only result from direct impacts on humans and their infrastructure by, for instance, snow avalanches, floods from glacial lakes, or accelerated erosion of permafrost coasts, but they are also a consequence of the expansion of human activities into previously avoided dangerous regions, such as new shipping routes in the polar ocean, or tourist installations in cold mountains that are becoming ice-free. The loss of goods and benefits from reducing or even vanishing cryosphere components constitutes serious hazards to human well-being through, for example, diminishing meltwater supply in high-mountain rivers during dry seasons or rising global sea level.

All studies have critically been reviewed and integrated with original data, spanning from proximal to ultradistal findings of the 79 CE eruption products throughout the Mediterranean. The work not only combines different investigation approaches (stratigraphic, petrological, geophysical, modelling), but also follows temporally the 79 CE eruptive and depositional events, from the magma chamber to the most distal tephras. This has allowed us first to compile a full database of all findings of those deposits, then to relate the products (the deposits) to the genetic thermomechanical processes (the eruption), and lastly to better assess both the local and regional impacts of the 79 CE eruption in the environment. This information leads to a number of open issues (e.g., regional environmental impact vs. local pyroclastic current impact) that are worthy of further investigations, although the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius is one of the best studied eruptions in volcanology. The structure of the work follows three macro-categories, the historical aspects, the products, and the processes of the 79 CE eruption. For each investigation approach (from stratigraphy to modelling), all dedicated studies and original data are discussed. The open issues are then synthesized in the discussion under a global view of Plinian eruptions, from the magma setting to its dispersion as pyroclasts flowing on the surface vs. falling from the volcanic plume. In this way, a lesson from the past, in particular from the well-studied 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius, will be of help for a better synchronization of processes and products in future developments. Lastly, various aspects for volcanic hazard assessment of Plinian eruptions are highlighted from the tephra distribution and modelling points of view, as these large natural phenomena can have a larger impact than previously thought, also at other active volcanoes.","","article","","231","","","The 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius: A lesson from the past and the need of a multidisciplinary approach for developments in volcanology","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825222001568","0012-8252","2022","104072","Earth-Science Reviews"

Several existing reliable routing protocols exploit message broadcast redundancy and hop count as routing metrics and their performance trade-offs are revealed during simulation. In this paper, we study and analyse related design issues in proposed efficient and reliable routing protocols that attempt to achieve reliable and efficient communication performance in both single- and multi-hub sensor networks. Simulation results of four such routing protocols show that routing performance depends more on optimal (near-optimal) routing in single hub than in multi-hub networks.

Maximum entropy spectral analysis reveals three periodicities, a dominant one at about 300 m.y. and others, less well-defined, at 113 and 57 m.y. The variations in polarity bias are compared with the paleosecular variation, and it is shown that the magnitude of the paleosecular variation is greater in disturbed than in quiet intervals. This indicates that the magnitude of paleosecular variation and polarity bias are governed by variations in the balance between non-dipole and dipole components of the field, and that these variations probably had their origin in processes near the core—mantle interface. The correspondence between the dominant periods of 300 m.y. and plate tectonics is noted and a causal relationship suggested.","","article","","12","","","Reversals of the geomagnetic field, magnetostratigraphy, and relative magnitude of paleosecular variation in the phanerozoic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012825276900532","0012-8252","1976","35-64","Earth-Science Reviews"

From ∼2.6 to ∼1.0Ma ago, ice sheets came and went about every 41ka, in pace with cycles in the tilt of Earth’s axis, but for the past 700ka, glacial cycles have been longer, lasting ∼100ka, separated by brief, warm interglaciations, when sea level and ice volumes were close to present. The cause of the shift from 41ka to 100ka glacial cycles is still debated. During the penultimate interglaciation, ∼130 to ∼120ka ago, solar energy in summer in the Arctic was greater than at any time subsequently. As a consequence, Arctic summers were ∼5°C warmer than at present, and almost all glaciers melted completely except for the Greenland Ice Sheet, and even it was reduced in size substantially from its present extent. With the loss of land ice, sea level was about 5m higher than present, with the extra melt coming from both Greenland and Antarctica as well as small glaciers. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) peaked ∼21ka ago, when mean annual temperatures over parts of the Arctic were as much as 20°C lower than at present. Ice recession was well underway 16ka ago, and most of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets had melted by 6ka ago. Solar energy reached a summer maximum (9% higher than at present) ∼11ka ago and has been decreasing since then, primarily in response to the precession of the equinoxes. The extra energy elevated early Holocene summer temperatures throughout the Arctic 1–3°C above 20th century averages, enough to completely melt many small glaciers throughout the Arctic, although the Greenland Ice Sheet was only slightly smaller than at present. Early Holocene summer sea ice limits were substantially smaller than their 20th century average, and the flow of Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean was substantially greater. As summer solar energy decreased in the second half of the Holocene, glaciers re-established or advanced, sea ice expanded, and the flow of warm Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean diminished. Late Holocene cooling reached its nadir during the Little Ice Age (about 1250–1850 AD), when sun-blocking volcanic eruptions and perhaps other causes added to the orbital cooling, allowing most Arctic glaciers to reach their maximum Holocene extent. During the warming of the past century, glaciers have receded throughout the Arctic, terrestrial ecosystems have advanced northward, and perennial Arctic Ocean sea ice has diminished. Here we review the proxies that allow reconstruction of Quaternary climates and the feedbacks that amplify climate change across the Arctic. We provide an overview of the evolution of climate from the hot-house of the early Cenozoic through its transition to the ice-house of the Quaternary, with special emphasis on the anomalous warmth of the middle Pliocene, early Quaternary warm times, the Mid Pleistocene transition, warm interglaciations of marine isotope stages 11, 5e, and 1, the stage 3 interstadial, and the peak cold of the last glacial maximum.","","article","","29","","","Temperature and precipitation history of the Arctic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379110000673","0277-3791","2010","1679-1715","Quaternary Science Reviews"

The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18°21′S, 24°00′S) during the period 1990–2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14cm (medium class) and longer than 14cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August–September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment.","","article","","164","","","Influence of climate variability on anchovy reproductive timing off northern Chile","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092479631630241X","0924-7963","2016","67-75","Journal of Marine Systems"

They are encountered in sediment of both the continental margins and the permafrost region; areas considered to host amongst the most climate-sensitive ecosystems on Earth. With worldwide temperature increases affecting continental margins and the permafrost, it is important to raise concern about the fate of the NGHD in the coming centuries. Thus, this review presents an overview of the potential consequences of hydrate decomposition on its surrounding areas. It compiles and discusses hydrate-derived methane fluxes measured or inferred from in situ data at several sites by considering both dissociation and dissolution. Depending on the magnitude and the duration of hydrate decomposition, the amounts of methane released can affect to varying degrees the seafloor and the microbial communities that sustain the methane cycle and regulate its transfer from the sediment to the water column; and that aspect is addressed in this review. Here, we also considered the transfer of methane from NGHDs and more broadly from marine emissions to the atmosphere, as it is assumed that such transfer will likely increase in the future. Finally, multi-scale monitoring in space and time is a key element to evaluate the impacts of natural and anthropic perturbations on NGHDs. We thus propose potential engineering solutions for the monitoring of NGHD, mainly based on the long-term deployment of sensor systems.","","article","","","","","Environmental challenges related to methane hydrate decomposition from climate change scenario and anthropic activities: State of the art, potential consequences and monitoring solutions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825223002672","0012-8252","2023","104578","Earth-Science Reviews"

In the marine realm, environmental variability can lead to the development of temporary periods of anomalous oceanographic conditions that can connect individuals to areas of habitat outside a population's usual range, or alternatively, restrict individuals from areas usually within their range, thus acting as ecological bridges or ecological barriers. These temporary features can result in novel or irregular trophic interactions and changes in population spatial dynamics, and, therefore, may have significant implications for management of marine ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence of ecological bridges and barriers in different ocean regions, drawing upon five case studies in which particular oceanographic conditions have facilitated or restricted the movements of individuals from highly migratory species. We discuss the potential population-level significance of ecological bridges and barriers, with respect to the life history characteristics of different species, and inter- and intra-population variability in habitat use. Finally, we summarize the persistence of bridge dynamics with time, our ability to monitor bridges and barriers in a changing climate, and implications for forecasting future climate-mediated ecosystem change.","","article","","140","","","Ecological bridges and barriers in pelagic ecosystems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064516303290","0967-0645","2017","182-192","Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography"

Although the probability of occurrence of natural disasters has nothing to do with political borders, crisis preparedness and postdisaster relief and reconstruction tend to be less effective in cross-border areas than elsewhere.

The predominant tendency of continued worldwide glacier shrinkage indeed constitutes one of the clearest indications in nature of rapid climate change at a global scale. The observed trend of increasingly negative mass balances is consistent with an accelerated trend in global warming and correspondingly enhanced energy flux toward the earth surface. Mountain ranges at lower latitudes have lost large percentages of their glacier areas and volumes since the end of the Little Ice Age. Many of them may become mostly or even completely de-glaciated during the coming decades. Such changes have the potential to profoundly affect environmental conditions far beyond cold mountain chains. Sea-level rise, shifting seasonality in water supply, and local formation of new lakes reflect changes in the water cycle at global, continental, and regional-to-local scales. They are accompanied by rather marked changes in cold-mountain landscape appearance, slope stability, erosion/sedimentation, and hazard conditions. Worldwide monitoring of glaciers today involves process-oriented field measurements, high-resolution geodetic information from space and new terrestrial technologies, but also faces difficult challenges of vanishing glaciers with long-term mass-balance observations. Combining rich observational data with spatio-temporal modeling increasingly helps to prepare integrated analyses of observed phenomena and with anticipating likely future developments as a basis for the planning and realization of climate adaptation strategies.

Similarly, exponential growth in the development of different data analysis approaches has been reported in the literature, amongst which the K-means algorithm remains the most popular and straightforward clustering algorithm. The broad applicability of the algorithm in many clustering application areas can be attributed to its implementation simplicity and low computational complexity. However, the K-means algorithm has many challenges that negatively affect its clustering performance. In the algorithm’s initialization process, users must specify the number of clusters in a given dataset apriori while the initial cluster centers are randomly selected. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is susceptible to the selection of this initial cluster and for large datasets, determining the optimal number of clusters to start with becomes complex and is a very challenging task. Moreover, the random selection of the initial cluster centers sometimes results in minimal local convergence due to its greedy nature. A further limitation is that certain data object features are used in determining their similarity by using the Euclidean distance metric as a similarity measure, but this limits the algorithm’s robustness in detecting other cluster shapes and poses a great challenge in detecting overlapping clusters. Many research efforts have been conducted and reported in literature with regard to improving the K-means algorithm’s performance and robustness. The current work presents an overview and taxonomy of the K-means clustering algorithm and its variants.

Long-term, well-calibrated, global observations of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as air temperature, precipitation, and sea-surface temperature are critical for defining the evolving state of the Earth's climate. Observing systems routinely collect much of the required data covering 49 ECVs, and significant progress has been made in coverage and technological capability over the two decades since the Second World Climate Conference. However, many key regions and climatic zones remain poorly observed, and gaps are widening in some cases. Supporting infrastructures for data stewardship and analysis are largely in place but require strengthening, while those for linking with socio-economic data and for providing user-oriented information services require more substantial development. The current capabilities are summarized, and further actions are identified to ensure that climate observation activities more fully meet the needs of science and society. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established in 1992 with the goal of providing comprehensive information on the total climate system, involving a multidisciplinary range of physical, chemical and biological observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land. GCOS is a “system of systems” that builds on the climate-relevant components of existing observing systems, and relies almost entirely upon national efforts to maintain and enhance those systems. Contributing systems include the World Meteorological Organization Global Observing System (GOS) for meteorology, its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) for atmospheric composition, the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). GCOS itself is the climate observing system within the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) developed under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). The established in situ networks and space-based components must be sustained and operated with ongoing attention to data quality in accordance with the GCOS Climate Monitoring Principles; enhancements must be made for some types of observations; the exchange of observations and delivery of data and information to users must be ensured; reprocessing and reanalysis must be strengthened; and national and international coordination must be improved. The consequence of not meeting these requirements would be to seriously compromise the information on, and predictions of, climate variability and change. Detailed information on GCOS and the datasets that are produced as a result of GCOS observing activities can be found at the Global Observing Systems Information Center (GOSIC) at http://gosic.org.","","article","","1","","","Observation Needs for Climate Information, Prediction and Application: Capabilities of Existing and Future Observing Systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029610000149","1878-0296","2010","192-205","Procedia Environmental Sciences"

However, it is a difficult problem to directly model the spatio-temporal variations of trajectories due to their high dimensionality and nonlinearity. In this paper, we propose a joint trajectory tracking and recognition algorithm by combining a generative model derived from a bi-directional deep neural network (called “autoencoder”) into a Bayesian estimation framework. The “autoencoder” network embeds high-dimensional trajectories into a two-dimensional plane based on a peculiar training rule and learns a trajectory generative model by its inverse mapping. A set of plausible trajectories can be generated by the trajectory generative model. In the tracking process, the samples from the plausible trajectory set are weighted by a mixed likelihood and are resampled to obtain the target state estimation at each time step in spirit of the particle filtering. The trajectory identity is inferred by evaluating the improved Hausdorff distance between the estimated trajectory up to now and the truncated reference trajectories. Moreover, the trajectory recognition results are also used to guide the trajectory tracking for the next time. The experiments on tracking and recognizing handwritten digits show that the proposed approach can achieve both robust tracking and exact recognition in background clutter and partial occlusion.","","article","","27","","","Joint trajectory tracking and recognition based on bi-directional nonlinear learning","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885608002503","0262-8856","2009","1302-1312","Image and Vision Computing"

The most widely used solution takes up the modular framework for sensing and information processing such as perception, mapping, control, planning and decision making. However, this approach misses the capability of environmental understanding. Hence, to achieve full autonomy in navigation a computing model with self-learning capability inspired by biological intelligence such as memorizing, inferring and experience update is essential for dynamic and noisy environments. Recent advanced sensing, communication and hardware miniaturization technologies achieved few autonomous operations in commercial systems but the full autonomy has not been attained yet. In this paper, the effect of precise and accurate localization for autonomous navigation technologies is extensively studied and the problems and limitations of the related algorithms are analyzed. The major limitations for precise localization are computational complexity, sensor noise and communication delays. These limitations further reduce perception and planning capabilities of autonomous navigation systems. From this study, the future prospects are outlined to achieve a higher level of autonomy by precise localization.","","article","","160","","","Precise localization for achieving next-generation autonomous navigation: State-of-the-art, taxonomy and future prospects","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366420303935","0140-3664","2020","351-374","Computer Communications"

Additively manufactured UHSSs have a unique microstructure that provides significant potential to achieve good mechanical properties. This paper reviews the latest research progress in the additive manufacturing (AM) of UHSSs with a special focus on defect optimization, microstructure-property regulation and the application of advanced assisted techniques for additively manufactured UHSSs. The property origin of UHSSs is firstly summarized in detail, including the influence of different alloying elements and phase composition in the microstructure on the mechanical properties of UHSSs. The AM techniques used to fabricate UHSSs and the characteristics of their forming microstructure are further illustrated, which involve laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), laser direct energy deposition (L-DED), and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The research progress on the three typical techniques for UHSSs is also reviewed. Moreover, the property regulation methodology of UHSSs is reviewed, mainly in the optimization of defects and the adjustment of the whole forming process. Significantly, the shortcomings of the present researches on AMed UHSSs and future challenges for development are discussed. This work is important for a better scientific understanding of AMed UHSSs and provides vital meaningful guidelines for the future work in UHSSs manufacturing.","","article","","965","","","Additive manufacturing of ultra-high strength steels: A review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838823026932","0925-8388","2023","171390","Journal of Alloys and Compounds"

However, these schemes have only been evaluated based on point-to-point communication metrics and do not consider the different underwater propagation phenomena. On the other hand, the unique properties of UWSNs such as the three-dimensional architecture and the underwater channel characteristics prevent existing studies of error control schemes for terrestrial sensor networks to be applied to this domain. In this paper, a cross-layer analysis framework is developed to evaluate existing error control techniques in three-dimensional multi-hop UWSNs. The developed framework captures the effects of automatic repeat request (ARQ), forward error correction (FEC), and hybrid ARQ schemes on end-to-end energy, latency, and packet error rate. In addition, different underwater propagation phenomena are considered with a particular attention on the presence of shadow zones. The theoretical analysis and the numerical evaluations reveal that exploiting FEC schemes with channel-aware routing reduces the end-to-end energy consumption and latency under all propagation phenomena for all water depths in UWSNs. The selection of the suitable error control scheme depends also on the water depth (shallow/deep water) and on the different underwater propagation phenomena.","","article","","35","","","Cross-layer analysis of error control in underwater wireless sensor networks","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366412002514","0140-3664","2012","2162-2172","Computer Communications"

Historical events provoked much interest, and sometimes alarm, because bright aurora becomes visible at mid-latitudes. However, they had little economic impact because the major technologies of those eras were not sensitive to space weather. This is no longer true. The widespread adoption of advanced technological infrastructures over the past 40years has created significant sensitivity. So these events now have the potential to disrupt those infrastructures – and thus have profound economic and societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such events are rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of the events. This limitation is uniquely serious for space weather since it is a global phenomenon. Many other natural hazards (e.g. flash floods) are highly localised, so statistically significant datasets can be assembled by combining data from independent instances of the hazard recorded over a few decades. Such datasets are the foundation on which reliable risk assessment methodologies are built. But we have a single instance of space weather so we would have to make observations for many centuries in order to build a statistically significant dataset. We show that it is not practicable to assess the risk from extreme events using simple statistical methods. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of solar-terrestrial physics to find other ways to assess these risks. We discuss three alternative approaches: (a) use of proxy data, (b) studies of other solar systems, and (c) use of physics-based modelling. We note that the proxy data approach is already well-established as a technique for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not yet provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms. This latter risk is more suited to the other approaches, but significant research is needed to make progress. We need to develop and expand techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar systems (stellar flares, radio emissions from planetary aurorae). And to make progress in modelling severe space weather, we need to focus on the physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e.g. how can dayside and tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to envelop mid-latitudes?","","article","","47","","","Towards a scientific understanding of the risk from extreme space weather","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117710001122","0273-1177","2011","2059-2072","Advances in Space Research"

However, green and purple sulfur bacteria can also occur in microbial mats. In this study we present a basin-scale assessment of biomarkers associated with open water column PZE and/or microbialites. The lithofacies from the Early Triassic of the northern part of the northern Perth Basin consist of dark coloured mudstones (black to dark grey) with microbialites, which were deposited away from basin margins. These samples are found to contain okenane, chlorobactane and isorenieratane derived from carotenoid pigments of purple, green-green and green–brown sulfur bacteria, respectively. These biomarkers are not observed in the light coloured mudstones (medium grey) formed under oxic conditions in a tidal environment with higher clastic input close to the basin margins in the southern part of the basin where shallow marine sandstones were also deposited. Okenane and chlorobactane were abundant in facies containing microbialites which developed in a shallow water setting on intra-basinal structural highs. The development of oxic conditions near the basin margins in the Perth Basin provided refuges for organisms during the end Permian mass extinction event. Okenane was more abundant in the microbialite facies compared with the dark coloured mudstones deposited under PZE. C33 n-alkylcyclohexane (n-C33 ACH) has previously been described as a biomarker associated with ecosystem collapse during the lower Triassic, and its ratio relative to the C34 n-alkane was elevated in facies that contain abundant microbialites. Mercury (Hg) to total reduced inorganic sulfur (TRIS) and Hg to total organic carbon (TOC) ratios are positively correlated, supporting the development of euxinia as sulfide sequesters Hg. The high Hg/TRIS values in microbialite facies support mat development with high Hg concentrations. The values of δ13COM and δ34S were isotopically lighter in microbialite facies when compared with mudstones formed under PZE, although samples deposited under oxic conditions showed the isotopically lightest δ13COM and isotopically heaviest δ34S. The variation in δ13COM probably reflects the different carbon fixation pathway of various sulfur bacteria, while it appears that the difference of δ34S values between PZE and microbialites is a result of differences in the microbial community structure and the higher relative abundance of purple sulfur bacteria. In addition, fluctuations between PZE and oxic conditions were identified throughout the sampled intervals attributed to fluctuations in the depth of chemocline. Under the shallower chemocline, PZE developed widely in the basin, even in shallower waters. Under the deeper chemocline PZE was absent or limited to deeper water, and oxic conditions developed in shallower water. The fluctuations of PZE and oxic conditions in the northern Perth Basin suggest the development of multiple episodes of harsh environmental conditions after the end-Permian mass extinction, similar to those identified in other regions (e.g., Meishan in China and Peace River in Canada).","","article","","336","","","Photic zone redox oscillations and microbialite development recorded by Early Triassic sediments of the Perth Basin: A geochemical approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703722004860","0016-7037","2022","188-207","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

Model solutions suggest that during the eastward drift across the North Pacific the debris became “stratified” by the wind so that objects with different windages took different paths: high windage items reached North America in large numbers the first year, medium windage items recirculated southwest toward Hawaii and Asia, and low windage items collected in the Subtropical Gyre, primarily in the so-called “garbage patch” area located northeast of Hawaii and known for high concentrations of microplastics. Numerous boats lost during the tsunami were later observed at sea and/or found on the west coast of North America: these observations are used to determine optimal windage values for scaling the model solutions.

Indeed, after developing the Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis, the results obtained for the plant under investigation are elaborated through Machine Learning techniques such as the Association Rule Mining to define the cause-effect relationships that led to a failure. The association rules extracted are then processed through the Social Network Analysis to represent such relationships, facilitate their comprehension, and identify the existence of communities of nodes to detect critical patterns and locate the most influential nodes. The knowledge of such details can provide helpful support in terms of awareness of the plant and the development of intelligent maintenance procedures.

Here, we monitor natural environmental stress by the occurrence of morphologically abnormal planktonic foraminiferal specimens from a suite of surface sediments in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We also compare Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) abnormality observations from sapropel S1-derived sediments in the Aegean, Libyan and Levantine basins, since they provide a direct record of a natural stress experiment that took place over past time scales. At initial sapropel deposition levels, we observe increased growth asymmetry in Globigerinoides ruber twinned and twisted individuals, possibly associated with eutrophication and anoxia. In modern material, a range of malformations and aberrant morphologies from slight deformity with smaller or overdeveloped chambers to more severe deformity with abnormally protruding or misplaced chambers, distorted spirals, and double tests is also observed, as a result of the hypersaline, oligotrophic and oxygen-depleted nature of the Mediterranean Sea water column. Overall, we highlight the current use of the relative abundance of abnormal tests as a bio-indicator for monitoring natural stress, especially the occurrence of twin specimens as indicative of high-salinity stress conditions, and further illustrate the necessity to map both their spatial and temporal distribution for accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Such an approach presents the advantage to rapidly provide information over wide spatial and temporal scales, extending our ability to monitor a wide variety of environments (from coastal to the open-sea). However, further investigations should extend this approach to test the robustness of our findings in a number of similar oceanic settings.","","article","","181","","","Planktonic foraminiferal abnormalities in coastal and open marine eastern Mediterranean environments: A natural stress monitoring approach in recent and early Holocene marine systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796317303202","0924-7963","2018","63-78","Journal of Marine Systems"

In this study we examine how annual area burned (BA) in the Portuguese public forest varied in relation to environmental and human-influenced drivers during the 1943–2011 period. Fire behaviour models were used to describe fuel hazard considering biomass removal, cover type changes, area burned, post-disturbance fuel accumulation, forest age-classes distribution and fuel connectivity. Biomass removal decreased rapidly beyond the 1940s, which, along with afforestation, increased fuel hazard until the 1980s; a subsequent decline was caused by increased fire activity. Change point analysis indicates upward shifts in BA in 1952 and in 1973, both corresponding to six-fold increases. Fire weather (expressed by the 90th percentile of the Canadian FWI during summer) increased over the study period, accounting for 18 and 36% of log(BA) variation before 1974 and after 1973, respectively. Regression modelling indicates that BA responds positively to fire weather, fuel hazard and number of fires in descending order of importance; pre-summer and 2-year lagged precipitation respectively decrease and increase BA, but the effects are minor and non-significant when both variables are included in the model. Land use conflicts (expressed through more fires) played a role, but it was afforestation and agricultural abandonment that supported the fire regime shifts, explaining weather-drought as the current major driver of BA as well. We conclude that bottom-up factors, i.e. human-induced changes in landscape flammability and ignition density, can enhance or override the influence of weather-drought on the fire regime in Mediterranean humid regions. A more relevant role of fuel control in fire management policies and practices is warranted by our findings.","","article","","146","","","The dynamics and drivers of fuel and fire in the Portuguese public forest","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479714004290","0301-4797","2014","373-382","Journal of Environmental Management"

Compared to ice sheets and circulating ocean currents, sea-ice is ephemeral and continental-scale changes to sea ice cover occur seasonally. Sea-ice greatly influences polar albedo, atmosphere-ocean gas exchange and vertical mixing of polar ocean masses. Major changes in sea ice distribution and thickness have been invoked as drivers of deglaciations as well as stadial climate variability described in Greenland climate records as “Dansgaard-Oeschger” cycles and described in Antarctic climate records as “Antarctic Isotopic Maxima”. The role of halogens in polar atmospheric chemistry has been studied intensively over the past few decades. This research has been driven by the role of bromine, primarily as gas-phase bromine monoxide (BrO), which exerts a key control on polar tropospheric ozone concentrations. Initial findings led to the discovery of boundary-layer self-catalyzing heterogeneous bromine reactions fed by sunlight and ozone, known as bromine explosions. First-year sea-ice and blowing snow have been identified as key components for this heterogeneous bromine recycling in the polar boundary layer. This understanding of polar halogen chemistry – supported by an expanding body of observations and modeling – has formed the basis for investigating quantitative links between halogen concentrations in the polar atmospheric boundary layer and sea-ice presence and/or extent. Despite the clear importance of sea-ice in paleoclimate research, the ice core community lacks a conservative and quantitative proxy for sea-ice extent. The most commonly applied proxy, methanesulphonic acid (MSA), is volatile and has not been demonstrated reliably for ice core records extending beyond the last few centuries. Sodium has also been applied to reconstruct sea-ice extent in a semi-quantitative manner although the effects of meteorological transport noise are significant. Contrary to a priori expectations, the halogens bromine and iodine appear to be stable in polar snow and ice over millennial timescales, addressing the temporal limitations of MSA records. Unfortunately, transport and meteorological variability influence sodium deposition as well as the deposition of halogens and the many other ionic impurities found in ice cores. The atmospheric chemistry of halogens is more complex than those of sodium or MSA due to the mixed-phase (gas and aerosol) nature of halogen photochemistry. Thus the application of halogen records in ice cores to sea-ice reconstruction overcomes some challenges posed by existing proxies, but also opens new challenges specific to halogens. Challenges common to all sea-ice proxies include the deconvolution of changes in emission source locations and changes in transport efficacy, particularly those occurring during climate transitions combining changes in sea-ice and atmospheric circulation, such as stadial/interstadial or glacial/interglacial climate variability. In this review, we describe the rationale and available evidence for linking the halogens bromine and iodine found in polar snow and ice to sea-ice extent. Reported measurements of bromine and iodine in polar snow and ice samples are critically discussed. We also consider aspects of halogen transport and retention in polar snow and ice that are still poorly understood. Overall, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the application of bromine to sea-ice reconstructions, and the use of iodine to reconstruct marine biological activity mediated in part by sea-ice extent. These halogens complement existing sea-ice proxies but most crucially, offer the capacity to greatly extend the temporal and spatial coverage of ice core-based sea-ice reconstructions. We identify knowledge gaps existing in the current understanding of spatial and temporal variability of halogen distributions in the polar regions. We suggest areas where polar halogen chemistry can contribute to a better understanding of the halogen records recovered from ice cores. Finally, we propose future steps for establishing reliable and constructive sea-ice reconstructions based on bromine and iodine as observed in snow and ice cores.","","article","","269","","","Sea-ice reconstructions from bromine and iodine in ice cores","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379121003401","0277-3791","2021","107133","Quaternary Science Reviews"

However, recent intense drought conditions have raised concerns for current water resource availability. Patterns of long-term ground and surface water (GSW) changes, and their response to environmental conditions, land-use dynamics, and socioeconomic changes are not well-understood across this large and diverse country. To address this crucial gap, we identified regions of ground and surface water (GSW) changes in all the Provinces of Canada between 2002 and 2016 from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets. We explored the relationships between GSW changes and environmental, socioeconomic, and land-use dynamics over time. We found that all the Provinces of Canada gained a net 4.46 mm Liquid Water Equivalent (LWE) per year, equivalent to a total increase of 66.9 mm LWE. GSW increases were significantly associated with the normalized difference vegetation index and evapotranspiration rates. In contrast, GSW declines were significantly related to deforestation rate, urban expansion, and economic development (median household income). Despite apparent widespread post-drought recovery detected from 2002 to 2016, the rapid GSW declines were also observed in almost all of Western Canada and part of Ontario, amounting to a net loss of 66.13 mm. This indicates that a pronounced drought had emerged. It is anticipated that Canada will be experiencing more frequent and severe droughts under ongoing climate change and increasing demand for water resources.","","article","","322","","","Examining ground and surface water changes in response to environmental variables, land use dynamics, and socioeconomic changes in Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479722014487","0301-4797","2022","115875","Journal of Environmental Management"

By estimating the trajectories of other vessels, sub-systems such as collision avoidance algorithms can plan ahead accordingly in order to avoid conflicts. To estimate the trajectories of other vessels, the use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a good candidate data-point, as this is becoming increasingly more common, and in some cases even mandated, on-board vessels. This paper presents a data-driven approach that uses the historical AIS data within a selected area in the Danish waters. The historical data is transformed into a probabilistic heat map using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and is further encoded using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) before entered into the estimation scheme. The estimation scheme consists of a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) configuration, which is sampled multiple times, yielding a single trajectory prediction with uncertainty. The performance of the estimation scheme is demonstrated and compared against two other commonly used methods, showing that the probabilistic heat map provides valuable information, compared to the baseline methods.","","article","","54","","","Trajectory Prediction for Marine Vessels using Historical AIS Heatmaps and Long Short-Term Memory Networks⁎⁎This research is sponsored by the Danish Innovation Fund, The Danish Maritime Fund, Orients Fund and the Lauritzen Foundation through the Autonomy part of the ShippingLab project, Grant number 8090-00063B.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896321014798","2405-8963","2021","83-89","IFAC-PapersOnLine"

Although convective systems are usually linked to coastal orography, some severe thunderstorms develop and mature over the sea. A recent example is the severe thunderstorm that affected the island of Mallorca in the afternoon of 4 October 2007. The storm formed early in the morning offshore of Murcia, and steadily became organized into a squall line. Arriving in Palma city, this squall line produced severe gusts, heavy rain and several tornadoes. The initiation and evolution of convection in these kinds of maritime events depend on both synoptic and mesoscale features. Representing such interactions is a challenge for numerical weather prediction. The aim of this study is to determine the prominent factors involved in the initiation and evolution of the damaging squall line, by means of high resolution numerical experiments. We also focus on squall line mesovortices to explain the potential for tornado development and the role of Mallorcan orography on their evolution. Simulations performed with the mesoscale model Méso-NH allowed relevant mechanisms for initiation and development of the strong squall line to be identified. The squall line initiates in an area with conditional instability, characterized by a cut-off and a southerly jet aloft and by moist, warm air at low-levels along a front. In addition, the area of low-level convergence offshore of Murcia, associated with the front and enhanced by a low downstream of the Atlas range, was shown to be crucial during the early stage of the convective system. The dry layer in the mid-troposphere and the strong sheared environment provide elements for understanding the development of such a damaging squall line. Moreover, a very high resolution experiment (600m mesh) gave a very realistic representation of the squall line, including mesovortices ahead of the gust front, which confirmed the potential of this strong convective system for the genesis of small-scale vortices that may precede tornado development. A sensitivity experiment pointed out the prominent role of Mallorcan orography in straightening mesovortices approaching Palma city, and provided interesting elements for the understanding of the localization of tornadoes that occurred on 4 October 2007.","","article","","100","","","Initiation of a severe thunderstorm over the Mediterranean Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809510003054","0169-8095","2011","603-620","Atmospheric Research"

This resulted in internally consistent interpretation of the late Famennian Hangenberg Crisis in subtropical deepest water sites of the epeiric Rhenohercynian and Saxo–Thuringian basins, as well as more open sites of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. High mercury concentrations were detected in all of the studied sections, with the highest values strata in the Carnic Alps (up to 20 ppm) and Thuringia (up to 1.5 ppm). The beginning of the Hg anomaly and the presence of pyroclastic material, indicate that local magmatic activity was initiated before the deposition of the Hangenberg Black Shale (HBS). The onset of the HBS deposition coincided with the expansion of phosphate-enriched, anoxic to euxinic waters during short-lived CO2-greenhouse spike of a warm–humid climate. Intensive magmatic activity was a trigger for climatic changes, an excessive eutrophication, and an accelerated burial of organic carbon during the Hangenberg transgressive pulse. The injection of catastrophic amounts of CO2, toxic elements and acids from volcanic activity could have led to acidification, mutation of spores, and episodes of mass mortality of marine plankton.","","article","","190","","","Large environmental disturbances caused by magmatic activity during the Late Devonian Hangenberg Crisis","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092181812030045X","0921-8181","2020","103155","Global and Planetary Change"

Continuous vertical mixing of the water column by strong currents, violent tidal water exchanges in deep fjords and frequent strong winds do not favour the seasonal appearance of large phytoplankton blooms. In contrast, the southern WAP is bound by the continental shelf, and is under the influence of the weaker Antarctic Peninsula Coastal Current (APCC), maintaining seasonal winter sea ice, which provides a shallow mixed layer, which in turn supports high levels of biological production in summer. During the 2009 / 2010 summer, however, a distinctive bloom event (chl-a > 20 μgL−1) was documented for in Admiralty Bay (AB), the largest and deepest fjord in KGI. It commenced in early summer (29 December 2009) at the edge of melting sea ice which had persisted since the preceding cold winter of 2009. The phytoplankton group dynamics, determined using photosynthetic pigment data, and associated changes in nutrient concentration during the bloom, have been described in this paper. The area where the phytoplankton bloom developed coincided with the surface of the brash sea ice cover. The sequence and size of biological and chemical changes recorded within the fjord during the bloom resembled the recurring ice edge blooms which occur in the southern WAP, although they had a much shorter lifespan (< two weeks), which may have been due to the slow SE winds and related surface water movement direction, which hindered vertical mixing and kept the surface water within the fjord.","","article","","226","","","Massive diatom bloom initiated by high winter sea ice in Admiralty Bay (King George Island, South Shetlands) in relation to nutrient concentrations in the water column during the 2009/2010 summer","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796321001615","0924-7963","2022","103667","Journal of Marine Systems"

This lack of data is generally the result of deep water (>500 m), difficult geology (volcanics and salt), remoteness and harsh met–ocean conditions. These characteristics present significant challenges to marine surveying, which means that frontier basins tend to be underexplored. With continuing interest in exploration for energy resources in frontier regions, many frontier basins around the world have been the focus of increasingly-sophisticated geophysical studies that integrate a range of methodologies, including those based on potential-field (gravity and magnetic) data. Underexplored frontier basins around Australia's continental margin have received increased attention during the last decade, largely as a result of government-funded programs of precompetitive data acquisition and analysis. The components of this work that have relied heavily on potential-field data include: first-pass depth-to-basement estimation using spectral techniques applied to magnetic data; enhancement of gravity and magnetic images to aid the identification of basin depocentres and to facilitate onshore–offshore geological interpretation of basement structure; multi-scale edge-detection applied to gravity and magnetic data to aid the interpretation of basement structure; 3D forward and stochastic inverse modelling of gravity data to guide seismic interpretation of sediment thickness and basement structure; and using supercomputers for high-resolution, regional-scale 3D inverse modelling of magnetic and gravity data to constrain the physical properties of the crust. Despite the additional insight offered by this work, efforts to understand frontier basins are not without challenges, one of the most fundamental of which is to ensure that non-specialists are not misinterpreting data (e.g. wrongly interpreting artefacts arising from specific processing). The other main challenge in Australian frontier basins arises from a lack of constraints on crustal structure. This leads to significant ambiguity when using gravity data to infer sediment thickness or to understand the nature of basement. This ambiguity could be vastly reduced through the acquisition of seismic refraction data that focuses on imaging crustal structure. Further opportunities exist in using alternative methods for automated depth-to-basement estimation, incorporating process-oriented rather than static potential-field modelling, and in applying 3D forward and inverse gravity and magnetic modelling to other Australian frontier basins.","","article","","59","","","Potential-field data in integrated frontier basin geophysics: Successes and challenges on Australia's continental margin","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817214000233","0264-8172","2015","611-637","Marine and Petroleum Geology"

In general, there is an increase in rank from SE to NW and from NE to SW. Superimposed on this pattern are several anomalies. At several locations, ranks change rapidly over short distances. An example is in the Mount Allan syncline, where the reflectances in the Kootenay section on the SW vertical limb range from 0.68 to 0.94% R0 max in contrast to a range of 1.30–2.49% R0 max for a comparable section on the NE upright limb. This variation occurs over a distance of about 3 km. Multiple intersections of Kootenay strata in oil wells at the south end of the area show low reflectances (0.76% Ro max) at depths of about 3800 m with no change in the shallower Kootenay repeats, whereas wells farther north show higher reflectances and increase with depth. Different burial depths, the influence of thick thrust plates, different paleogeothermal gradients and ground-water movements, all likely have played a part in generating these coalification patterns. A significant part of the coalification in the Kootenay Group appears to have been postdeformational. The rank of the coals in the various subbasins of the Maritimes Basin is nearly all bituminous. Evidence indicates that most of the coalification is postdeformational. Rank within a given coal bed generally increases with increase in depth of present-day burial and the pattern seems to be generally true for most of the coal fields studied. The average postdeformational component of total coalification has been calculated to be 72%. The most important coal field in the Maritimes Basin is the Sydney coal field. Here ranks have been shown to increase from NW to SE and from SW to NE, the latter direction following the downdip structure of the field. Coalification gradients for the Sydney field range from 0.052 to 0.088 R0 max/100 m, reflecting different paleogeothermal gradients. In New Brunswick, local rank increases to anthracite are believed to be related to igneous activities. Reflectance measurements have been used to interpret stratigraphy and structure in several fields and even to trace the origin of coaly fragments obtained from deep-sea drilling near Bermuda.","","article","","13","","","Distribution and coalification patterns in Canadian bituminous and anthracite coals","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166516289900955","0166-5162","1989","207-260","International Journal of Coal Geology"

The weather extremes will intensify and threaten the well-being of the people in the tropical areas, and one of these intensifications would be wildfire burning. Over the years, Southeast Asia, Amazon, Australia, and East Coast of the United States of America have all experienced severe wildfires burning due to the proliferation of slash-and-burn practices, bad land use management, and natural causes; however, similarly climate change has played a crucial role in intensifying these burning conditions. The emission of these biomass burning haze also contains components that exhibit climatic forcing ability to modify the surface and atmospheric heat content as well as precipitation conditions. To control these wildfires, intervention requires the fundamental understanding of the burning source and the conducive weather conditions to assist the decision-making and preventive measurement. This is the intention of this chapter. The existing capabilities of the fire prediction models based on historical and continual monitoring tools and forest fire danger rating system are detailed and assessed. The chapter also discusses the future projection of the fire condition due to the changing climate condition and its potential implication and outlook.","","incollection","Academic Press","","Handbook of Energy and Environmental Security","978-0-12-824084-7","Chapter 10 - Wildfires, haze, and climate change","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128240847000138","","2022","183-205",""

The highest lightning densities (LDs) were observed over the coastal areas of southeast Asia and the tropical islands, which differs significantly from the distribution of the highest precipitation rates. The LD in the South China Sea (SCS) was much higher than that over the deep ocean and showed a peak that was 3 h ahead of that seen in the open sea. A sharp increase in LD on the Indo-China Peninsula and in the SCS was observed during the pre-monsoon season. The monthly variations show that the highest lightning activity occurred during July, August, and September, which is consistent with the variations in the monthly precipitation rate. The contribution of tropical cyclones (TCs) and the impact of El Nino and La Nina events on lightning climatology over the northwest Pacific region were also examined. Two areas of maximum TC lightning were observed to the east of the Philippines and south of China, indicating that frequent lightning is produced when TCs are approaching landfall. The average LD during El Nino events increases by 10.3%, whereas during La Nina events it decreases by 4.8%. A northward shift in the positive lightning anomaly was observed in the SCS, from the southern SCS during the El Nino to the central and northern SCS during the La Nina periods.","","article","","210","","","Lightning climatology over the northwest Pacific region: An 11-year study using data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809517311110","0169-8095","2018","41-57","Atmospheric Research"

Selected bioconstructions developed in various palaeogeographic settings and depositional environments on northwestern Tethys and eastern Atlantic margins: pure carbonate lagoon, carbonate-dominated deep shelf to epicontinental basin and mixed carbonate-siliciclastic shallow ramp and lagoon. The proximity to terrigenous sources directly controlled REE patterns of carbonate samples. Lateral and intra-reef sediments, and to a lesser degree stromatolitic microbial crusts, are more susceptible to contamination by terrigenous material than are microbialites of thrombolitic fabric. In mixed carbonate-siliciclastic settings, microbialites display a flat shale-normalized REE pattern. In pure carbonate lagoonal settings, microbialites have shale-normalized REE patterns similar to those of modern seawaters with a negative Ce anomaly [(Ce/Ce⁎) up to 0.14], positive La and Gd anomalies, and light REE depletion relative to heavy REE. These data imply that similar REE chemistry than modern seawater already occurred on the northwestern Tethys margin at the Upper Jurassic. Strong negative Ce anomalies (<0.4) imply microbialite formation in well-oxygenated seawaters both in coral reefs of pure carbonate lagoonal environments (Pagny-sur-Meuse) and sponge bioherms of deep-shelf settings (Plettenberg). Absence of positive Ce anomalies rules out an influence of alkaline and high-pH seawaters. Thus, REE patterns and Nd isotopic signatures, which are in perfect agreement with existing results for Tethysian seawater, confirm that microbialites can be used as proxies of palaeoenvironmental seawater chemical characteristics.","","article","","230","","","Rare earth and trace elements of microbialites in Upper Jurassic coral- and sponge-microbialite reefs","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254105005231","0009-2541","2006","105-123","Chemical Geology"

CPSs integrate computing and communication with control and monitoring of entities in the physical world. Due to the tight coupling of cyber and physical domains, and to the possible catastrophic consequences of the malicious attacks on critical infrastructures, security is one of the key concerns. However, the exponential growth of IoT has led to deployment of CPSes without support for enforcing important security properties. Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to be effective for securing these systems. Mining the specifications of CPSes by experts is a cumbersome and error-prone task. Therefore, it is essential to dynamically monitor the CPS to learn its common behaviors and formulate specifications for detecting malicious bugs and security attacks. Existing solutions for specification mining only combine data and events, but not time. However, time is a semantic property in CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for obtaining high accuracy. This paper proposes ARTINALI++, which dynamically mines specifications in CPS systems with arbitrary size and complexity. ARTINALI++ captures the security properties by incorporating time as a substantial property of the system, and generate a multi-dimensional model for the general CPS systems. Moreover, it enhances the model through discovering invariants that represent the physical motions and distinct operational modes in complex CPS systems. We build Intrusion Detection Systems based on ARTINALI++ for three CPSes with various levels of complexity including smart meter, smart artificial pancreas and unmanned aerial vehicle, and measure their detection accuracy. We find that the ARTINALI++ significantly reduces the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 23.45% and 73.6% on average, respectively, over other dynamic specification mining tools on the three CPS platforms.","","article","","180","","","ARTINALI++: Multi-dimensional Specification Mining for Complex Cyber-Physical System Security","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221001138","0164-1212","2021","111016","Journal of Systems and Software"

Meteorological heatwave monitoring and prediction services vary between heatwave definitions which either include humidity or are based only on temperature. Incorporation of humidity into human health heatwave studies and warning services has been variable. Whilst higher humidity is a known stressor during heatwaves, humidity is known to confound interpretation of heatwave data and can be difficult to monitor and forecast. This study examines the effect of humidity on diagnosed heatwave severity across Australia’s diverse climate zones. Dry bulb temperature is used as the only input into the Bureau of Meteorology’s current operational Excess Heat Factor (EHF) index. Alternative humidity-affected temperature indices (Apparent Temperature, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature and Heat Index) are examined for suitability as input to EHF to compare the incidence of dry and humidity-affected heatwave severity within Australia. This paper uses maximum and minimum dry and humidity affected temperature indices extracted from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA). Our investigation demonstrates Australia’s operational temperature-only percentile-based heatwave severity service provides effective heatwave warning guidance for five of Australia’s six diverse climate zones.

Subsequently, the cost effectiveness of the current safety approach is established. This review found that fire prevention could be made more cost effective if its scope was broadened beyond the detection of proximate events occurring immediately before ignition. The findings suggest that more cost-effective safety measures can be developed by addressing systemic causes of fire.

We used summer-time thermal infrared images from 1999 through 2009 acquired by the Landsat satellite and, through the process of image stacking, identified a region where the surface persistently showed temperatures 5°C to 14°C higher than the background areas. Field validation confirmed that this thermal anomaly area corresponds to a previously undocumented shallow coal seam fire. Superimposing the boundary of the Rex Creek forest fire revealed that the coal seam fire was at the southern end of the burn area where the forest fire originated.

Composite patterns of sea-level pressure, 500hPa geopotential heights, storm tracks and surface air temperature are presented for four situations: periods of strong Aleutian Low, weak Aleutian Low, warm Bering Sea air temperatures, and cold Bering Sea air temperatures. Winter temperatures in the Bering Sea are only marginally related to the strength of the Aleutian Low, and are much more sensitive to the position of the Aleutian Low and to variations in storm tracks. In particular, relatively warm temperatures are associated with either an enhanced storm track off the coast of Siberia, and hence anomalous southerly low-level flow, or an enhanced storm track entering the eastern Bering Sea from the southeast. These latter storms do not systematically affect the mean meridional winds, but rather serve to transport mild air of maritime origin over the Bering Sea. The leading indices for the North Pacific, such as the NP and PNA, are more representative of the patterns of tropospheric circulation and storm track anomalies associated with the strength of the Aleutian Low than patterns associated with warm and cold wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea.","","article","","54","","","The Aleutian Low, storm tracks, and winter climate variability in the Bering Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064507002007","0967-0645","2007","2560-2577","Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography"

However, the diffuser system employed to deliver ozone to the ballast water tanks resulted in patchiness in TRO distribution and toxicity to entrained organisms. In this follow-up study, the shipboard diffuser system was replaced by a single Venturi-type injection system designed to deliver a more homogeneous biocide distribution.

Whereas the results on the power spectrum analysis by the Multi-Taper Method (MTM) on δtg, Rz and aa reveal periodicities of ∼79–80 years (Gleissberg's cycle) and ∼9–11 years (Schwabe solar cycle) consistent with earlier findings, MTM spectrum analysis also reveals fast cycles of 3–5 years. A period of ∼4.2 years in aa at 99% confidence level appears recorded in δtg at ∼4.3 years at 90% confidence level. A period of ∼3.6–3.7 years at 99% confidence level found in δtg is correlating with a similar periodic variation in sector structure of Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). This fast cycle parallelism is new and is supportive of a possible link between the solar-modulated geomagnetic activity and Earth's climatic parameter i.e. SST.","","article","","73","","","Solar-geomagnetic activity influence on Earth's climate","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682610004050","1364-6826","2011","1607-1615","Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics"

Nearly 500mm of rain, a third of the average annual rainfall, fell in six hours. Six people perished and millions of Euros in damages occurred. The synoptic-scale meteorological system moved across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Mediterranean generating floods that killed 5 people in Southern France, before moving over the Ligurian Sea and Genoa producing the extreme event studied here. Cloud-permitting simulations (1km) of the finger-like convective system responsible for the torrential event over Genoa have been performed using Advanced Research Weather and Forecasting Model (ARW-WRF, version 3.3). Two different microphysics (WSM6 and Thompson) as well as three different convection closures (explicit, Kain–Fritsch, and Betts–Miller–Janjic) were evaluated to gain a deeper understanding of the physical processes underlying the observed heavy rain event and the model's capability to predict, in hindcast mode, its structure and evolution. The impact of forecast initialization and of model vertical discretization on hindcast results is also examined. Comparison between model hindcasts and observed fields provided by raingauge data, satellite data, and radar data show that this particular event is strongly sensitive to the details of the mesoscale initialization despite being evolved from a relatively large scale weather system. Only meso-γ details of the event were not well captured by the best setting of the ARW-WRF model and so peak hourly rainfalls were not exceptionally well reproduced. The results also show that specification of microphysical parameters suitable to these events have a positive impact on the prediction of heavy precipitation intensity values.","","article","","138","","","Analysis and hindcast simulations of an extreme rainfall event in the Mediterranean area: The Genoa 2011 case","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809513002809","0169-8095","2014","13-29","Atmospheric Research"

This was verified qualitatively through an experimental test program. The experimental results are examined in relation to the FE predictions and the implications for a practical strain-based SHM system are discussed. A technique is developed, based on novel signal processing and statistical outlier detection. This enables the sensor measurements to be used for damage detection without reference to a high-fidelity numerical model of the structure which is often difficult and resource-intensive to generate. The technique is shown to provide successful damage diagnoses with an acceptable level of accuracy.

In this region, humpback whales migrate annually from their winter breeding grounds off the coast of Brazil to their summer feeding grounds near to the Polar Front, an area that includes the waters of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). This latter region includes a Marine Protected Area (MPA), which has been developed to ensure sustainable management of fisheries, and protection of foraging predators. To date, management measures within the MPA have primarily been concerned with foraging predators that rely upon Antarctic krill, including for a number of previously over-exploited species. With humpback whales increasing in the western South Atlantic, understandingnderstanding their spatiotemporal distribution within the MPA is important as it will help inform management particularly in respect of interactions between humpback whales and the regional fishery for Antarctic krill. Here we develop habitat models from the distribution and movement patterns of 16 individuals at their high-latitude feeding grounds, south of 50°S. We show that whale habitat use varies throughout the foraging period. Upon reaching their feeding ground, whales use the area to the east of the South Sandwich Islands, moving westward into the centre of the Scotia Arc and towards South Georgia during the high summer, and then expanding back towards the east in the winter. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for the future, including necessary research required for underpinning management.","","article","","198","","","Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) distribution and movements in the vicinity of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064522000595","0967-0645","2022","105074","Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography"

As such it represents an opportunity for intra-seasonal rainfall prediction and, perhaps, for explaining dynamics that underlie longer term variability and trends. This opportunity is of substantial interest for tropical Africa, where rainfall variability has significant impacts on agriculture, energy, and natural ecosystems. The objective of this review paper is to inventory and assess the state of knowledge of MJO influence on African rainfall. A number of studies have identified statistical links between MJO and sub-seasonal rainfall variability in West, East, and Southern Africa. The proposed mechanisms to explain this influence differ by region and by season, and they often involve multiscale interactions between local precipitation processes and MJO-associated atmospheric dynamics. Dynamically-based forecast systems have some skill in predicting MJO evolution to time horizons of 3–4weeks, and some can capture teleconnections to Africa. On longer time scales, there is evidence that MJO activity both modulates and is modulated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. The implications of these interactions for MJO connections to Africa require further research, as does the potential for trends in MJO behavior and impacts on Africa under global climate change.","","article","","184","","","Madden-Julian Oscillation impacts on tropical African precipitation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809516304185","0169-8095","2017","88-102","Atmospheric Research"

Quantifying species' relationships with the underlying environment is further complicated by the scale-dependent nature of these processes. Multi-scale analyses that incorporate aspects of a species' biology and build on large datasets are therefore required to understand long-term distribution and inform appropriate management measures. In this study, we use monitoring data collected over two study periods (2003–2008 and 2012–2018) to assess the habitat use, trend in local occurrence, and change in distribution of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, around the Balearic Islands (Spain), one of the few recognised breeding and feeding grounds for the ‘Endangered’ population in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we investigate the differences in the habitat use of single animals and groups, to explore intra-specific niche partitioning in this highly social but behaviourally dimorphic species. Results suggest that overall the occurrence of sperm whales in the area has been increasing over time. Animals were found to associate with distinct bathymetric features, but the mechanisms generating these relationships, and the underlying oceanographic processes within this habitat, remained uncertain. Sperm whale distribution also underwent a significant shift between the two study periods, with an increased occurrence in the Mallorca channel and north of Menorca, which further points towards a dynamic use of the broader bathymetric range preferred around the archipelago. Finally, our analyses highlighted that single animals and groups used areas with different characteristics, with groups preferring deeper, warmer waters characterised by lower sea level anomaly, which resulted in some fine-scale spatial segregation. The results of this study shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the biogeography and complex social system of the species, and support the design of targeted conservation measures in this important breeding and feeding ground.","","article","","155","","","Multi-scale analysis reveals changing distribution patterns and the influence of social structure on the habitat use of an endangered marine predator, the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus in the Western Mediterranean Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063719303152","0967-0637","2020","103169","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

In this model, ship traffic and ships were converted into a molecular system. After being obtained using an analytical method, collision risk was generalized as distance to model the collision risk by radial distribution function. Finally, a space interpolation technique was applied to visualize the geographical distribution of collision risk. To validate the proposed model, the AIS data contained in Bohai Strait was used to conduct experiment. According to the experimental results, the map as obtained by the proposed model is capable to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk, and is advantageous over the traditional method in the instantaneity and accuracy of identification.

These smart agents will not only detect anomalies, they are expected to provide sufficient data to facilitate mapping the detected anomalies, while—cleverly—adopting their behavior based on the changes presented in the environment. However, given these objectives and due to MASA’s miniaturization, conventional designing methods are not suitable to design MASA. On one hand, it is not possible to use the widely adopted simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) schemes, because of the hardware limitations on-board of MASA. Furthermore, the targeted environments for MASA in a smart city are typically GPS-denied, hardly accessible, and either completely or partially unknown. Furthermore, designing MASA’s hardware and their autonomous on-line behavior presents an additional challenge. In this chapter, we present a framework dubbed as evolutionary localization and mapping (EVOLAM), which uses multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to tackle the design and algorithmic challenges in using MASAs in monitoring infrastructure. This framework facilitates offline localization and mapping, while adaptively tuning offline hardware constraints and online behavior.

Our study area, the SW Barents Sea, is unique in its evolution due to the effect of glaciations which removed thick layers of sediment from the seabed. Unloading due to erosion and deglaciation resulted in opening of pre-existing faults and creation of new ones, facilitating fluid migration and eventually escape into the water from the subsurface. Expressions of hydrocarbon gas accumulation and fluid flow such as gas hydrates and pockmarks are widely distributed in the Barents Sea. Several gas flares, some of them 200m high in echograms, occur along a segment of the Ringvassøy Loppa Fault Complex, indicating open fractures and active fluid flow. Observation of gas flares along regional fault complexes outside pockmark regions indicates that present gas escape occurs along faults only. The pockmark formation and gas flares belong to different episodes of fluid flow. The pockmarks are absent outside soft sediment depocentres indicating that their existence is related to the presence of recording medium. The thin sediment cover in pockmarks and their penetration down into glaciomarine sediments indicate that they formed after deposition of these sediments and that fluid escape was active to the very recent past. Methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) modelling shows that after the last glacial maximum 18000–2000014Cyears ago, the MHSZ has thinned from 600m to zero in most parts of the SW Barents Sea. The fluid expulsion probably happened after retreat of the glaciers causing release of methane from dissociation of methane hydrates through fluid escape processes which lasted until recently. Bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) observed are probably due to structure II hydrates formed from gas containing higher order hydrocarbon components such as ethane, propane, etc. along with methane. The study area falls close to the new gigantic oil discoveries, Skrugard and Havis, and north of the Snøhvit hydrocarbon field.","","article","","331-332","","","Multiple episodes of fluid flow in the SW Barents Sea (Loppa High) evidenced by gas flares, pockmarks and gas hydrate accumulation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X12001446","0012-821X","2012","305-314","Earth and Planetary Science Letters"

We use the CORSIKA and sim_telarray programs for Monte Carlo simulations of gamma ray showers, hadronic background and the telescope response. We focus here on gamma ray measurements in the low energy, sub-100GeV, range. Therefore, we only consider the performance of arrays of several large telescopes. Neglecting the GF effect, we find (in agreement with previous studies) that such arrays have lower energy thresholds, and larger collection areas below 30GeV, when located at higher altitudes. We point out, however, that in the considered ranges of altitudes and magnetic field intensities, 1800–3600m a.s.l. and 0–40μT, respectively, the GF effect has a similar magnitude to this altitude effect. We provide the trigger-level performance parameters of the observatory affected by the GF effect, in particular the collection areas, detection rates and the energy thresholds for all five locations, which information may be useful in the selection of sites for CTA. We also find simple scaling of these parameters with the magnetic field strength, which can be used to assess the magnitude of the GF effect for other sites; in this work we use them to estimate the performance parameters for five sites: South Africa-Beaufort West, USA-Yavapai Ranch, Namibia-Calapanzi, Chile-La Silla and India-Hanle. We roughly investigate the impact of the geophysical conditions on gamma/hadron separation procedures involving image shape and direction cuts. We note that the change of altitude has an opposite effect at the trigger and analysis levels, i.e. gains in triggering efficiency at higher altitudes are partially balanced by losses in the separation efficiency. In turn, a stronger GF spoils both the shape and the direction discrimination of gamma rays, thus its effects at the trigger and analysis levels add up resulting in a significant reduction of the observatory performance. Overall, our results indicate that the local GF strength at a site can be equally important as its altitude for the low-energy performance of CTA.","","article","","45","","","Influence of the geomagnetic field on the IACT detection technique for possible sites of CTA observatories","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927650513000285","0927-6505","2013","1-12","Astroparticle Physics"

On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services. In this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified branches, focusing on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based key distribution schemes. For each of the above domains, we highlight the most essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned, and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers and investors, ultimately unleashing the full potential behind ubiquitous satellite communications.","","article","","216","","","Satellite-based communications security: A survey of threats, solutions, and research challenges","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138912862200319X","1389-1286","2022","109246","Computer Networks"

MJO was active during the onset phase of the 1997/98 ENSO, but weak and had a shorter period (less than a month) fluctuation during the mature and decaying phase of the last ENSO. By using the 10-year SSM/I Wentz dataset of wind speed and rainfall, we find two types of tropical cyclogenesis; low-level wind shear type and cloud cluster type. The former is characterized by strong meridional gradient of wind speed over the suppressed ITCZ in the northern hemisphere, mainly in equinox periods. The latter is related with the weak wind regime, mainly dominated in summer hemispheres. Special interest is that there was no tropical cyclone activity over the northwestern Pacific region in 1998 up to early July. The SSM/I data in May 1998 shows that the northern ITCZ was extremely weaker than normal with stronger trade winds. This feature was related with both enhanced local Hadley circulation and Walker circulation. The former was characterized by the positive (negative) rainfall anomaly and positive (negative) humidity anomaly over the south central/eastern (north) Pacific. The latter was related with enhanced convective activity over the Indian Ocean. Although the higher SST over the western Pacific was favorable for the generation, tropical cyclones were not generated without any cyclonic disturbances originated from the ITCZ.","","article","","25","","","MJO and tropical cyclone activity during 1997/98 ENSO","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027311779900928X","0273-1177","2000","953-958","Advances in Space Research"

At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.","","article","","65","","","A strategy for detecting derelict fishing gear at sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X11004942","0025-326X","2012","7-15","Marine Pollution Bulletin"

The Mediterranean route of colonization (6000–5600 BCE), is characterized by the so-called Impressed Wares (IW) or Impresso-Cardial Complex (ICC) which demonstrate huge internal diversity in material culture, notably in pottery style and technology. This polythetic imprint of the ICC is intimately linked to dynamics of raw material exploitation (such as obsidian) and interconnections within circulation and exchange networks of goods. Through a comparative and multi-analytical approach to pottery characterization of entire assemblages from two distant sites in the North-Western Mediterranean, each characterized by predominantly local pottery production, we demonstrate long-distance mobility of non-local pottery vessels from the Tyrrhenian regions towards the Languedoc (up to 1000 km) during the Neolithic transition.

The FC suffered two severe drought episodes separated by a 7-year period, in 1998–2000 and 2007–2009, which are considered the most severe episodes to hit the region in the last 50 years. A Lagrangian model (FLEXPART) and ERA-Interim data (with a 1° × 1° lat-long resolution) were used to identify for the first time the climatological sources of moisture for the FC and their characteristics. Variability and the source-receptor relationships, concerning their contribution to the precipitation, and the implications regarding the transport of moisture changes over the FC, during the wet season (October-May) from 1980 to 2014 were analysed. The main climatological moisture sources during this period were determined to be the FC itself, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the central and western parts of the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis showed higher anomalous conditions in the moisture transport from some moisture sources during the two outstanding drought episodes. The key feature of the wet seasons during these episodes was a deficit in the moisture losses over the studied area related to the FC itself, the Red and Arabian Seas sources, followed and to a lesser extent by the eastern Mediterranean Sea over the northern part of the FC region. Nevertheless, the moisture supply deficit from the sources was much greater during the 2007–2009 drought event. The SPEI index at large scales (24 months) showed that the 2007–2009 episode was part of longer-term drought conditions that had been developing over the previous months, reinforcing the drought severity given recycling processes attributed to the FC. During the two extreme drought episodes, the mountainous terrain over the northern and eastern FC suffered the highest precipitation deficits, and these areas are, precisely, the most influenced by two of the major moisture sources, namely, the FC and eastern Mediterranean Sea. The decreased moisture contribution from these main sources led to more intense droughts over the region. As a result, both regions should be considered as hotspots to signal severe or extreme droughts in the region.","","article","","560","","","A Lagrangian analysis of the moisture budget over the Fertile Crescent during two intense drought episodes","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169418301872","0022-1694","2018","382-395","Journal of Hydrology"

Pediatric adipose tumors are mainly represented by lipomas, though only 28 cytogenetic descriptions of pediatric lipoma have been reported to date. Similar to adult cases, most of these pediatric lipomas harbored rearrangements of the chromosomal regions 12q14–q15 and 6p21, involving the HMGA2 and HMGA1 genes. Further cytogenetic studies of pediatric lipoma would be useful to determinate whether some partner genes of HMGA2, such as NFIB, may have a specific role in the early onset of these tumors. Cytogenetically, the best documented pediatric adipose tumor is lipoblastoma, which is the second most frequent adipose tumor in children. Chromosomal alterations in lipoblastoma, observed in 61% of cases studied by conventional cytogenetics, typically involve the 8q11–q12 region. The target gene of this rearrangement is PLAG1. Anomalies of PLAG1 have been observed in 70% of cases of pediatric adipose tumors studied by molecular cytogenetics methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or comparative genomic hybridization on array (array-CGH). The rare described cases of malignant pediatric adipose tumors in children are mostly myxoid liposarcomas. In the 27 cases explored at the genetic level, all pediatric myxoid liposarcomas showed the classical rearrangement of the DDIT3 gene at 12q13. In conclusion, the epidemiology and the prevalence of histological types of adipose tissue tumors differ in the pediatric population compared with adults, whereas chromosomal and genic rearrangements are similar to those of adult cases in each histological type.","","article","","208","","","Molecular cytogenetics of pediatric adipocytic tumors","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210776215001271","2210-7762","2015","469-481","Cancer Genetics"

We relied upon remote-sensing observations of wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration along with model predictions of mixed layer depth (MLD), nitrate concentration and net primary production (NPP). We found evidence of the spatially heterogeneous oceanographic conditions of the EEZ of Cuba, since the analysed variables fluctuated spatially with meridional and zonal gradients. Overall, the southern sectors were warmer and less productive than the northern ones, thereby showing the influence of the Caribbean Sea. The NWS showed the highest variability of the physical and biological variables analysed, given the convergence of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico waters and the Loop Current variability. The NES was strongly influenced by coastal conditions given its limited area and long coast line. Besides, a significant decadal increase in SSHA was linked to that in SST. Still, this warming trend was not reflected in the chl-a concentration and NPP trends, which is consistent with the fact that there has been no change over the studied 20 years in mean wind regime and MLD. Furthermore, the strong El Niño Southern Oscillation events of 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 appear to have considerably impacted the surface chl-a concentration, which was partially governed by the variability of the MLD.","","article","","212","","","Spatio-temporal variability of oceanographic conditions in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cuba","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796320301123","0924-7963","2020","103416","Journal of Marine Systems"

The onshore region of this basin was highly affected by extrusive and intrusive magmatism during the Upper Albian, and the relation of that event with the volcanic structures observed in the offshore sector has not been thoroughly characterized to date. This study aims to characterize the major extrusive and intrusive volcanic structures of the offshore portion of this basin, which is dominated by the Pernambuco Plateau, and its stratigraphic relations. A set of 143 2D multichannel seismic sections that cover the Pernambuco Plateau region are used to interpret the major tectono-stratigraphic sequences and describe the distribution of volcanoes, sills, vent complexes and related volcaniclastic sequences. The interpretations are supported by aeromagnetic and gravimetric geophysical surveys. Volcanoes are classified into two groups that differ in terms of their morphology: shield-like structures and cone-shaped volcanic structures. Sill intrusions are mainly identified beneath the volcanic structures and are characterized by high-amplitude reflectors with short extensions and abrupt terminations. Volcaniclastic sequences are found adjacent to the volcanoes and are characterized by high-amplitude, disrupted reflections with local chaotic configurations. Vent complexes are classified on the basis of their morphologies as either eye-shaped or crater-shaped. The volcanic features identified within the available seismic dataset are concentrated in two main areas: in the centre of the plateau and near its northeastern border. These two regions are host basement outer highs and are surrounded by hyper-extended continental crust, which forms the plateau itself. The extrusive and intrusive features described in the offshore region were formed during the post rift Cretaceous and Cenozoic intervals and point to the continuation of magmatic events after the rifting process. The findings presented in this report provide a better understanding of the magmatism on the northeastern passive margin of Brazil and can also be useful for future modelling of the Pernambuco Basin petroleum system.","","article","","70","","","Post-rift volcanic structures of the Pernambuco Plateau, northeastern Brazil","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981116300839","0895-9811","2016","251-267","Journal of South American Earth Sciences"

In general, the detection of hailfall is very uncertain. To overcome the constraints of scarcity and poor standardization of hail detection and monitoring systems, some relationships between hailstorm occurrence and synoptic, mesoscale or thermodynamic atmospheric characteristics have been proposed in different areas. Therefore, we analyzed meteorological fields at synoptic scale that are related to the formation of hailstorms in the study area, i.e., geopotential height at 500hPa, sea level pressure, and lapse-rate between 850 and 500hPa. These fields describe the state of the atmosphere at low and mid levels, and facilitate the evaluation of thermal and dynamic instability. Using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen estimator, we examined trends in the three fields during the period 1948–2015 and their spatial patterns, revealing an evolution toward synoptic environments that favor hail precipitation in the Mediterranean region.","","article","","198","","","Are meteorological conditions favoring hail precipitation change in Southern Europe?

The use of both technologies in transportation systems has seen a tremendous growth that resulted in transformation of the transportation industry. Various modes of transportation, such as new transit systems, metro rails, high-speed rails, connected and automated vehicles, autonomous trains, and other emerging transportation modes (hyperloop, e-scooters, hoverboards), still face many challenges, including but not limited to economic issues, energy efficiency, social adoption, data privacy, lack of regulatory standards, reliability, security, and ethical issues. The use of blockchain and AI technologies has the potential to fill the technology gaps in transportation systems and effectively address the existing challenges. The convergence of both technologies is likely to yield significant advantages and provide a common distributed platform for data sharing, reliability, and decision-making. The present study is focused on understanding both technologies and their convergence in various industrial domains with a specific emphasis on transportation systems.

Histology was used to screen for indicative nuclear features such as Cowdry type A bodies, pycnosis and chromatin margination. Although no Cowdry bodies were seen in any samples, individuals from all species except M. discors, P. subtriangulata and D. anus exhibited some of the other features (albeit sparsely and atypically) and 75 samples out of 885 examined were deemed worthy of further investigation. DNA was purified successfully from 68 of these 75 samples. DNA was also extracted from fresh oyster tissue for the host oyster positive control. All PCR primers used were designed to amplify small (<300 bp) DNA fragments as would be expected from formalin-fixed tissue. The efficacy of these primer pairs with histology samples was confirmed by detectable PCR amplification of oyster and viral DNA from a known OsHV-1 infected fixed and paraffin embedded histology sample of C. gigas. 68 of the 75 survey samples produced visible PCR amplification with the new Cg18SFor/Cg18SRev primer pair demonstrating successful host DNA extraction. This primer pair targets the C. gigas 18S ribosomal gene (product: 292 bp) and detectable PCR confirms both the successful extraction of DNA fragments large enough for amplification by the other primers and also the absence of PCR inhibitors. As little as 1 ng of C. gigas genomic DNA template generated a visible PCR product. Sequencing and alignment of the amplification product confirmed it as part of the C. gigas 18S rRNA gene. OsHV-1 DNA was sought by PCR in the 68 Cg18SFor/Cg18SRev PCR positives using two primer pairs: the extant C9/C10 (product: 196 bp), and the new pair OsHVDPFor/OsHVDPRev (product: 197 bp). As little as 1 pg and 10 pg (∼5000 and 50,000 OsHV-1 genome copies per PCR reaction) allowed these primer pairs, respectively, to detectably amplify a specific product.

The ship motion prediction is decomposed into lateral and longitudinal directions, and position probabilities are calculated along these two directions. A data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model based on a Gaussian Process is proposed to describe the lateral motion uncertainty, while the longitudinal uncertainty results from the uncertainty on the ship acceleration along the route. The parameters of the probabilistic models are derived off-line based on historic trajectory information provided by Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The model is then applied to predict the trajectory uncertainty in real time by iteratively updating the prior probability models based on new observed AIS data. Moreover, a sequential Cholesky decomposition algorithm is applied in this study to reduce the computational effort required by the Gaussian Process modelling. Three months of AIS data are used to train and test the proposed probabilistic trajectory prediction model.

To increase our limited knowledge of sperm whale occurrence patterns in remote and inaccessible locations of the North Pacific, we analyzed a five-year-long (June 2007–April 2012) acoustic data set recorded at Ocean Station PAPA (OSP; 50°N, 145°W) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Firstly, we assessed the sperm whale detection performance of the Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), and secondly, we investigated temporal patterns of sperm whale presence at OSP. The PAL proved highly efficient, with above 50% probability of detecting more than two sperm whales, a condition met for over 50% of the recordings. Results indicated that sperm whale clicks were recorded year-round, with a clear seasonal pattern. The number of detections during the summer months was approximately 70% higher compared to winter. An ambient noise analysis showed that differences in detection rates were likely not driven by seasonal changes in ambient noise levels. The average propagation range of sperm whale clicks ranged between 7 and 8 km between summer and winter, with slightly decreased detection distances observed in winter. Seasonal shifts in the intensity of the Alaska Current and the latitudinal oscillations of the North Pacific Transition Zone results in changes in water mixing, transport of nutrients and the concentration of prey such as squid, which likely drives sperm whale distribution.","","article","","150","","","Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) acoustic ecology at Ocean Station PAPA in the Gulf of Alaska – Part 1: Detectability and seasonality","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063718302577","0967-0637","2019","103047","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

In terms of human activity, Pyropia yezoensis (P. yezoensis) cultivation in Northern Jiangsu shoal of China has an impact on the scale of green tide. Compared with the same period in previous years, the early recycling of P. yezoensis cultivation rafts in 2021 provided more floating seed for green tide. The human activity intensity index in coastal cities in Jiangsu and Shandong provinces of China has been increasing for the past nine years, leading to large amounts of nutrients being released into seawater, providing green tide with the nutrients needed for growth. From the perspective of environmental changes, the sea surface temperature was higher in June and July in the SYS, which was favorable for green tide growth. The abundant solar radiation in May and July is conducive to photosynthesis of Ulva prolifera. The lower photosynthetically active radiation in August is conducive to reduce the effect of photoinhibition and promote algal growth.

In Ghana the Harmattan can be experienced from November to March, when the Harmattan replaces the dominant south westerly maritime Monsoon wind. The hypothesis of this study is that the majority of dust deposited in northern Ghana may not be from the original Harmattan source in the Bodélé Depression. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the origin of deposited dust in Tamale, Ghana. This is examined by comparing wind data, grain size distribution, mineralogical and geochemical data from dust samples deposited during the Harmattan and Monsoon seasons, and topsoil. This study shows that despite a clear difference between the wind directions in the Harmattan and Monsoon seasons in Tamale, northern Ghana, no distinct differences are observed between the mineral or elemental compositions of the bulk dust samples. Traces of minerals in the clay fraction of the Harmattan period dust may have their origin in the Bodélé Depression or other saline environments. The Harmattan dust deposited in Ghana shows only little resemblance to dust from the Chad basin and with Harmattan dust deposited in Niger. This study therefore suggests that the dust deposited during the Harmattan period in northern Ghana is not under significant influence of sediments from the Bodélé Depression.

In this paper, the processes behind such severe convective events and their local-scale impacts are investigated using reanalysis data, satellite-derived and observational products. The analysis of 95 MCS events from 2000 to 2020 revealed that they are triggered by low-level wind convergence and moisture advection from the Arabian Sea, Arabian Gulf and/or Red Sea. An equatorward displacement and strengthening of the subtropical jet also precondition the environment, as does the presence of a mid-level trough. The latter is generally part of a large-scale pattern of anomalies that are equivalent barotropic in nature, and therefore likely a response to tropical or subtropical forcing. At more local-scale, a drying of the mid-troposphere between 850 and 250 hPa typically by 50%, a reduction of the upper-level winds by about 5 m s−1, and an increase in the upper-tropospheric temperature on average by 2–3 K, are typically observed during MCS events.

Vegetation in areas in the high Northern Latitudes appear to be solely impacted by climatic influences. In other areas examined, the impact of anthropogenic effects is more direct. The pattern of NDVI anomalies over longer time periods appear to be driven by long-term climate change but most appear to be associated with climate variability on decadal and shorter time scales along with direct anthropogenic land cover conversions.

It also provides important guidelines on ML model selection as a global solution when building an attack predictive model.

TBT contamination of the local breeding waters was found to be responsible for failure to reproduce and for anomalies occurring in the shell calcification of adult oysters leading to stunted growth. On 17 January 1982, the French Ministry of the Environment issued a 3 month ban on the sale of marine anti-fouling paints with an organotin compound content exceeding 3%. The Ministerial ban was subsequently renewed and reinforced and ultimately converted into an enforcement decree transcribing an European Union directive into French law, in October 1992. The ban was the first official action in response to a growing awareness to the TBT-related pollution of some coastal areas and to its unacceptable impact on shellfish farming. These measures were adopted as soon as the first scientific evidence of a causal relationship was established between tributyltin and oyster shell anomalies. Since then numerous research studies have been conducted on the geochemical behavior of tributyltin, its ecotoxicity and on TBT-related risks presented by antifouling paints. The knowledge gained on this topic since 1982 reveals in particular that:•TBT is extremely toxic to aquatic organisms in general and to molluscs in particular for which the NOELs are below 1ngl-1(imposex, calcification anomalies),•Contamination levels can reach very high values in port areas, and even exceed no effect levels beyond which mollusc reproduction and growth are affected, in estuaries or semi-enclosed areas,•Contamination of breeding waters has a significant economic impact, jeopardizing the sustainable development of some highly exposed marine activities,•The ban on TBT use in antifouling paints for crafts under 25m represents an efficient way of reducing TBT inputs in coastal areas and restoring proper water quality,•The regulations adopted by many countries to ban or restrict TBT use on ships sailing along the coastline, have prompted manufacturers to develop less toxic paints. Fifteen years after TBT was first implicated as a major cause of coastal contamination, the issue no longer lies in finding out under which conditions TBT could still be used in antifouling paints, but rather in developing environmentally-harmless formulations. While the ban on TBT-based paints may be justified due to their harmful impact on coastal ecosystems, substitutes based on the release of biocides (copper oxide, pesticides…) also give rise to major concerns. Prevention of marine biofouling is not motivated merely by esthetics: it responds to economic needs and to navigation safety requirements. Protection of the ships while preserving the coastal ecosystems remains a major challenge for future research.","","article","","40","","","Tributyltin: case study of a chronic contaminant in the coastal environment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569198000362","0964-5691","1998","23-36","Ocean & Coastal Management"

This requires fast sensing of disturbances as well as efficient diagnosis methods. Conventional signal measuring techniques are usually intrusive, sensitive, with a low signal-to-noise ratio, and may show limited performance at incipient fault stages. Moreover, traditional machine learning (ML) diagnosis techniques based on handcrafted feature extraction methods suffer from limitations that can be overcome by deep learning (DL) with automatic feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, an online, non-intrusive method is proposed for fault diagnosis in a three-phase IM based on infrared imaging. The proposed method integrates three convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL models (Inception, Xception, and MobileNet) to identify IM health status, fault types, and stator Inter-turn faults (ITF) location and severity. Deep features obtained from these CNNs are merged through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) resulting in spatial-time-frequency features. This fusion reduces the input features’ size and improves diagnostic accuracy. Merged features’ length is further reduced using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where these reduced features are then used for classification. Compared to DL-based diagnosis methods introduced in previous work, the proposed method shows superior performance. First, it uses the IR images directly without the need for clustering and segmentation steps, thus saving time and effort. Moreover, ensembled DL is applied via combining the three CNNs benefits altogether rather than applying an individual DL method. Finally, unlike the huge features’ number exhibited by previous studies, the proposed approach uses minimal features, thus reducing classification complexity and time while maintaining 100% classification accuracy.","","article","","8","","","Fault diagnosis for induction generator-based wind turbine using ensemble deep learning techniques","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484722018650","2352-4847","2022","12787-12798","Energy Reports"

In order to assess the accuracy with which satellite-derived snow extent datasets capture the dynamic melt period (1 April–31 July), SCD datasets derived from the weekly NOAA snow chart record (1979–2004), daily IMS product (2000–2004), passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperatures (1979–2004), and Ku-band QuikSCAT scatterometer data (2000–2004) were assessed against in situ measurements across the Canadian Arctic (north of 60°). The higher resolution IMS and QSCAT datasets showed the best ability to capture spatial variability in spring SCD over the Canadian Arctic, followed by the NOAA and PMW datasets. The poorer performance of the PMW was anticipated because of documented difficulties monitoring snow cover over forested and mountainous terrain. Both the IMS and the NOAA datasets exhibited positive biases of ∼22–26 days which can be related to elevation effects and frequent cloud cover. The NOAA dataset was unable to capture interannual variability in spring snow cover over the central Canadian Arctic tundra region (66–74° N, 80–120° W) while the PMW was able to capture a significant fraction of the observed variability. This fact, combined with anomalous snow-cover temperature responses in the NOAA data further reinforces the conclusions of Wang et al.

All meteotsunami events during 2018 were identified and analyzed at the RDP estuary, and the maximum wave height observed was 0.78 m. The atmospheric conditions during the analyzed events were investigated, showing that the presence of atmospheric cold fronts and atmospheric gravity waves seem to happen simultaneously with meteotsunami events. From sea-level observations gathered at the estuary it was inferred that the meteotsunamis could be driven by atmospheric forcings propagating (i) mainly from SE to NW (the meteotsunami would be driven along the estuary from the outer to the upper RDP, and the Proudman resonance mechanism could explain its amplification), (ii) predominantly from SW to NE (the meteotsunami would be simultaneously generated at different locations of the RDP estuary), or (iii) the meteotsunami could be generated in waters of the continental shelf, to get into the RDP estuary, and then freely propagates from the outer to the upper RDP (in this case the Proudman resonance mechanism would not explain the amplification within the estuary). It is important to mention that the results of the present investigation are biased to the high-period band of meteotsunamis because the sampling interval (20 min, for most locations) is rather large to allow the study of the whole meteotsunami frequency band.","","article","","277","","","Meteotsunamis at the Río de la Plata estuary","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771422003225","0272-7714","2022","108064","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science"

In order to keep the recognition system robust in various underwater environments, this work proposes an adaptive generalized recognition system — AGNet (Adaptive Generalized Network). By converting fixed wavelet parameters into fine-grained learnable parameters, AGNet learns the characteristics of underwater sound at different frequencies. Its flexible and fine-grained design is conducive to capturing more background acoustic information (e.g., background noise, underwater transmission channel). To utilize the implicit information in wavelet spectrograms, AGNet adopts the convolutional neural network with parallel convolution attention modules as the classifier. Experiments reveal that our AGNet outperforms all baseline methods on several underwater acoustic datasets, and AGNet could benefit more from transfer learning. Moreover, AGNet shows robust performance against various interference factors.","","article","","265","","","Adaptive ship-radiated noise recognition with learnable fine-grained wavelet transform","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801822019096","0029-8018","2022","112626","Ocean Engineering"

Firstly, the ship's actions are identified based on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Secondly, the uncertainty of ship action patterns is analyzed by regarding the target ships as velocity obstacles. Then, the collision risk model is utilized to assess the collision risk level based on the uncertainty in the non-linear velocity obstacles algorithm considering responsibility.

In general, the annual mean O3 concentration is 2.35ppbv lower in the downtown than at suburban due to higher NOx pollution levels correlated with heavy traffic. At both sites, O3 shows a distinct seasonality with the spring maximum and the winter minimum, while the minimum concentration of NOx appears in summertime. Besides the chemical processes of O3 sensitivity in the daytime and the NOx titration at night, meteorological conditions also play an essential role in these monthly and diurnal variations. The ozone weekend effect that can be attributed to the weekly routine of human activities is observed in the urban atmosphere of Nanjing as well, with O3 concentrations 2.09ppbv higher and NOx concentrations 6.20ppbv lower on weekends than on weekdays. The chemical coupling of NO, NO2 and O3 is investigated to show that the OX-component (O3 and NO2) partitioning point occurs at about 35ppbv for NOx, with O3 being the dominant form at lower levels and NO2 dominating at higher levels. And it is also discovered that the level of OX is made up of two contributions, including the regional contribution affected by regional background O3 level and the local contribution correlated with the level of primary pollution. The diurnal peak of regional contribution appears 2–5h after the peak of local contribution, implying that OX in Nanjing might prominently affected by the pollutants from a short distance. The highest regional contribution and the second highest local contribution lead to the spring peak of O3 observed in Nanjing, whereas the highest local contribution and the moderate regional contribution make the O3 concentrations in summer higher than those in autumn and winter. Our results reveal the important environment impacts from meteorological conditions and human activities in the YRD region, and can help to understand O3 pollution in these polluted areas by just using the conventional observations.","","article","","551-552","","","Temporal characterization and regional contribution to O3 and NOx at an urban and a suburban site in Nanjing, China","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716302583","0048-9697","2016","533-545","Science of The Total Environment"

However, the presence of REEs in typical regional soils has yet to be studied. Given the potential health implications of such soil contamination, it is vital to study the characteristics, spatial distribution, and pollution level of REEs caused by e-waste dismantling as well as determine the influencing mechanism. This study focused on Guiyu Town as an example site, which is a typical e-waste dismantling base. From the site, 39 topsoil samples of different types were collected according to grid distribution points. Soil profiles were also collected in the dismantling and non-dismantling areas. The REE characteristic parameters showed that the REE distribution was abnormal and was affected by multiple factors. The results of the integrated pollution index showed that approximately 61.5% of soil samples were considered to be lightly polluted. Spatial distribution and correlation analysis showed that hot spots of REE-polluted soil coincided with known, main pollution sources. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation (p ≤0.05) between the REE concentration and the distance from the pollution source. E-waste disassembly and recycling greatly affect the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding soil as well as downward migration areas. In the disassembly area, REE accumulated more easily in the surface layer (0–20 cm). Geographical detector results showed that distance factor was the main contribution factor for both light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth element (HREE) (q = 34.59% and 53.33%, respectively). REE distribution in soil was nonlinear enhanced by different factors. Taken together, these results showed that e-waste disassembling and recycling not only directly affected the spatial distribution of REEs, but that their distribution was also affected by land use type and soil properties.","","article","","309","","","Potential hot spots contaminated with exogenous, rare earth elements originating from e-waste dismantling and recycling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749122009319","0269-7491","2022","119717","Environmental Pollution"

The MM5-CAMx modeling system was applied in the Eastern Mediterranean in high spatial and temporal resolution for the period 23 to 31 August 2007, forced by biomass burning emission fluxes from the Global Fire Emissions Database (version 3.0), in day-to-day temporal and 0.1° spatial variability from the Global Fire Assimilation System. Enhancements of the CO and NOx concentrations over almost the entire modeling domain were estimated due to the biomass burning, which were more pronounced over the burnt areas and maximum over the Peloponnesus forest fires. The domain-wide near surface mean concentration was higher by +6% for CO and +11% for NOx because of the biomass burning. The near surface O3 values were reduced over the fire hot spots but increased over the greater part of the modeling domain. On the 26th August 2007, the maximum O3 concentrations reduction of about 12ppb (i.e. −34%) was calculated over the Peloponnesus fires while the highest O3 increase of about 27ppb (i.e. +52%) was estimated over the sea at 500km downwind the Peloponnesus large forest fires. The process analysis revealed that on that day, the inclusion of the biomass burning emissions resulted in an enhancement of the daytime gas phase O3 production in the boundary layer in the Eastern Mediterranean and during some daytime hours in a change of the chemical regime from O3 destruction to O3 production. From 6 to 16 UTC, the O3 photochemistry in the boundary layer was VOC-sensitive close to the Peloponnesus fires, gradually changing to NOx-sensitive in the downwind fire plume. In the same period, the maximum impact on the oxidizing capacity of the boundary layer was an increase by 0.25ppt for OH and a reduction by 13ppt for HO2 mean concentrations over the Peloponnesus forest fires and an increase by 12ppt for HO2 in the downwind plume.","","article","","149","","","A modeling study of the impact of the 2007 Greek forest fires on the gaseous pollutant levels in the Eastern Mediterranean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809514002166","0169-8095","2014","1-17","Atmospheric Research"

IPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events, and produce reports. Many IPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack's content.

Their sensitivities to pollutants can be reflected by changes in assemblage, which can provide useful information about ecosystem health. This study aimed to investigate the impact of organic and inorganic pollutants on the benthic ecology of the Chennai coast, with a focus on the 2017 oil spill caused by the collision of two ships. Sediment samples collected from five distinct zones along the coast were analysed for pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Pb) and total organic carbon (TOC). The maximum concentrations of Cr (137 μg/g), Cd (6.93 μg/g) and Pb (34.2 μg/g), as well as TPH (84.3 μg/g) and PAHs (227 ng/g), were observed. A total of 47 species of foraminifera were identified in this study, of which 12 were morphologically abnormal. In the low-impact zone, the species diversity index (H′) was higher. TPH and PAH concentrations were positively associated with abnormal species. Pollution-resistant foraminifera species include Ammonia tepida, Elphidium discoidale, and Quinqueloculina lamarckiana, while opportunistic foraminifera include Pararotalia curryi, Nonionella stella, Rosalina globularis, and Spirillina vivipara. PAHs and heavy metals were adversely correlated with foraminiferal abundance, while TPH was positively correlated. To assess the response of the benthic ecosystem to hydrocarbon pollution, indices such as the Foraminiferal Index of Environmental Impact (FIEI), Exponential (H′bc) index and the Foraminiferal Abnormality Index (FAI) were used as environmental health proxies.

To overcome those limitations, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to learn the efficient adaptive gain-tuning strategy without human intuition behind since it does not require any prior knowledge about the dynamics of a ship or DPS.

Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a quantitative estimate of the amount of aerosol present in the atmosphere, and it can be used as a proxy for surface particulate matters. The AERONET is a network of ground-based sun photometers, providing globally AOD data. Long-term ground-based measurements from all point AERONET V3 Level 2.0 data at 10 sites in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region covering the countries of Turkey, Romania, Greece, Ukraine and Cyprus were used to determine spatial and temporal distribution of the selected aerosol parameters such as AOD at 440, 500, 870 nm (AOD440, AOD500, AOD870), Angstrom Exponent at 440–870 nm (AE440-870) and fine mode fraction at 500 nm (FMF500) for the period of 1999–2018. Since the combination of AOD, AE440-870 and FMF500 enables categorization of aerosol types, two different classification methods were compared in the region. The first method (M1) divides the aerosols into three categories (marine, desert dust and continental) using the parameters of AOD500 and FMF500 whereas the second method (M2) has five categorizations (marine, continental, biomass burning, desert dust, and mixed-type) using the parameters of AOD440 and AE440-870. The multiyear averaged AOD and AE spatiotemporal variability over the region was also presented at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° based on MERRA-2 reanalysis data. The results indicate that marine aerosol was the most predominant type in both methods while continental aerosol type was also obtained at a high rate over the region. The highest AOD occurred in summer, while lowest values were observed in winter. A high volume of fine-mode particles was observed during summer with higher AE values caused by carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning mainly observed at north-western part of the region. In contrast with that, coarse-mode particles, mainly dust, dominated with lower AE values during spring over the southern and eastern parts of the region.","","article","","11","","","Application of aerosol classification methods based on AERONET version 3 product over eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104220301677","1309-1042","2020","2226-2243","Atmospheric Pollution Research"

One of the most important attributes of a forest ecosystem is site productivity, an essential determinant of resource availability. Knowledge of site productivity is crucial for sustainable forest management because it is the basis for predictions of future forest growth and is fundamental to long-term planning in forestry. Models of forest dynamics allow us to better understand the functioning of forest ecosystems and to assess the provision of ecosystem services. However, discussions on the factors affecting forest growth are ongoing. Previous research has not clarified the influence of stand density on the height increment of trees. Consequently, this uncertainty leads to inconsistent predictions for stand growth and nonoptimal forest-management decisions. We aimed to analyse the effect of stand density on top height (TH) growth and the development of the TH growth model for Scots pine based on bitemporal ALS measurements. We applied repeated ALS observations from two acquisitions (2011, 2019) to fit a density-sensitive TH growth model. We found that stand density affected the TH growth of Scots pine. A higher stand density stimulated TH growth, particularly in productive sites showing a TH increment of about 10%. We demonstrated the usefulness of bitemporal ALS measurements for developing a TH growth model for Scots pine considering stand density. We found that the predictive accuracy of the TH increment increased when stand density was considered.","","article","","108","","","Assessment of the effect of stand density on the height growth of Scots pine using repeated ALS data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243422000897","1569-8432","2022","102763","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation"

Dendrochronological methods can be used to evaluate the effect of silvicultural treatments, providing precise data concerning growth rates, releases and suppressions. This information is essential to predict forest stand attributes and yields under different silvicultural management protocols. Sustainable silvicultural prescriptions are scarce for the evergreen Nothofagus betuloides forests in southern Patagonia. Therefore, accurate and detailed analyses of the response of N. betuloides to silvicultural trials could contribute to the development of the fundamentals of sustainable forestry. The objective of this study was to determine the radial growth response of N. betuloides to different thinning intensity levels using dendrochronological techniques and to assess the climatic influences on the thinning response. Thinnings from below were conducted in 1993 and 2000 in a young secondary forest that originated after a high-severity fire in 1949. Growth differences were evaluated considering ring widths, basal area increments, percentage of growth change and periodic annual increments. Growth-climate correlations were also explored. Thinning intensities showed differential effects on radial growth: heavy thinning treatments resulted in higher individual growth rates than the control treatment. Low density plots showed higher growth increments regardless of thinning intensity, suggesting that thinning intensity alone does not dictate the magnitude of growth releases. Radial growth rates were positively associated with warmer and less rainy summers, highlighting climatic conditions are an important driver of the thinning response. The effect of the first thinning was masked by the second intervention, indicating that this species reacts to intense interventions. These results indicate that it is possible to reduce the number of non-commercial thinnings and, consequently, the costs of the silvicultural system for this species. Moreover, this study highlights the usefulness of dendrochronological methods in providing accurate information for silvicultural purposes.","","article","","57","","","Radial growth responses to thinning and climate in native Nothofagus betuloides forests in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1125786518301760","1125-7865","2019","125625","Dendrochronologia"

In general, each one of these simply formulated indicators describes the magnitude, duration, severity, or spatial coverage extent of drought. Almost all of them are based on meteorological and hydrological variables, such as precipitation, especially rainfall, temperature, streamflow, soil moisture, reservoir storage, and groundwater level. Several of them can be synthesized into a single indicator on a quantitative scale, often called a drought index. Although drought indices can provide ease of implementation, the scientific and operational meaning of an index value may raise questions, such as how each indicator is combined or weighted for an overall index derivation and how an arbitrary index value relates to hydrometeorological and statistical characteristics of droughts.

The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities’ resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards. Finally, we recommend feasible pathways to overcome present risks and challenges in order to optimize the numerous opportunities offered by digitalization in support of climate change adaptation initiatives.","","article","","53","","","Assessing the Potentials of Digitalization as a Tool for Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Development in Urban Centres","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670719307267","2210-6707","2020","101888","Sustainable Cities and Society"

It discusses the development of an affordable and accurate moisture probe that has been designed to be easily assembled by the builder or owner of a straw bale building from items readily available in the United Kingdom (UK). The probe uses a timber block inserted into the wall, relying upon the measurable moisture variances of the timber and relating this to the surrounding straw. The probes are designed to be used in pairs of varying length, taking measurements at different depths to give an estimate of the moisture gradient through the wall. In order to properly calibrate this device, a full set of sorption and desorption isotherms were established for both Oat and Wheat straw and three different timber species. The results from an environmental chamber have been compared to readings from specimens of the new probe installed in a straw bale house in the south west of the UK. The results were found to be consistent, to within 2%, with the laboratory findings.","","article","","46","","","Development of a cost effective probe for the long term monitoring of straw bale buildings","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132310002155","0360-1323","2011","156-164","Building and Environment"

These three mobile laboratories, collectively called SMARTLabs (cf. http://smartlabs.gsfc.nasa.gov/, Surface-based Mobile Atmospheric Research & Testbed Laboratories) comprise a suite of surface remote sensing and in-situ instruments that are pivotal in providing high spectral and temporal measurements, complementing the collocated spatial observations from various Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites. A satellite-surface perspective and scientific findings, drawn from the BASE-ASIA (2006) field deployment as well as a series of ongoing 7-SEAS (2010–13) field activities over northern Southeast Asia are summarized, concerning (i) regional properties of aerosols from satellite and in-situ measurements, (ii) cloud properties from remote sensing and surface observations, (iii) vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds, and (iv) regional aerosol radiative effects and impact assessment. The aerosol burden over Southeast Asia in boreal spring, attributed to biomass burning, exhibits highly consistent spatial and temporal distribution patterns, with major variability arising from changes in the magnitude of the aerosol loading mediated by processes ranging from large-scale climate factors to diurnal meteorological events. Downwind from the source regions, the tightly coupled-aerosol–cloud system provides a unique, natural laboratory for further exploring the micro- and macro-scale relationships of the complex interactions. The climatic significance is presented through large-scale anti-correlations between aerosol and precipitation anomalies, showing spatial and seasonal variability, but their precise cause-and-effect relationships remain an open-ended question. To facilitate an improved understanding of the regional aerosol radiative effects, which continue to be one of the largest uncertainties in climate forcing, a joint international effort is required and anticipated to commence in springtime 2013 in northern Southeast Asia.","","article","","78","","","From BASE-ASIA toward 7-SEAS: A satellite-surface perspective of boreal spring biomass-burning aerosols and clouds in Southeast Asia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231012011636","1352-2310","2013","20-34","Atmospheric Environment"

On September 4 of 2007, July 25–31 and September 5–8 of 2010, three large debris flows took place in Tianmo gully, a left-bank tributary of Parlung River, southeast Tibetan Plateau. The debris flows blocked the river, and a section of highway 450m long including a bridge 76m long were destroyed by the subsequent outburst flood. This paper, based on post-event investigations, witness accounts, news reports and satellite image interpretation, systematically analyses the geo-environments, climate conditions and sources of these debris flow events. Their differences in flow process, surge numbers and velocity suggest that they resulted from different geohazard processes, cascades and initiation mechanisms. The 2007 debris flow originated from a bare rock/moraine collapse next to the cirque due to strong alternation of wet and dry conditions. The mass moved down the gully with velocity of 30–40m/s estimated by back-calculation using superelevation and run-up. It entrained moraine, avalanched snow-ice and water from the channel, and transformed into high-speed debris flow, crossing the Parlung River and finally depositing onto the highway. The other two events in July and September of 2010 initiated from two channel-bank landslides triggered by melt-water and concentrated rainfall, which dammed the channel. The subsequent landslide dam failure generated debris flows over several days, with velocities of 12–14m/s, that temporally blocked Parlung River. The initiation mechanisms of most large debris flows recorded in Parlung region are similar to the events in Tianmo gully, originating either from rock/moraine avalanches or from the collapse of a landslide dam. This implies that the periglacial degradation of bedrock and moraine is the key process to be monitored and assessed under climate warming. The paper applies the geohazard mechanisms and cascade to hazard monitoring in order to protect the existing Sichuan-Tibet highway and the forthcoming railway.","","article","","233","","","Geohazard cascade and mechanism of large debris flows in Tianmo gully, SE Tibetan Plateau and implications to hazard monitoring","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013795217308438","0013-7952","2018","172-182","Engineering Geology"

A decadal (2/2000-2/2010) high resolution gridded dataset was compiled using MODIS TERRA level-2 data. The general aerosol optical depth (AOD550nm) weekly patterns were defined at a 0.1°×0.1° resolution using the weekly cycle index (WCI). To remove episodic dust transport events, two different aerosol flags, employing fine mode ratio (FMR550nm) and AOD550nm data, were applied diagnostically. The region of interest is Central Europe, which is an area with a recorded aerosol weekly cycle. The main body of the positive (midweek peak) weekly cycle plume extends over the central part of Central Europe with the WCI levels gradually lowering until the weekly cycle becomes negative (weekend peak) when moving away from the main body of the plume. There is not a clear connection between the WCI patterns and topography while there is a correlation between a positive weekly cycle in summer and population density. The use of the two aerosol flags does not change the WCI patterns giving an indication of the continental character of the plume. A clear Monday minimum appears over the regions which are characterized by a high positive WCI. Monday shifts to Tuesday when moving to the East which is indicative of an aerosol transport from the dominating westerly wind flow. The investigation of the WCI and the average percent departure (APD) for the day of weekly maximum/minimum, for 22 stations examined in previous weekly cycle studies, reveals that the weekly cycle is positive and statistically significant for only a few stations situated in France, Germany, Czech Republic and Belgium. The 1°×1° MODIS TERRA data in most cases can give an indication of the local aerosol weekly cycle strength and phase. It is shown here that the satellite derived day of the weekly maximum and minimum is in general in line with results from ground-based studies; however, the weekly variability does not agree with the variability shown in these studies. The investigation of the seasonal WCI and maximum/minimum day patterns reveals that the signal of the positive weekly cycle plume appearing over Central Europe is very strong during summer. The day of maximum AOD550nm ranges between Wednesday, Thursday and Friday becoming Saturday for the Eastern regions. The day of minimum is Monday for the central parts becoming Tuesday for the Eastern regions. This summer shift of the day of maximum and minimum for regions situated in the Central and Eastern Central Europe is an indication of the transport of the aerosols from the dominating westerly wind flow. Parts of the summer positive weekly cycle plume can be observed in spring and autumn.","","article","","107","","","A high resolution satellite view of the aerosol weekly cycle variability over Central Europe","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809512000063","0169-8095","2012","145-160","Atmospheric Research"

The key environmental components of these ecosystems consist of vegetation and the underlying permafrost. The surface energy balance and, consequently, the ground surface temperature (GST) and ground thermal regime (GTR) can be influenced by vegetation, as is well known in Arctic areas. The interactions between vegetation, GST, GTR and their potential ecological implications in Antarctica have only recently begun to develop. This paper aims to contribute towards closing the gap of knowledge of these interactions. It does so by considering different spatial (intra-site and inter-site variability) and temporal (seasonal versus annual) scales with reference to dry and wet Antarctic cryptogamic tundra. For this reason, two sites and seven plots (bare ground versus vegetated ground) were instrumented and monitored in Victoria Land (continental Antarctica) to measure the ground temperature at different depths during the summer, as well as during one complete year. Our results demonstrate for the first time for continental Antarctica that vegetation provides an insulating effect with a net cooling effect on the GST, varying with the vegetation type, structure, coverage and thickness. Independently of the GST, the soil thermal characteristics constitute the driving factor in determining the thickness of the active layer. We discuss potential future implications of changes in the vegetation, ground thermal regime and permafrost in a climate change scenario, with reference to the activation of feedbacks through changes in the energy balance, in the permafrost conditions and controls over ecosystem C storage and fluxes.","","article","","151","","","Influence of vegetation on the ground thermal regime in continental Antarctica","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706109001268","0016-7061","2009","215-223","Geoderma"

Also examined is the difference between the geographical distributions of these parameters in the El Nino period in 1998 and in the corresponding normal period in 1999. During the 1997–98 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 12% and 36%, respectively, during the El Nino period and during the La Nina period decrease by 22% and 5%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding normal periods. Similarly, during the 2002–2003 ENSO event, the number of flashes and average flash rate increase by 28% and 5% during the El Nino period in 2002 as compared to the corresponding normal period. The contrast in lightning activity between the El Nino and La Nina periods is more pronounced in Southeast Asia than in South Asia because of the southeastward shift in the convection activity during the ENSO events. In both regions, however, monthly variations of both total number of flashes and average flash rate are almost parallel to that of surface temperature. Although, the inverse relationship between the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and El Nino broke down in 1997–98, the relationship between the El Nino and lightning maintains its normal increasing trend, indicating that the lightning activity is more sensitive to the convective activity than to rainfall on seasonal time scale. The total number of flashes and aerosol loading increase in the break‐period regime as compared to the monsoonal regime. The number of flash days in both ENSO events is higher in the EL Nino phase and lower in the La Nina phase as compared to their normal values in the subsequent years. Enhancement of lightning activity is mostly concentrated over land areas. Our results show that although diurnal variations in lightning activity can be related to the variations in surface temperature, convective adjustment induced by the corresponding ENSO phase needs to be considered for explaining the lightning activity variations on these longer time scales.","","article","","118","","","Variability of lightning activity in South/Southeast Asia during 1997–98 and 2002–03 El Nino/La Nina events","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809512001792","0169-8095","2012","84-102","Atmospheric Research"

The satellite-based SD estimates are adjusted against in situ observations via statistical interpolation to reduce the potentially large biases, prior to being assimilated using an ensemble Kalman filter. A customized, rule-based direct insertion approach is developed to assimilate the two SCF datasets. Our results indicate that considerable overall improvement on snow prediction can be achieved via assimilating the bias-adjusted satellite SD estimates; however, the improvement does not always translate into improvements in streamflow prediction. Assimilating the standard MODIS SCF is found to have little impact on snow and streamflow predictions, while assimilating the interpreted SCF estimates, which have reduced cloud coverage and improved snow mapping accuracy, has resulted in the most consistent improvements on snow and streamflow predictions across the study domain.","","article","","54","","","Assimilating satellite-based snow depth and snow cover products for improving snow predictions in Alaska","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170813000304","0309-1708","2013","208-227","Advances in Water Resources"

Such facilities have been widely used in numerous studies about land management and planning. Considering the current lack of relevant overviews, it may be useful to evaluate the utilization paths of GEE and its impact on the scientific community. For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted using the PRISMA methodology based on 343 articles published from 2020 to 2022 in high-impact scientific journals, selected from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After an overview of the publishing context, an analysis of the frequency of satellite features, processing methods, applications are carried out, and a special attention is given to the COVID-19 studies. Finally, the geographical distribution of the reviewed articles is evaluated, and the citation impact metrics is analysed. On a bibliometric approach, 90 journals published articles on GEE in the reference period (January 2020 to April 2022), and this large number of journals reveals the multidisciplinary application of GEE platform as well as the interest of publishers towards this topic of relevance for the international scientific community. The results of the meta-analysis following the systematic review showed that: (i) the Landsat 8 was the most widely-used satellite (25%); (i) the non-parametric classification methods, mainly Random Forest, were the most recurrent algorithms (31%); and (iii) the water resources assessment and prediction were the most common methodological applications (22%). A low number of articles about COVID-19, in spite of the planetary importance of the pandemic effects. The reviewed articles were geographically distributed among 86 countries, China, United States, and India accounting for the large number. ‘Remote Sensing’ and ‘Remote Sensing of Environment’ were the leading journals in the citation impact metrics, while the Random Forest method and the agriculture-related applications being the mostly cited. It is expected that these results might change over the mid to long term, due to fast progress in environmental and spatial information technologies, although currently our findings may be worthwhile and useful for assessing the current global deployment of GEE platform.","","article","","29","","","What is going on within google earth engine?

Exposure to DCOIT (0.2 to 151 μg L−1) for 120 h triggered oxidative stress in both tissues (through the modulation of GPX, GST, GSH and GR), which led to damage of membrane lipids (increase of LPO and reduction of the NRRT). DCOIT increased histopathological pathologies in gills, such as necrosis, lymphocyte infiltration and epithelial desquamation. This study showed that short term exposure to environmental concentrations of DCOIT causes negative effects on C. brasiliana at biochemical, physiological, and histological levels.

SDA of BDS is the problem of analyzing, modeling and extracting information from huge amounts of data that continuously come from several sources in real time through com- putational aware solutions. Among others, CBM for Rail Transportation is one of the most challenging SDA problems, consisting of the implementation of a predictive maintenance system for evaluating the future status of the monitored assets in order to reduce risks related to failures and to avoid service disruptions. The challenge is to collect and analyze all the data streams that come from the numerous on-board sensors monitoring the assets. This paper deals with the problem of CBM applied to the condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of train axle bearings based on sensors data collection, with the purpose of maximizing their Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In particular we propose a novel algorithm for CBM based on SDA that takes advantage of the Online Support Vector Regression (OL-SVR) for predicting the RUL. The novelty of our proposal is the heuristic approach for optimizing the trade-off between the accuracy of the OL-SVR models and the computational time and resources needed in order to build them.

The DV-Hop positioning scheme is a kind of range-free positioning scheme, which has been favored by researchers in recent years. However, the original DV-Hop scheme faces the shortcoming of low positioning precision and stability. To ameliorate the positioning capability of the DV-Hop, an enhanced DV-Hop scheme based on the spring model and reliable beacon node set has been presented in this paper. Firstly, the relationship between nodes in the network is abstracted as a spring model, and the distance between unknown nodes and beacon nodes is corrected by comprehensively considering the influence of each beacon node from the physical phenomenon of force vector decomposition. After that, based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, the reliable beacon nodes with smaller distance deviation to the unknown node are picked out to compute the unknown node coordinates, rather than all beacon nodes participating in the calculation. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on distance accuracy and positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed positioning scheme outperforms better than original DV-Hop and other existing improved schemes under different scenarios.","","article","","209","","","An Enhanced DV-Hop Positioning Scheme Based on Spring Model and Reliable Beacon Node Set","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128622001153","1389-1286","2022","108926","Computer Networks"

Fog water samples, taken at sea and throughout a network of land based stations were also analyzed for MMHg and THg. Vertical profiles indicate that midwater regions around 300 m are associated with concentration maxima in methylated species. Cyclonic mesoscale eddies were shown to be strong sources of the gaseous mercury species to the lower atmosphere and a likely source of these species to fog. Calculated evasive flux of Hg0 and DMHg were greatest in these regions (34 and 11 pmol m−2 d−1, respectively), whereas anticyclonic eddies support little or no sea-air evasion. Incubation experiments showed that DMHg is stable over short time scales at natural seawater pH (7.8–8.2) but degrades rapidly to MMHg at low pH. Demethylation of only a small percent of the evading DMHg, on acidic marine aerosols associated with fog condensation nuclei, can account for over 100% of the MMHg observed in fog. The surface microlayer, enriched in MMHg (by 30 ×), may also contribute to sea-air flux through aerosol production. Neither shelf sediments nor oxygen minimum zones appear to be a major source of methylated mercury in the California Current.","","article","","151","","","The distribution and speciation of mercury in the California current: Implications for mercury transport via fog to land","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064518301152","0967-0645","2018","77-88","Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography"

The legislation on these emissions has been undergoing constant updates, increasingly incisive on this subject. The imposed reductions in pollutant gases are obvious and demanding, which also demands the use of sustainable energy sources, where biofuels appear as a viable and immediate solution. This study will provide an overview of the utilization of biodiesel in actual on-road driving conditions. The current information analyzes the evaluation of the B15 (15% biodiesel in diesel) use on automobile fleets to achieve this goal through a completely practical approach. To accomplish this goal, it was used monitoring data from car fleets that included both cars and trucks fuelled by conventional diesel and a mixture with 15% of biodiesel during comparable time periods. The 15% biodiesel addition to fuel will result in some differences in fuel consumption for all the evaluated automobile fleets, corresponding to increases or decreases of maximum of 2%, which variance is much lower that the observed between vehicles with different drivers and operation activities. Due to all the benefits a renewable fuel offers, particularly in terms of the reduction of CO2 emissions and decrease in reliance on fossil fuels, the increase in biodiesel blends can be confirmed as making a positive environmental contribution even when a small average increase in fuel consumption is verified.","","article","","13","","","Using B15 in vehicles on real on-road circumstances - A case study","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666790823000216","2666-7908","2023","100616","Cleaner Engineering and Technology"

This intensification will increase the risk of floods, soil erosion, and droughts in the world's dry regions. Exploring the precipitation's irregularity and the daily precipitation concentration in Central Asia (CA) has significant implications for regional agricultural development and ecosystem services. However, the irregularity of precipitation was poorly understood throughout the entire CA due to the sparse meteorological observations. Using the daily Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP-V2.2) from 1979 to 2016 across CA, this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of the daily precipitation concentration index (CI) and the precipitation diversity and analyzed their attributes and implications. The results demonstrated that the CI was significantly negatively correlated with the precipitation frequency and amount. The distribution of the precipitation frequency diversity (Hfre) and the precipitation amount diversity (Hamount) showed an opposite pattern with the CI, implying that the low Hfre and Hamount values were corresponding to a high precipitation concentration. The high CI values were found in the Tarim Basin and near the Aral Sea, revealing a strong irregularity in precipitation. The decrease regarding the light precipitation frequency or increase in the torrential precipitation frequency generated the increasing precipitation frequency diversity, corresponding to a widespread significant reduction of the CI in CA. The decreased CI and increased precipitation diversity over past decades were likely related to the warming phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The shift from light to extreme precipitation will trigger the risk of flooding and soil erosion and bring about big challenges for water resources management in the arid and semi-arid regions.","","article","","241","","","Spatiotemporal variability of the precipitation concentration and diversity in Central Asia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809519312013","0169-8095","2020","104954","Atmospheric Research"

It covers 35,000 km2, it is 320 km long and 230 km wide at the mouth. The Río de la Plata drains the second largest basin in South America with an average discharge of 22,000 m3 s−1. The processes associated with the interaction of the fresh river water and the saline shelf water and tidal stirring generate a turbidity front in the outer region, which is clearly defined in the satellite images as a strong gradient in reflectance and a sharp change in water color. We use a 4 yr span of NOAA-AVHRR daily images, from September 1986 to August 1990, to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the turbidity front. Channels 1 and 2 (visible and near-infrared) are used to digitize the fronts, and channel 4 and sea surface temperature are used as complementary information for cloud detection. From a total of 2578 images, 1274 daytime images allowed us to determine 333 positions of the front. This information is used to estimate the distribution of the frontal density, a probabilistic measure of frontal occurrence. Monthly, seasonal and annual analyses were performed. The relation of the turbidity front patterns to bathymetry, tidal dynamics, river discharge and winds were investigated. A comparison between the frontal density distribution and stratification parameters is presented. The results show a high degree of variability of the frontal distribution at the northern coast of the estuary. In this region, the frontal position varies between 57°W and 54°12′W. The westernmost location occurs in the summer months, which is coincident with minimum river discharge, predominance of easterly winds and minimum occurrence of southwesterlies. The easternmost location occurs during the spring, with strong winds from the southwest. At the southern coast the modal position of the front coincides with the 5 m isobath, although great variations to this position have been observed during years of large river discharge. The fall and winter are seasons of maximum river discharge. During these periods there is a bimodal frontal distribution with maximum values of frontal density at the northern area of Bay of Samborombón and south of Montevideo, and higher variability in the center of the river.","","article","","16","","","Study of the Río de la Plata turbidity front, Part 1: spatial and temporal distribution","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0278434395000712","0278-4343","1996","1259-1282","Continental Shelf Research"

First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness and climate variables over five time periods. Second, we subjected the data to correlation, regression, and residual analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and different climate variables. Third, we extracted trends and correlation results by primary land cover types for each climate zone. Our study was focused at the global scale, and findings indicate that the largest decreasing trend of vegetation greenness and grasslands occurred in the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and in parts of South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and south and northeast Asia. In particular, the cold climatic zones of forest (36.6%), cropland (36.6%), and grassland (14.1%) suffered significant decline in vegetation greenness. Anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for declining vegetation greenness particularly in northern Africa, central and western Asia. However, residual analysis shows an increase in vegetation greenness in some parts of western Europe, southern Australia, and the northern part of South America. The study also identified temperature and precipitation as the main factors responsible for controlling vegetation growth. Hot-spot areas with the largest temperature increases were found in the Amazon, Central America, southern Greenland, east Africa, south-east Asia, and other areas.

However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.","","article","","208","","","Assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern Gulf of Mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718300099","0034-4257","2018","63-81","Remote Sensing of Environment"

The maximum magnitudes of the air temperature trends are in good agreement with maximum warm advection by currents of the Gulf Stream system, while modest warm advection by currents corresponds to weak positive and even negative magnitudes of the temperature trends. Consequently, the magnitude of the temperature trends in the annual variation is modulated by warm advection by currents of the Gulf Stream system which contains a half-yearly component and is determined by natural factors.

For complex physical systems, effective digital integration can often be achieved by means of a system of aggregated digital twins coupled with a services network. Designing such a system of digital twins and services involves a daunting array of options and considerations. This paper presents a design framework that facilitates systematic, effective decisions when designing a system of digital twins to integrate the data from a complex physical system. The design framework is arranged in six steps: 1) needs and constraints analysis, 2) physical system decomposition, 3) services allocation, 4) performance and quality considerations, 5) implementation considerations and 6) verification and validation. The design framework works with a general reference architecture that combines a digital twin aggregation hierarchy with a service-oriented architecture. This reference architecture allows for the separation of concerns, computational load distribution, incremental development and modular software design. The paper considers the merits of the design framework using two illustrative case studies, i.e. a heliostat field and a smart city.

However, most technologies to date are considered blue sky concepts, with little robust techno-economic analysis demonstrating profitability. The paper begins by providing a comprehensive review of Blue Growth and multi-use in Blue Growth; both in policy as well as the wide range of current technologies, including ocean energy, offshore wind energy, offshore aquaculture and desalination. The Maribe H2020 project provides the vehicle for the research element of the paper. The major contribution is a new methodology for selecting, filtering, developing and ranking business propositions for multiple-use of space (MUS) and multi-use platforms (MUP). Application of the method for the first time identified three case studies where Blue Growth combination projects can be economically viable, with attractive internal rate of return (IRRs). Results presented for the case studies report standard investment metrics and show the relative contribution of each product (energy, food, water) to the system profitability, as well as socio-economic impact. Existing companies were fully engaged in the process. Co-creation between sector experts and industry led to both improved business value propositions and robust assessment of investment readiness. In contrast to the presumption that large scale platforms are commercially attractive, the highest ranking case study companies required smaller capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operated in niche subsectors. In conclusion, the positive economic performance of the case studies should provide confidence for the EC as well as investors that MUS and MUP have viable economic futures leading towards commercialisation. The macro and micro assessment methods will be particularly useful in other Blue Economy contexts and in other multiple product contexts.","","article","","107","","","Feasibility of investment in Blue Growth multiple-use of space and multi-use platform projects; results of a novel assessment approach and case studies","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032119300589","1364-0321","2019","338-359","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews"

This paper compiles terrestrial and marine proxy data from sites along the northeastern Pacific margins and proposes that they indicate 1) suppressed ENSO conditions during the middle Holocene between ∼8000 and 4000 cal BP with a North Pacific that generally resembled a La Niña-like or more negative PDO phase and 2) a climate transition between ∼4200 and 3000 cal BP that appears to be the teleconnected expression to a more modern-like ENSO Pacific. Compared to modern day conditions, the compiled data suggest that during the middle Holocene, the Aleutian Low was generally weaker during the winter and/or located more to the west, while the North Pacific High was stronger during the summer and located more to the north. Coastal upwelling off California was more enhanced during the summer and fall but suppressed during the spring. Oregon and California sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were cooler. The Santa Barbara Basin had an anomalous record, suggesting warmer SSTs. Late Holocene records indicate a more variable, El Niño-like, and more positive PDO Pacific. The Aleutian Low became more intensified during the winter and/or located more to the east. The North Pacific High became weaker and/or displaced more to the south. Coastal upwelling off California intensified during the spring but decreased during the fall.

This paper presents research on a subsea wellhead positioning process for the marking of seabed positions and its subsequent as-built verification. The results indicate that the ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic technique can provide static positioning accuracy and precision comparable to those of a long-baseline method (LBL) and significantly reduces the time and cost of the offshore project. The new approach was tested at different stages of the process. First, an innovative offset transformation method, which increases the precision of alignments, was proposed, followed by a step-by-step procedure for determining the positions of marker buoys on the seabed based on spin tests and cardinal heading calibration. Finally, the M−estimation method, which has not yet been applied in subsea engineering, was implemented and proved to be a suitable alternative to the ordinary least squares method.","","article","","195","","","Subsea wellhead spud-in marking and as-built position estimation method based on ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224122004134","0263-2241","2022","111155","Measurement"

However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While TRW was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.","","article","","449","","","Minimum winter temperature reconstruction from average earlywood vessel area of European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018216001486","0031-0182","2016","520-530","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

Using these data, several regional models for TA retrievals based on practical salinity (S) have been developed. Broad-scale seasonal or interannual variations, however, are not well resolved in these models and existing data are highly seasonally biased. This study reports findings from the first long duration deployment of a new, commercially available TA titrator aboard a research vessel and the continuous underway surface TA measurements produced. The instrument, operated on seven East Coast USA cruises during six months in 2017 and for two months in 2018 on the summertime East Coast Ocean Acidification survey (ECOA-2), collected a total of nearly 11,000 surface TA measurements. Data from these efforts, along with a newly synthesized set of more than 11,000 regional surface TA observations, are analyzed to re-examine distributions of TA and S along the United States East Coast. Overall, regional distributions of S and TA generally agreed with prior findings, but linear TA:S regressions varied markedly over time and deviated from previously developed models. This variability is likely due to a combination of biological, seasonal, and episodic influences and indicates that substantial errors of ±10–20 μmol kg−1 in TA estimation from S can be expected due to these factors. This finding has likely implications for numerical ecosystem modeling and inorganic carbon system calculations. New results presented in this paper provide refined surface TA:S relationships, present more data in space and time, and improve TA modeling uncertainty.","","article","","232","","","Variability of USA East Coast surface total alkalinity distributions revealed by automated instrument measurements","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420321000451","0304-4203","2021","103960","Marine Chemistry"

A detailed multibeam swath bathymetry study was made of a part of the wide flat shelf off Mumbai encountered at an approximate depth of 50fathom (about 100m) that holds one of the world's richest offshore petroleum resources. The multibeam bathymetry images suggest that the western boundary of the Fifty-Fathom-Flat (FFF) coincides with the shelf break, with a fall much sharper than other places along the west coast. This break also coincides with the western extremity of the carbonate platform.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we define a parameterised family of consistency measures which encompasses three existing definitions of consistency of a belief function. An induced family of conflict measures between belief functions is then derived, and each of these conflict measures is shown to satisfy the previously proposed axiomatization. The family of conflict measures defines several shades of conflict as it encompasses the classical measure of conflict, associated to the weakest definition of consistency, as well as two other conflict measures associated, respectively, to a stronger definition of consistency by Yager and to the strongest definition of consistency by Destercke and Burger. The different measures are illustrated on a toy example of vessel destination estimation. Second, we provide a geometric view on consistency measures as well as on the associated conflict measures. In particular, we show that the consistency of a belief function (whatever the considered definition of consistency) is its distance to the belief function representing the state of total inconsistency. This geometric view is then transposed to conflict measures, shedding some new light on the relation between conflict and distances.","","article","","366","","","Several shades of conflict","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165011419301101","0165-0114","2019","63-84","Fuzzy Sets and Systems"

A laboratory method was devised to electronically observe the splashing event, together with the onset, duration and magnitude of all ensuing coronae. The production of a secondary jet tip and the discovery of a previously unknown corona were originally recorded by Kinsey (1986) and are here described in detail. Emanating from the secondary jet tip, the corona is synonymous with the release and electrification of an airborne water drop and its nC range of charge transfer (being field/momentum dependant) offer low level luminosity to the dark adapted eye (mentioned by ur Rahman and Saunders, 1988). For terminal and near terminal velocity drops, the resulting water jets follow under-damped sinusoidal oscillation and, in fields above a critical value (Ec), their primary tips often support more than one corona, thus yielding charge to the aerosol and space charge below oceanic thunderstorms. Secondary tip, or jet drop, corona data show the phenomenon to occur in fields of 100Vcm−1 and maybe even lower.

In this respect, the calibration of the formula’s parameter vector is conducted based on particle swarm optimization as well as a database of model test results comprising 25 different ships and around 1100 samples. In the first iteration, the minimization of reducible systematic uncertainty is of interest and the effect of four objective functions on prediction accuracy is evaluated. Moreover, two different parameter combinations were obtained for blunt (CB≥0.70) and slender-type ships. Conversely, the irreducible statistical uncertainty, i.e. the inherent noise of the experimental data, is taken into account by a quantile regression procedure. Applying this approach, a 90% prediction interval for the formula’s estimates is implemented using the skewed version of the superior loss function in the previous iteration. The practical relevance of an uncertainty estimate for the prediction of the added resistance is emphasized in the final part, in which the proposed approach is validated in regular waves against model test data and other well-established prediction methods. In general, the validation studies suggest satisfactory performance and reliability of the adapted semi-empirical formulation.","","article","","251","","","Towards the uncertainty quantification of semi-empirical formulas applied to the added resistance of ships in waves of arbitrary heading","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801822004590","0029-8018","2022","111040","Ocean Engineering"

These types include deep convective (DC), cirrostratus, shallow cumulus, stratocumulus and overcast-stratus. A cloud object is a contiguous region of the earth with a single dominant cloud-system type. It is found that the cloud object size distributions of some phases depart greatly from the 8-phase combined distribution at large cloud-object diameters. The large-size group of cloud objects contributes to most of the temporal variations during the MJO evolution. For deep convective and cirrostratus cloud objects, there is a monotonic increase in both the number and footprint of large objects from the depressed to mature phases, which is attributed to the development and maturing of deep convection and anvils. The largest increase in the mean diameter during the mature phases that lasts to the early dissipating phase is related to growth of anvil clouds and is accompanied by moderate decreases in small-size objects. For shallow cumulus, the large objects decrease in number at the mature phases, but increase in number for both sizes before the mature phase. The opposite is true for the large overcast-stratus objects. The temporal evolution of large stratocumulus objects is similar to that of deep convective and cirrostratus object types except for peaking slightly earlier.","","article","","188","","","Cloud object analysis of CERES Aqua observations of tropical and subtropical cloud regimes: Evolution of cloud object size distributions during the Madden–Julian Oscillation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407316300905","0022-4073","2017","148-158","Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer"

The soliton packets were most evident in the images at green wavelengths, which penetrate the deepest into the water column, and only weakly evident at optical wavelengths with shallower penetration. We believe that this is the first observation of internal soliton packets determined from remotely sensed upwelled radiance. We hypothesize that the lineations were produced by changes in the upwelling radiance from the interior of the water column, not by changes in surface reflectance. Using a simulation, it is demonstrated that such lineations can be produced by vertical modulation of the inherent optical properties (IOPs) during the passage of the internal soliton packet.

Therefore, the ability of organizations to react to cyber-attacks and to evolve to a new robustness after successful outbreaks recalls the concept of resilience and brings to the evolution of this concept into that of cyber resilience. In order to offer a deep insight on the management of cyber resilient systems and to propose a Managerial Cyber Resilience Framework, clarifying the role of context in the correct selection and implementation of different tools and practices, we conducted an exploratory multiple case study analysis in six companies operating in three different industries: consultancy, public administration and banking.

The problem of digital twin development is a trade-off between insight into the dynamic process and real-time execution constraint. This paper describes a modelling approach that combines continuous time-domain cycle-mean value engine model with the crank-angle resolved phenomenological combustion model, satisfying the real-time execution constraint. The set of conservation laws, notably energy and mass, supplemented with the phenomenological Wiebe combustion model, is treated in the integral form allowing transformation into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.

We try to add new insight in the long-term, climatic timescale, identification of affected parts of the Mediterranean coastal zone correlated to low atmospheric pressure systems, indicative of the Mediterranean basin during the 21st century. To achieve this goal, an integrated quantitative assessment is proposed by combining projections from available and established, green-house gasses emission/concentration scenarios (based on Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with advanced numerical modelling and statistical post-processing for the definition of cyclonic weather impacts on characteristic coastal zone hotspots. To this end, climate projections and outputs from three Regional Climate Models (RCMs) of the Med-CORDEX initiative at the Mediterranean basin scale are used and extensively evaluated against re-analysis data. These atmospheric datasets feed a robust storm surge model (MeCSS) for the simulation of barotropic hydrodynamics (sea level elevation and currents) thoroughly validated against in situ sea level observations by tide-gauges. Our results corroborate a projected storminess attenuation for the end of the 21st century, yet local differentiations in storm surge maxima around the Mediterranean coastal zone are pinpointed. Moreover, a slight reduction of average storm-induced Mean Sea Level (MSL; component attributed solely to the meteorological residual of sea level elevation) is also apparent towards the end of the 21st century. Extreme storm surge magnitudes range between 0.35 and 0.50 m in the Mediterranean with higher values along parts of its northern coasts (Venice lagoon, Gulf of Lions, northern Adriatic and Aegean Seas, etc.) and the Gulf of Gabes in its southern part. Overall, the spatial distributions of surge maxima are estimated to remain similar to those of the past throughout the entire Mediterranean coastal zone. Differentiations between the two scenarios (RCP4.5-8.5) used are obvious, not so much related to the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge maxima, which shows a very stable pattern, but more in terms of their magnitudes. Indicatively, a decrease of surge maxima from -30% to -2% can be observed towards the end of the 21st century, especially for RCP8.5-driven MeCSS simulations. This is a spatially averaged estimation, yet for some specific coastal sites in Croatia, Spain Italy, and France, such as Rovinj, Bakar, Toulon, Trieste, Ajaccio, Genova, Marseilles, Naples, Venice, Cagliari, Ancona, Ibixa, and Barcelona, the storm surge maxima might increase from 1% to 22% under different RCM/RCP combinations towards the end of the 21st century. Our analysis leads to the quantification of deep depression systems’ effect on the coastal sea level elevation due to storm surges towards 2100. The strongest correlations of deep depression events to high sea levels are observed in several parts along the northern Mediterranean coasts (Gulfs of Valencia and Lions, Ligurian and northern Adriatic Seas). They are followed by mid-latitude areas around Corsica, Sardinia, the mid-zonal Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Sea. The influence of deep depressions on storm surges is lower for Sicily, South Italy, Peloponnese, Crete, the southern Aegean archipelago, and Alboran Sea. The only exceptions in the generally unaffected southern Mediterranean littorals are the Gulfs of Gabes and Alexandretta. These apply to the 20th century; however, they seem to repeat for the 21st century estimations, with even more pronounced differentiations between the southern and the northern parts. A projected northward shift of the main deep depression centres over the Mediterranean towards the end of the 21st century, is likely the reason for the latter. The climate change signal (difference of Future–Reference Period) of the deep cyclones’ effect on the episodic increases of coastal sea level seems to have a very clear pattern of slight attenuation in certain regions, i.e., Sardinia, Corsica, the Ligurian and Adriatic Seas, and the entire Italian peninsula for all RCM-fed implementations towards the end of the 21st century. Conditionally, this is the case for the Gulf of Valencia, the north-western African coasts, the Alboran, Ionian, Aegean, and Libyan Sea coasts, under specific combinations of RCM/RCP forcings. On the other hand, a possible increase of the Mediterranean deep depressions’ influence on the coastal storm surges might be the case for the Gulf of Lions, the Ionian, Aegean and Levantine Sea basins, covering the north-central and north-eastern coasts of Africa. In general, a positive influence of deep depressions to storm surge maxima would probably refer to areas of mid-to-high storm surge maxima (e.g., Aegean, Ionian, Gulf of Lions or Valencia or Gabes, etc.), but not the highest throughout the basin (e.g., Venice lagoon, Ligurian, Adriatic, etc.). In the latter coastal regions, however, intense local wind forcing mechanisms (i.e., Scirocco) are bound to play an essential role in the formation of high storm surges. The produced results can be used in focused studies for integrated hydrologic/hydrodynamic modelling under projected climate change conditions in the 21st century.","","article","","181","","","The impact of climate change on the storm surges of the Mediterranean Sea: Coastal sea level responses to deep depression atmospheric systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500322001639","1463-5003","2023","102149","Ocean Modelling"

Here, we examine the effects of the wind and wave regimes on the vegetation cover and shoreline position of the dune system that makes up the Doniños barrier on the rocky NW Iberian coast since the middle of the 20th century. By studying a series of aerial images, we determined that the vegetated dunes experienced net seaward shoreline advance at an average rate of 1.28 ± 0.01 m/year and an overall dune vegetation coverage expansion of 50.5 %. Available local atmospheric data indicated that wind stilling was the main factor responsible for these trends. However, the shoreline evolution process included annual-to-decadal periods dominated by stalled or reversed advances in energetic winters when waves could reach the foredune, causing erosion and vegetation cover deterioration. Consecutive energetic winters resulted in severe foredune erosion and slow to no recovery of shoreline advance thereafter. This work presents a case study in which a new conceptual model of the opposite and unbalanced effects of wind stilling and storm surges on foredune evolution dynamics is discussed and established under the current climate change scenario.","","article","","423","","","Primary drivers of dune cover and shoreline dynamics: A conceptual model based on the Iberian Atlantic coast","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X22004494","0169-555X","2023","108556","Geomorphology"

Coral δ18O give a record of thermal histories with a precision of ~0.5°C. For this locality, we have determined that the average Δδw effect in the coral skeletons is equivalent to 33% of the skeletal δ18O range. Therefore, if δw effects are not compensated for, the annual skeletal-δ18O range displays a temperature range of 1 °C lower than actual values. The isotopic record of Porites lobata skeletons shows simultaneous depletions in 18O and 13C at skeletal levels corresponding to 1983, coincident with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Therefore, the El Niño event is not only recorded as negative δ18O anomalies in the skeleton, suggesting the warming of ambient waters, but also in the δ13C signal as negative anomalies, indicating coral bleaching. Contrary to the predictions of the “13C-insolation model” that the annual carbon isotope variation should be attenuated with depth in proportion to the decrease in light-intensity variation with depth, we found a clear trend where Δδ13C increases with depth. Coral bioenergetics, which depends on both coral physiology and ecology, may adequately explain the unexpected increase in δ13C range with depth, without contradicting the seasonal character of δ13C variability with the solar irradiance cycle. Although some authors have determined the presence of hiatuses in the skeletal record due to severe stress and growth cessation, in this study it has been found that skeletal growth was not seriously diminished during the El Niño year of 1983. We attribute the good agreement of the δ18O record with the timing and magnitude of the El Niño 1982–1983 warming event to the nature of the warming trend in the area, as well as to some synergistic implications of coral tolerance to thermal stress.","","article","","58","","","Stable isotope geochemistry of corals from Costa Rica as proxy indicator of the EL Niño/southern Oscillation (ENSO)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703794904685","0016-7037","1994","335-351","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

IPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events, and produce reports. Many IPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack’s content. This chapter describes the characteristics of IPS technologies and provides recommendations for designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining them.

The scope of this study is to quantify regionally the skills of CryoSat-2 SAR altimetry for distances to coast smaller than 10 km, during the mission lifetime and at different time scales. The validated geophysical altimeter parameters are the sea surface height above the ellipsoid, the significant sea wave height and wind speed, all computed at 20 Hz. These have been compared to in situ and regional model data along the coasts of German Bight and West Baltic Sea during a time interval of almost six years, from July 2010 to March 2016, to investigate both instantaneous and seasonal behaviour. From CryoSat-2 FBR (Full Bit Rate) data, a Delay-Doppler processing and waveform retracking tailored specifically to the coastal zone has been carried out, by applying a Hamming window and zero-padding, using an extended vertical swath window in order to mitigate tracker errors. Moreover, a dedicated SAMOSA-based coastal retracker (here referred to as SAMOSA+) has also been implemented. Since one of the highest remaining uncertainties in the altimeter parameters estimated in coastal shallow waters arises from residual errors in the applied range and geophysical corrections, innovative and high resolution solutions for ocean tide model, geoid, mean sea surface and wet tropospheric correction have been selected. As CryoSat-2 SAR and LRM (Low Rate Mode) modes are not collocated in time, in order to quantify the improvement in the coastal zone with respect to pulse-limited altimetry, 20 Hz PLRM (pseudo-LRM) data from CryoSat-2 FBR were built and retracked, adopting the ALES adaptive sub-waveform approach, with a numerical Brown-based retracker, here referred to as TALES. The cross-validation proves the good consistency between PLRM and SAR sea level anomaly in the coastal zone. The regional ocean model (BSH) shows the highest agreement with the SAR sea level anomaly, with a standard deviation of the differences (stdd) of 24 cm, whereas the corresponding value with respect to PLRM is 55 cm. Distance to coast plots show that land contamination begins to affect sea level and wave measurements at 2 km from the coast in SAR and at 3.5 km in PLRM TALES. The analysis of monthly mean time-series shows that SAR Altimetry is able to measure the sea level monthly mean in the coastal zone of the region of interest, during the entire mission, more precisely than PLRM. The cross-validation against in situ data also proves the higher accuracy of SAR SAMOSA+ compared to PLRM TALES in the coastal zone, with average SLA stdd of 4.4 cm and 8.4 cm respectively.","","article","","62","","","Coastal SAR and PLRM altimetry in German Bight and West Baltic Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117717308943","0273-1177","2018","1371-1404","Advances in Space Research"

Secondly, a conceptual framework is defined which relates all important components of ICAM/MSP: 1) Ecosystem health and pollution, 2) Natural (coastal) hazards, 3) Marine Space and Use, 4) Coastal land cover and use, 5) population (dynamics), with their respective data collection goals and the most appropriate state-of-the-art sensor technologies to study them, summed up in a comprehensive table. A summary of achievements of remote sensing in each component of ICAM and MSP is given, with a particular interest for developing countries where their implementation is made difficult by several technical and governance issues. Opportunities are also presented to nuance those challenges in the form of programs and initiatives to increase capacity and resources to exploit RS in a MSP/ICAM context, but also to facilitate RS data accessibility and usability. Finally, future satellite missions of particular interest for ICAM and MSP are introduced. Overall, the word “Integrated” in ICAM suggests that a multidisciplinary approach is needed to understand the dynamics of marine and coastal environments, and remote sensing is identified as a piece of the puzzle which coastal and ocean managers should not hesitate to integrate in their practices.

The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br−) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD ~1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun–climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.","","article","","580","","","Bromine soil/sediment enrichment in tidal salt marshes as a potential indicator of climate changes driven by solar activity: New insights from W coast Portuguese estuaries","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716325840","0048-9697","2017","324-338","Science of The Total Environment"

This review study indicates: (i) geohazards of different phases and geohazard chain are generally triggered by both early-phase tectonics-dominated and later-phase sedimentation-dominated processes; (ii) the fault geometric and stress segmentation may have played an important role in controlling on the uneven and asymmetric distribution of earthquakes and submarine canyons of the northern SCS, Especially, the ENE-striking preexisting Littoral Fault Zone is the major seismogenic structure along the Southchina coastline; (iii) the tectono-sedimentary coupling induced landslide and slope failure that has help to shape the modern coastal and slope geomorphology.","","article","","220","","","A review of geohazards on the northern continental margin of the South China Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221002348","0012-8252","2021","103733","Earth-Science Reviews"

There have been instances, however, particularly in the aviation field, where the designated methods of inspection were not able to detect cracks, and as a result catastrophic failures occurred. In the aviation field, when major-accidents occur there is usually a thorough investigation to determine the cause. We are fortunate the accident reports concerning such events are made public, so that engineers can learn from the mistakes which led to an accident and take corrective action to prevent a recurrence of such accidents. The present paper discusses a number of cases wherein faulty inspection procedures resulted in accidents. These cases are based upon published reports as well as personal experiences, and will deal with the crashes which involved: a 707 freighter (visual examination), a DC-10 (dye penetrant), a small passenger plane (magnetic particle), a 737 (eddy currents), and a 747 freighter (ultrasonics).","","article","","11","","","Failures in inspection procedures: case studies","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350630703000815","1350-6307","2004","167-176","Engineering Failure Analysis"

At the Virolahti background station, closest to the eastern fire areas, the episodes lasted altogether several weeks. The high point in spring was 25 April and in summer 13 August. In spring the aerosol detected at Virolahti originated at distances of even hundreds of kilometres to the south and south-east, and consequently was a mixture of material from biomass burning and from other sources (both LRT and local), all of which contributed to the detected elevation of PM10 concentrations. The elevated concentrations of trace elements (Cd, Pb, Zn) during the most intense biomass fire episode were associated with other anthropogenic emissions. In contrast, during August 2006, the PM10 at Virolahti was quite exclusively impacted by close (ca. 50–100km) biomass fire sources. The presumably organic component comprised, at its highest, as much as 90% of the total PM10. In addition to record high PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were considerably elevated, even reaching values more typical of wintertime urban environments. During the peaks of the episodes in August, the total gaseous mercury concentration in the air was more than double its background value. In general, the trace elements did not exceed their background values.","","article","","42","","","Impact of the open biomass fires in spring and summer of 2006 on the chemical composition of background air in south-eastern Finland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231008004615","1352-2310","2008","6472-6486","Atmospheric Environment"

Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) focus primarily on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators. In addition, organizations use IPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events, and produce reports. Many IPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack’s content. This chapter describes the characteristics of IPS technologies and provides recommendations for designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining them. The types of IPS technologies are differentiated primarily by the types of events that they monitor and the ways in which they are deployed.","Boston","incollection","Morgan Kaufmann","","Computer and Information Security Handbook (Second Edition)","978-0-12-394397-2","Chapter 4 - Preventing System Intrusions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123943972000040","","2013","63-79",""

The snorkel survey method, described here, also called ‘Geoswim’, allows rough-and-ready surveys of long sectors of rocky coasts. In particular, it is able to collect time-lapse images perpendicularly to the coastline and observe long sectors of rocky coastline, with particular reference to the tidal zone. In addition to the photographic survey along the coast, rough measures, lateral variations in geomorphological, geological, biological, and ecological parameters and the collection of hydrological data are usually performed during the work. The expeditions also provide the opportunity to produce large databases of coastal landforms such as coastal sea caves and tidal notches. The data collected can be improved by additional on-the-spot observations. The evaluation of the methodology here proposed was based on the results of SWOT analysis starting from the results and the experience of previous expeditions. Geoswim is the first snorkel approach that allows the collection of large amount of multidisciplinary data along wide sectors of rocky coastline. At the moment, this approach is the best and probably the only technique for characterizing the tidal and nearshore zone, but also to collect observational data of prominent objects along rocky coasts. However, snorkel observations are affected by limitations similar to those of terrestrial field surveys. The ability to observe specific forms or phenomena increases through the practice of field observation and are strongly observer-influenced. Sheltered sea basins are better suited than ocean basins, where tides and wave energy are generally higher. Data collection is also affected by weather and sea conditions. The quality of time-lapse images and videos may be reduced as a result of breakers at the cliffs, producing images that cannot be used for subsequent analysis. As for external factors, some sectors of the coast may be closed due to local restrictions on field activities.","","article","","425","","","Integrating observational targets and instrumental data on rock coasts through snorkel surveys: A methodological approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322720300797","0025-3227","2020","106191","Marine Geology"

By analysing tree-ring patterns of 91 trees, four extreme snow-avalanche events, extending over the entire valley floor and up to a distance of 800m from the foot of the slope, are clearly highlighted during the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century. Return periods of 15 to 20years for the most extreme events are extracted from the analyses, and recurrence intervals of 10 to 15years for avalanches presenting distinct deposition lobes uphill of the distal torrent. Results obtained by tree-ring analyses are successfully compared with available documents at different spatial and temporal scales. Rock-face snow-avalanche occurrences in the area, of small to medium size, are associated with heavy wintry precipitation combined with strong winds. However this normal situation is not valid for extreme snow avalanches crossing the path investigated in the paper, which result from the outlet glacier located in the starting zone; this glacier commands spatial and inter-annual variations of snow accumulation in the departure zone.","","article","","218","","","A 100-year extreme snow-avalanche record based on tree-ring research in upper Bødalen, inner Nordfjord, western Norway","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X14000051","0169-555X","2014","3-15","Geomorphology"

This paper presents the first oxygen isotope data of fossil diatoms from Kamchatka, Russia, derived from sediment cores from Two-Yurts Lake (TYL). For reconstructing Late Holocene climate change, palaeolimnological investigations also included diatom, pollen and chironomid analysis. The most recent diatom sample (δ18Odiatom=+23.3‰) corresponds well with the present day isotopic composition of the TYL water (mean δ18O=−14.8‰) displaying a reasonable isotope fractionation in the system silica-water. Nonetheless, the TYL δ18Odiatom record is mainly controlled by changes in the isotopic composition of the lake water. TYL is considered as a dynamic system triggered by differential environmental changes closely linked with lake-internal hydrological factors. The diatom silica isotope record displays large variations in δ18Odiatom from +27.3‰ to +23.3‰ from about ~4.5kyr BP until today. A continuous depletion in δ18Odiatom of 4.0‰ is observed in the past 4.5kyr, which is in good accordance with other hemispheric environmental changes (i.e. a summer insolation-driven Mid- to Late Holocene cooling). The overall cooling trend is superimposed by regional hydrological and atmospheric–oceanic changes. These are related to the interplay between Siberian High and Aleutian Low as well as to the ice dynamics in the Sea of Okhotsk. Additionally, combined δ18Odiatom and chironomid interpretations provide new information on changes related to meltwater input to lakes. Hence, this diatom isotope study provides further insight into hydrology and climate dynamics of this remote, rarely investigated area.","","article","","134","","","Oxygen isotope composition of diatoms as Late Holocene climate proxy at Two-Yurts Lake, Central Kamchatka, Russia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818114001696","0921-8181","2015","118-128","Global and Planetary Change"

Specifically, the study addresses itself to the detection of anomalous soils in the vicinity of a mineralized zone. A kinetic study of selectivity of partial chemical extractions-applied to minerals of Pb and Zn was undertaken in order to establish a systematic procedure (reagents, time of extraction, etc.) which could be recommended for the soils of the study area in Portugal. It is shown that: (1) NH4 acetate dissolves smithsonite, willemite, cerussite, anglesite, pyromorphite completely and coronadite, galena, sphalerite only partially; (2) hydroxylamine hydrochloride dissolves coronadite only partially; (3) H2O2 dissolves sphalerite and galena only partially; (4) hot mixed acids dissolve residual galena, sphalerite and coronadite. About 850 soil and gossan samples were collected from two mineralized districts in Portugal, one in a carbonate environment (Portel) and the other in an aluminosilicate zone (Sanguinheiro). For the kinetic study in soil samples from Portel and Sanguinheiro zones, the minus 80 mesh fraction (−180 μm) was submitted to an extraction procedure using the following reagents, in sequence: NH4 acetate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, NH4 oxalate in darkness, NH4 oxalate under U.V. irradiation and finally strong acids. The mineralogy of the soils from the two areas is different. In the aluminosilicate zone, the products of weathering of sulphide mineralization are mainly anglesite, plumbogummite, amorphous iron oxides, goethite and hematite rich in Pb and Zn. In the carbonate area, the Pb- and Zn-bearing phases generally found in the soil and gossan are Mn oxides, lepidocrocite and hematite. The gossan, in this case, also contains smithsonite and cerussite. In soils from the aluminosilicate zone the use of NH4 oxalate (dark) given a better geochemical response for Pb than NH4 acetate, NH4 oxalate (U.V.) and conventional acid digestion. On the other hand, NH4 oxalate (U.V.) gives better results for Pb and Zn than conventional acid digestion in samples from carbonate area. The analysis of NH4 oxalate (U.V.) extractions, instead of conventional acid digestion, can nevertheless be recommended for both environments.","","article","","26","","","The selective extraction of Pb and Zn in selected mineral and soil samples, application in geochemical exploration (Portugal)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375674286900749","0375-6742","1986","231-248","Journal of Geochemical Exploration"

A retrospective marine epidemiological approach was developed to demonstrate that marine morbidity, mortality, and disease information is recoverable by keyword searching of academic journals and through the retrieval of publicly available digital and print-media information. Observational records compiled from disturbances occurring within the Northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea confirm that anomalous marine morbidity and mortality events have increased in number and frequency during the last 30 years.

Variations of seven air pollutants (O3, CO, NO, NO2, NOx, SO2 and PM10) and three meteorological factors (temperature, humidity and wind speed) were analysed. Statistical methods used to analyse the data included principal component regression (PCR) and sensitivity analysis. The results showed PM10 was the dominant air pollutant in Langkawi and values ranged between 5.0 μg m−3 and 183.2 μg m−3. The patterns of monthly values showed that the concentrations of measured air pollutants on Langkawi were higher during the south-west monsoon (June–September) due to seasonal biomass burning activities. High CO/NOx ratio values (between 28.3 and 43.6), low SO2/NOx ratio values (between 0.04 and 0.12) and NO/NO2 ratio values exceeding 2.2 indicate the source of air pollutants in this area was motor vehicles. PCR analysis grouped the seven variables into two factor components: the F1 component consisted of SO2, NO and NOx and the F2 component consisted of PM10. The F1 component (R2 = 0.931) indicated a stronger standardized coefficient value for meteorological variables compared to the F2 component (R2 = 0.059). The meteorological variables were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in influencing the distribution of the air pollutants. The status of air quality on the island could be improved through control on motor vehicle emissions as well as collaborative efforts to reduce regional air pollution, especially from biomass burning.","","article","","4","","","The long-term assessment of air quality on an island in Malaysia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018315408","2405-8440","2018","e01054","Heliyon"

Flood estimation and management may benefit from understanding how the different flood characteristics relate to the hydrological catchment conditions preceding the event and to the meteorological conditions throughout the event. In this study, we therefore propose a methodology to investigate the hydro-meteorological controls on different flood characteristics, based on the simulation of the complete flood risk chain from the flood triggering precipitation event, through runoff generation in the catchment, flood routing and possible inundation in the river system and floodplains to flood loss. Conditional cumulative distribution functions and regression tree analysis delineate the seasonal varying flood processes and indicate that the effect of the hydrological pre-conditions, i.e. soil moisture patterns, and of the meteorological conditions, i.e. weather patterns, depends on the considered flood characteristic. The methodology is exemplified for the Elbe catchment. In this catchment, the length of the build-up period, the event duration and the number of gauges undergoing at least a 10-year flood are governed by weather patterns. The affected length and the number of gauges undergoing at least a 2-year flood are however governed by soil moisture patterns. In case of flood severity and loss, the controlling factor is less pronounced. Severity is slightly governed by soil moisture patterns whereas loss is slightly governed by weather patterns. The study highlights that flood magnitude and extent arise from different flood generation processes and concludes that soil moisture patterns as well as weather patterns are not only beneficial to inform on possible flood occurrence but also on the involved flood processes and resulting flood characteristics.","","article","","545","","","What are the hydro-meteorological controls on flood characteristics?","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169416307922","0022-1694","2017","310-326","Journal of Hydrology"

This model integrates almost all representative components of the cave ecosystem and gives an idea of their faunal compositions, characteristics and related interactions. This model constitutes the basis of the Ecosystem-Based Quality Index (EBQI) of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which aims at evaluating the ecological quality of an ecosystem. It is based on four crucial complementary elements: (i) each component was weighted in accordance with its importance in determining the structure and functioning of the cave ecosystem; (ii) a suite of relevant parameters were defined to assess the ecological state of each component of the cave ecosystem; (iii) these parameters were aggregated into one relevant index, the Cave EBQI (CavEBQI), to summarize the quality evaluation for each cave site; (iv) each value of ecological state is accompanied by a Confidence Index as a measure of its reliability. The CavEBQI was used on 22 Mediterranean undersea caves of France and Italy. Disparities of ecological quality were found among caves but most of them ranged from moderate to high ecological quality. For some caves, no conclusion can be drawn when our method predicts a poor reliability of the evaluation of their ecological quality. This ecosystem-based evaluation of the quality of undersea caves seems to be a powerful tool, with the advantage of being based on almost all its components, rather than just on a few species. It is accompanied by a measure of its reliability, hence it provides a reliable idea of the ecological state of the entire ecosystem at each cave site. Monitoring the ecological state of caves and the effects of disturbances over large geographic and temporal scales is made possible with CavEBQI. Applying the same method to other ecosystems, can provide an integrated view of a marine region, which is essential when addressing questions about protection, conservation and restoration.","","article","","54","","","An ecosystem-based approach to evaluate the ecological quality of Mediterranean undersea caves","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X15000916","1470-160X","2015","137-152","Ecological Indicators"

Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) which is the most widely used in literature is one of these models. HFACS is based on Reason's Swiss Cheese Model. The biggest disadvantage of the Reason's model is its post-accident applicability. Mostly HFACS aviation applications are usually based on accident data. This is a reagent (result-focused) approach. In this study, however, HFACS which is an improved version of Reason's model, was applied to aircraft incidents that did not result in an accident. This is a proactive approach. Thus, with this approach, the biggest disadvantage of Reason's model is turned into an advantage. In addition, a realistic application of this approach has been demonstrated in this study, focusing on aircraft incidents that took place between 2000 and 2018. The year 2000 forms a milestone in the manufacture of more technically advanced aircraft models which significantly reduced occurrence of technical errors in aircrafts, hence the choice of 2000 as base year. A total of 328 aircraft incident reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database were studied and among these reports cockpit crew related incidents were analyzed using HFACS. As a result of the analyzes, the root causes of incidents have been identified. In addition, unlike traditional HFACS analysis, the relationship between errors occurred at management levels of HFACS and the unsafe acts of the cockpit crew in aircraft incidents was statistically revealed.","","article","","84","","","The effect of management practices on aircraft incidents","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699718304460","0969-6997","2020","101784","Journal of Air Transport Management"

The successful forestation programs implemented in China-which have improved the ecological environmental conditions-have gained the attention of many researchers and highlighted the relationship between forestation and water yields. The arid and semi-arid Loess Plateau has received attention from water engineers and eco-hydrological researchers in China because of a shortage in water resources. We selected one of the oldest stations conducting soil and water conservation experiments, the Xifeng soil and water conservation station, and chose the Nanxiaohe catchment and its paired catchments (Yangjiagou catchment and Dongzhuanggou catchment) as our research areas. Trends in precipitation, air temperature, streamflow over the past 50 years, and the effect of changing land use on streamflow were analyzed. The Mann-Kendall test showed that precipitation had a negative trend (downward trend), whereas air temperature showed a positive trend (upward trend) from the past to present in the Nanxiaohe catchment. However, the trends seen in precipitation, air temperature did not contain any “jumping points.” The paired catchment approach is used to detect the effects of land cover change on hydrology in the Yangjiagou and the contrast catchment, i.e., Dongzhuanggou catchment in our study. The results showed a large change in land use in the Yangjiagou catchment from 1954 to 2008. An increase in forested land (from 0% to 40.08% from 1954 to 2008) and a reduction of bare land (from 51.26% to 5.50% from 1954 to 2008) accounted for a large part of the change in land use.

Here we present the first assessment of the NGH stability zone (GHSZ) in central Spitsbergen, a climate-sensitive part of Svalbard where thermobaric conditions appear favourable for onshore NGH formation. We developed an approach incorporating regionally constrained 3-dimensional parameterisation of temperature, pressure and phase boundary (93% methane, 7% ethane, 35 ppt salinity) to define the GHSZ. This resulted in an up to 650 m thick (mean: 308 m) GHSZ covering 74.8% of the study area, thickening significantly in the east where the climate is colder. Perturbation of the base case parameters was undertaken to quantify the sensitivity of the GHSZ to the variation in environmental conditions across the study area. We present 26 examples of these deterministic scenarios and show that the largest changes in the GHSZ were observed when either the ethane content (to 20%) or the regional pore water pressure (to 125% hydrostatic) were increased. The GHSZ also increased markedly when the geothermal gradient was reduced from 33 to 26 °C km−1, but was almost completely inhibited by a dry gas (100% methane), greater salinity (50 ppt), or exposure to an increase in surface temperatures relative to the mean annual air temperature (e.g., by 2 °C). Most parameters affected both the upper and the lower stability boundary of the GHSZ, with the exception of the geothermal gradient, which impacted primarily upon the latter. Given that Svalbard is host to a proven petroleum system, we conclude that NGHs almost certainly exist onshore Svalbard.","","article","","100","","","3D thermobaric modelling of the gas hydrate stability zone onshore central Spitsbergen, Arctic Norway","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817218304653","0264-8172","2019","246-262","Marine and Petroleum Geology"

These time series were analyzed using Fourier transformation methods. Spyglass Transform software allowed the resulting power spectra to be stacked and compared, based on characteristics such as topography and continentality, latitude and species ecological niche. Results suggested that several regular or quasi-regular cycles are occurring over various time periods. There are some similarities, though not an exact match, with El Niño periodicities noted by earlier authors. These patterns appear to be widespread, affecting trees at various elevations and distances from the coast, and from different species. A separate analysis of the oldest trees revealed sub-century cycles. In particular, the longer fluctuations at 50–65 years are consistent with recent findings on north Pacific climate by other authors. A Euclidean cluster analysis of individual years identified unusual year groupings between 1924–1946, a period associated with positive temperature anomalies and generally higher precipitation.

The tropical climate processes, via various feedback mechanisms, control the surface ocean climate in the Indian Ocean and its surrounding continents on annual to inter-annual timescales. However, little has been known about how the tropical processes are effective forcing climate mechanism over longer timescales. Here we presented a reconstruction of the spatiotemporal pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) with inferred hydroclimate changes since the early Holocene (∼11ka), using proxies of planktonic foraminifer shell Mg/Ca, organic biomarker (TEX86), foraminifer oxygen isotopes, and a terrigenous BIT index measured from a 220 cm long Core BS24 (2.724041°N, 97.010943°E, 1015 m water depth) which was taken offshore of northwest Sumatra in the eastern Indian Ocean. With an age model of 13 AMS 14C dating by the uses of planktonic foraminiferal shells from the core, the TEX86H temperatures of BS24 show as summer-weighted, and reflect integrated thermal effects from the surface to thermocline water, while the Mg/Ca temperature of BS24 better reflects mean annual SST. Our results, along with a regional synthesis of published SST records from the IPWP, suggest that the IPWP has migrated eastwardly since the mid-Holocene (∼5ka). In phase with this eastward migration, the IPWP SSTs have decreased, but the upwelling in the eastern Indian Ocean appears to have been a persistent feature since the mid-Holocene. Our Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the compiled IPWP SST records indicates two dominant modes of spatio-temporal variability of surface hydrographes in the IPWP that are attributed to a combined effect of orbital and solar forcing, with expressions analogous to the Indian ocean basin-wide mode (IOBM) and the Indian Ocean dipole model (IOD).","","article","","482","","","Holocene surface hydroclimate changes in the Indo-Pacific warm pool","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618218302799","1040-6182","2018","1-12","Quaternary International"

The mineralogy of the sediments is consistent with an origin from the release of mine waste from tin streaming and smelt products into the estuary. Further to the south, the down-core geochemistry of the estuary sediments is uniform with values of typically 400 ppm.

It included the delivery of ten thematic reports (TR), a Causal Chain Analysis (CCA), Ecosystem Diagnostic Analyses (EDA)(one each for Chile and Peru), a Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) and a Strategic Action Program (SAP). The transboundary problems affecting the state of goods and services provided by the Humboldt Current Large Marine Ecosystem (HCLME) are: (1) non optimal use of fishing resources with socio-economic consequences; (2) anthropogenic disturbance of marine habitats after an increase in pollution levels within the HCLME; and (3) high incidental by-catch and associated fauna destruction and discards as a common problem for the two countries. Governance aspects developed during the past five years (2011-16) included, a “bottom-up” process in Peru and Chile linked to the establishment of new fishing and aquaculture acts, Marine Protected Areas and territorial use rights for artisanal fisheries, new methods for fish stock assessment, and ecolabelling of fisheries, among others. Management plans have been designed for pilot sites: the Juan Fernandez Archipelago in Chile; and Lobos de Tierra Island, Ballestas Islands and San Juan cape in Peru. A first Total Economic Value calculation of the goods and services provided by the HCLME in 2015 indicates a delivery of US$19.45 billion per annum. This value comprises 58% from Chile (US$ 11.28 billion) and 42% from Peru (US$ 8.17 billion). Additionally, the area of direct influence of the Humboldt Current System generates 77% (US$ 14.97 billion) of the value produced by the HCLME, where the tropical area of Peru and the southern area of Chile added 2% (US$ 0.45 billion) and 21% (US$ 4.03 billion), respectively. Possible scenarios of climate change in the HCLME were focused on the changes of biogeochemical alterations and forcing on the productivity and abundance-distribution of key species. Currently, high ocean productivity is an expression of the relatively high biomass of pelagic fish like anchovy, pacific jack mackerel and sardine, also other fishing resources like demersal fish (hake), cephalopod molluscs (squid), crustaceans (shrimp) have important contributions.

The focus was on the warm part of the year (April to October) during the period 2006–2009 over six sub-regions in Croatia. A convectively active day is defined as a day with at least ten lightning strikes over the target sub-region. The obtained dataset is used to determine the climatology of the frequency and regional distribution of convective days and their inter-month variability. The analysis shows that 56% of all examined days, i.e., every second day during the warm part of the year, are days with convective activity. The most convectively active sub-region is the North Adriatic, with 62.4% of all days in the analyzed sample. The areas eastward of 16°E exhibit a peak in convective activity in June, contrary to the more western sub-regions, which show a maximum later in the summer, from July to August. The average temporal characteristics, such as typical duration, onset and cessation of convection, are also estimated. In all sub-regions, the convective activity begins in the early afternoon and ends mostly in the evening. Nocturnal convection occurs more frequently along the Adriatic coast. In the second part of this study, the dominant large-scale weather types and upper-level flow regimes, corresponding to the convectively active days, were determined using surface and upper-levels pressure fields. The lightning flashes are frequently detected in the non-gradient pressure field (23%); in the center (18%), in the leading (15%) and in the rear (12%) parts of the cyclone; and in the front part of a trough (11%). The southwesterly upper-level flow represents the most common flow regime (38%) in the days with convective activity. Slightly less is the northeasterly flow, which occurs with a frequency of approximately 23%, and the northwesterly flow, with a frequency of 18% of all selected days.","","article","","104-105","","","Analysis of the convective activity and its synoptic background over Croatia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809511003012","0169-8095","2012","139-153","Atmospheric Research"

The chronologies of the ARC-4 and ARC-5 cores were determined using a combination of 14C AMS dates obtained from macrobenthic fossils and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The ages of the tops of the piston cores were estimated by matching chemical and physical parameters with those obtained from corresponding box cores. These analyses revealed that, while the top of the ARC-4 piston core was estimated to be essentially modern (ca. 60 cal yr BP), a few hundred years of sediment appeared to be absent from the ARC-5 piston core. Downcore changes to IP25 fluxes for both cores were interpreted in terms of variations in spring sea ice occurrence, and correlations between the individual IP25 flux profiles for Victoria Strait, Dease Strait and Barrow Strait (reported previously) were shown to be statistically significant at both 50 and 100-year resolutions. The IP25 data indicate lower spring sea ice occurrences during the early part of the record (ca. 7.0–3.0 cal kyr BP) and for parts of the late Holocene (ca. 1.5–0.8 cal kyr BP), especially for the two lower latitude study locations. In contrast, higher spring sea ice occurrences existed during ca. 3.0–1.5 cal kyr BP and after ca. 800 cal yr BP. The observation of, consecutively, lower and higher spring sea ice occurrence during two periods of the late Holocene, coincides broadly with the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age epochs, respectively. The IP25 data are complemented by particle size and mineralogical data, although these may alternatively reflect changes in sea level at the study sites. The IP25 data are also compared to previous proxy-based determinations of palaeo sea ice and palaeoclimate for the CAA, including those based on bowhead whale remains and dinocyst assemblages. The spatial consistency in the proxy data which, most notably, indicates an increase in spring sea ice occurrence around 3 cal kyr BP, provides a potentially useful benchmark for the termination of the Holocene Thermal Maximum for the central CAA.","","article","","29","","","Striking similarities in temporal changes to spring sea ice occurrence across the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago over the last 7000 years","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379110002362","0277-3791","2010","3489-3504","Quaternary Science Reviews"

While Ad-hoc and precession spread constellations have been quantitatively evaluated, Walker constellations show the best performance in simulation. Sixteen satellites in two perpendicular orbital planes are shown to provide more than 99% coverage over representative Alaskan airspace and the maximum time gap where any airplane in Alaska is not covered is six minutes, therefore meeting the standard set by the International Civil Aviation Organization to monitor every airplane at least once every fifteen minutes. In spite of the risk of signal collision when multiple packets arrive at the satellite receiver, the proposed constellation shows 99% cumulative probability of reception within four minutes when the airplanes are transmitting every minute, and at ~100% reception probability if transmitting every second.

The chapter begins with a brief general introduction, touching on both these diverse aspects. To meaningfully introduce the topic of the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio, some related aspects, such as the historical episode of fire breakout in the Japan Sea, and the trawler wreck in Witch’s Hole pockmark have been described. Subsequent discussion focus on other related aspects, including methane hydrate deposits in the seafloor sediment layer and their role in the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio, as well as the possible influence of the warm Gulf Stream in triggering methane gas emission, which, based on scientific evidence, is suspected to be the culprit in the sudden disappearances of ships and low-flying aircraft in the Bermuda Triangle region. The discussion is strengthened by invoking various scientific studies carried out to unlock the secret behind this dreaded story. The second part of this chapter addresses another interesting aspect of the ocean floor, namely, the carpet of “dark gold” (PMN) having been paved over by nature over a period of billions of years’ utterly slow growth (at the rate of 1–3mm/million years). The chapter attaches due importance to the devices used for collection of the dark gold from the abyssal ocean depths (paved on the ocean floor, as well as buried in thick sediments lying below the ocean floor’s water-sediment interface). Subsequent discussion on the dark nodules revolves around important aspects, such as their specialty and structure, factors influencing their formation, the role of nucleating materials, their shape and surface texture, internal features (thickness of oxide layer, internal microstructure), chemical composition, role of micro-organisms in their formation, and presence of rare earth elements.

The results, obtained from lithological, geomagnetic, geochemical and diatom analyses, and the frequency of Branchinecta eggs, were evaluated with multivariate statistics and provide a fairly detailed picture of climate change during the last 5000 years. New radiocarbon dates are combined with previously published 14C dates, so as to date the palaeoenvironmental and palaeohydrological changes identified by the stratigraphic studies. In combination with the findings of glacial geological studies our data suggest that the Brandy Bay glacier began to recede rapidly just before 5000 yr B.P., due to calving and moisture starvation caused by cold and arid conditions. In one of the ponds studied gypsum began to precipitate as a consequence of these conditions when the influence of glacial meltwater ceased. This hypothesis was tested by hydrochemical modeling. At approximately 4200 yr B.P. the climate became more humid (and warmer) and the pond supported a fairly diverse biota, which included a variety of diatom species and, for example, Branchinecta gaini, a crustacean that feeds on benthic cyanobacterial mats. The Brandy Bay glacier probably advanced during this humid period, but the advance was interrupted by subsequent arid conditions which started at 3000 yr B.P. During this arid phase, glaciers became completely absent from the study area. As a result formerly large lakes, fed by glacial meltwater, transformed into small, enclosed, brackish water bodies that contained B. gaini. The arid and fairly cold conditions lasted for 1500–2000 years, until approximately 1200 yr B.P. when the aquatic systems expanded and their salinity was lowered as a result of increased snow accumulation and glacial expansion. The increased deposition of minerogenic matter caused by glacial erosion and meltwater inflow probably caused the disappearance of Branchinecta on James Ross Island. We regard this most recent phase as a period of increased humidity and warmth compared to the previous period, although the conditions appear to be less warm and humid than those which prevailed during the climatic optimum between 4200 and 3000 yr B.P. In spite of certain correlation problems we tentatively correlate our results to other studies of Holocene environments in Antarctica, and from that it can be suggested that the climatic optimum was of circumpolar significance. Therefore the climatic oscillations recorded in sediments on James Ross Island may reflect oscillations in the anticyclonic stormtracks and the strength of the high pressure cell over the inland ice sheet.","","article","","121","","","Late Holocene palaeoclimatic records from lake sediments on James Ross Island, Antarctica","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031018295000860","0031-0182","1996","195-220","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

This study inculcates demand and supply-side determinants to investigate the long- and short-run causal relationships between the electric power system, macroeconomic performance, demography, environmental quality, and capital formation, for Sweden. We also propose and implement econometric and two-stage attention-based machine learning models for volatility-consistent electric power forecasting. Using annual data spanning 1990–2018, the results suggest a long-run relationship exists between electricity generation and the independent variables. Empirical results for the volatility-consistent attention-based machine learning model predict that Sweden’s electric power demand in 2050 could reach ∼112 TWh if conservation practices are implemented, and ∼146 TWh if otherwise. If conservation practices are implemented, evidence from selected volatility-consistent simulations show that Sweden can provide 100% of all her electricity demand from cleaner sources by 2030. The findings depict that Sweden must implement stringent and radical policies to achieve its mid-century green electricity targets.","","article","","299","","","Demand and supply-side determinants of electric power consumption and representative roadmaps to 100% renewable systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621010519","0959-6526","2021","126832","Journal of Cleaner Production"

The composition of SGD is influenced by biogeochemical reactions that take place within the subterranean estuary (STE), the subsurface mixing zone of fresh and saline groundwaters. The STE is characterized by redox gradients that affect the speciation and mobility of redox-sensitive elements (RSEs). We examined the distributions and behavior of the RSEs Mo, U, V, and Cr within the larger redox framework of a shallow STE and evaluated the source-sink function of the STE for these elements. We found that the advection of water through the STE and the apparent respiration of organic matter drives the formation of a “classic” redox sequence typically observed in diffusion-dominated fine-grained sediments. High concentrations of dissolved organic matter (up to 2.9mM) lead to extensive sulfide production (up to 1.8mM) within 3m of the surface. Both Mo and U are quantitatively removed as oxic surface waters mix into ferruginous and sulfidic zones. Molybdenum removal appears to occur where sulfide concentrations exceed ~11μM, a previously reported threshold for quantitative formation of highly particle-reactive thiomolybdate species. Uranium removal apparently occurs via reduction and formation of insoluble phases or sorption to sediments. It is not clear how readily sequestered metals may be returned to solution, but SGD may be an important sink in the marine budget for both Mo and U. In contrast, both V and Cr show non-conservative addition across the salinity mixing gradient. Increases in pH appear to promote dissolution of V from minerals within the shallow aquifer, and mobilization may also be associated with dissolved organic matter. Chromium enrichment is associated with higher dissolved organic matter and is likely due to the formation of soluble Cr-organic complexes. Fluxes of these elements were constrained using SGD volume fluxes, determined using radium isotopes as well as direct discharge measurements by Lee-type seepage meters, and concentrations in directly-sampled seepage (Mo: −0.21 to −7.7μmolm−2day−1; U: −0.02 to −0.6μmolm−2day−1; V: 0.05 to 2.0μmolm−2day−1; Cr: 0.12 to 4.4μmolm−2day−1).","","article","","172","","","Geochemistry of redox-sensitive trace elements in a shallow subterranean estuary","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420315000432","0304-4203","2015","70-81","Marine Chemistry"

We used published results for 7Be but performed full simulations of the 22Na production in atmosphere. For the first time, lookup tables of 22Na production by cosmic rays in the atmosphere are presented. In conjunction with calculations using the new model of 22Na production, the 7Be/22Na ratios in the atmosphere were also calculated. The wavelet transform of the 7Be and 22Na time series revealed sets of periodicities in the 2.5–8 year range. The wavelet coherence method was used to study coherences between 7Be and 22Na and 7Be/22Na data and AO, NAO, AMO, QBO and SO teleconnection indices representing different climatic variations in Northern Europe. In the wavelet coherence analyses, the 7Be activities were found to be mainly modulated by NAO and AMO at an interannual scale, while 22Na activity was found to be less effected by climatic phenomena. The 7Be coherence with other indices was intermittent where the coherence with SO was limited to Ivalo data and in the case of QBO, to Kotka data. The 22Na data was not found to be in coherence with any of the studied indices. In the 7Be/22Na ratio a clear seasonal pattern was observed where low 7Be/22Na ratios were observed during summer and high ratios during winter. This was speculated to be caused by the height of atmospheric vertical mixing. During 2006–2011, the 7Be/22Na ratios from Kotka, Kajaani and Rovaniemi showed variance at synoptic time scales but were nearly identical at the seasonal scale. The 7Be/22Na ratio was proposed to be a radiochronometer to estimate residence times of aerosols carrying 7Be and 22Na.","","article","","74","","","Cosmogenic 7Be and 22Na in Finland: Production, observed periodicities and the connection to climatic phenomena","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682611003002","1364-6826","2012","164-180","Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics"

An earlier petrographic study of rock and mineral clasts from Dwyka Group diamictites revealed no evidence for shock metamorphism, such as planar deformation features. Detailed geochemical studies of diamictite samples from the Archean Witwatersrand Supergroup and the Dwyka Group of the Mesozoic Karoo Supergroup from South Africa are reported. We studied the contents of the siderophile elements in these breccias, as elevated abundances of such elements, especially iridium, could be indicative for an impact origin. By use of γ-γ coincidence spectrometry and other trace element analysis, geochemical tracers of extraterrestrial components were sought. However, no enrichments of indicator elements for extraterrestrial components, compared with ordinary continental crust, were found. Thus, neither geochemical nor petrographic evidence supports an impact origin of the diamictites from the Dwyka Group and the Witwatersrand Supergroup in South Africa.","","article","","65","","","Geochemistry and petrology of Witwatersrand and Dwyka diamictites from South Africa: search for an extraterrestrial component","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703701005695","0016-7037","2001","2007-2016","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

Resilience and vulnerability are representative indicators in the performance analysis of transportation systems. A large number of related studies have emerged in recent years. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress in the study of vulnerability and resilience. Specific definitions of resilience and vulnerability are first given from the perspective of transportation system’s supply and demand. Other related concepts of transportation system performance (TSP) are also discussed including reliability, robustness, survivability and risk. The existing studies can be divided into two aspects, i.e., the traditional topological structure and system structure analysis. The study of topology structure mainly revolves around graph theory, which is also the cornerstone of TSP research. In recent years, advances in data analysis and model simulation technology have led to an increasing number of studies considering the overall transportation system structure. The related metrics and research methods are carefully analyzed and summarized from qualitative and quantitative perspectives.

Mean natural remanent magnetisation (NRM) intensity values for individual sample sites range from 0.0013 to 1.6008 mA/m, with an overall mean of 0.0165 mA/m. Reliable determination of the remanence of the very weakly magnetic units was achieved by carrying out replicate palaeomagnetic measurements on large volume samples, using a 2-G ‘wholecore’ cryogenic magnetometer. Palaeomagnetic measurements on other, standard-sized samples were made with a CCL ‘discrete sample’ cryogenic magnetometer. Incremental thermal and AF demagnetisation treatment was used to remove magnetic overprints and to isolate the characteristic remanent magnetisation (ChRM). A reliability classification scheme has been developed and applied in this study, to provide an objective assessment of the quality of the palaeomagnetic results. IRM acquisition experiments suggest that the dominant magnetic mineral in these sediments is magnetite, but mixtures of hematite and magnetite occur also. SEM and TEM studies of magnetic mineral extracts indicate the presence of magnetite and hematite, preserved as inclusions within silicate grains, together with abundant bacterial magnetite preserved as individual grains and chains in some samples. Samples containing the greatest proportions of bacterial magnetite generally have the highest NRM intensity. The composite magnetic polarity sequence, derived by combining the data from all three sections, is characterised by three principal magnetic polarity zones which can be correlated with geomagnetic Chrons C34n, C33r and C33n, respectively. The positions of the chron boundaries have been tied to macrofossil and nannofossil biostratigraphic zones in these sections. A series of previously undocumented short magnetic polarity sub-chrons has been identified within the longer magnetochrons. These have potential value for high-resolution stratigraphic correlations and significance for theories of geodynamo behaviour.","","article","","156","","","The magnetostratigraphy of Coniacian-Late Campanian chalk sequences in southern England","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X98000089","0012-821X","1998","209-224","Earth and Planetary Science Letters"

Here, we address the relative importance of oceanic versus atmospheric inputs of Al, and the relationship with nutrient cycling, in a region of high biological productivity in coastal Antarctica. We investigate the concentrations of dissolved Al in seawater, sea ice, meteoric water and sediments collected from northern Marguerite Bay, off the West Antarctic Peninsula, from 2005 to 2006. Dissolved Al concentrations at 15 m water depth varied between 2 and 27 nM, showing a peak between two phytoplankton blooms. We find that, in this coastal setting, upwelling and incorporation of waters from below the surface mixed layer are responsible for this peak in dissolved Al as well as renewal of nutrients. This means that changes in the intensity and frequency of upwelling events may result in changes in biological production and carbon uptake. The waters below the mixed layer are most likely enriched in Al as a result of sea ice formation, either causing the injection of Al-rich brines or the resuspension of sediments and entrainment of pore fluids by brine cascades. Glacial, snow and sea ice melt contribute secondarily to the supply of Al to surface waters. Total particulate Al ranges from 93 to 2057 mg/g, and increases with meteoric water input towards the end of the summer, indicating glacial runoff is an important source of particulate Al. The (Al/Si)opal of sediment core top material is considerably higher than water column opal collected by sediment traps, indicative of a diagenetic overprint and incorporation of Al at the sediment–water interface. Opal that remains buried in the sediment could represent a significant sink of Al from seawater.","","article","","87","","","The role of sea ice formation in cycling of aluminium in northern Marguerite Bay, Antarctica","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771409006003","0272-7714","2010","103-112","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science"

However, observations of the rain gush phenomenon, a transient amplification in near-surface intensity after an overhead lightning also suggest that the lightning discharge can substantially enhance precipitation intensity at the ground. But the microphysical link between lightning and enhanced precipitation intensity after lightning is not well understood. With the observation of a transient amplification in the rain intensity and broadening of the corresponding Raindrop Size distribution (RDSD) after the lightning, it is inferred here that the lightning-induced atmospheric ions and prevailing electrical forces may potentially modulate the RDSD as well as the rain intensity by influencing the collision-coalescence process and the growth rate of raindrops after lightning. The time delay between the lightning and subsequent increase in rain intensity at the Earth's surface was observed to be between 2‐4 min. Also, a good correlation was observed between the variations in lightning frequency and the rain intensity during thunderstorms with an average time lag of 4 min. Piepgrass et al. (1982) have reported a good correlation between lightning frequency and rainfall when the precipitation lagged the lightning by times of 4 and 9 min. These observations indicate that the association between lightning frequency and rainfall with 4-min time lag (the shorter one) may be a result of the lightning-induced growth of raindrops below the melting layer rather than the enhancement in precipitation in the mixed phase region of cloud. The new knowledge, coupled with our related work (MUDIAR et al., 2018) on stratiform clouds provides a compelling basis for the parameterization of the electrical processes in weather/climate models.","","article","","259","","","Lightning and precipitation: The possible electrical modification of observed raindrop size distributions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809521002155","0169-8095","2021","105663","Atmospheric Research"

We evaluated the literature to find out if these metals act in humans as genotoxic carcinogens and if their health effects can be predicted by use of micronucleus (MN) assays with lymphocytes and/or with other genotoxicity tests. Numerous studies showed that lead and mercury induce cancer in humans and also in animals, in vitro experiments with cultured cells indicate that they cause DNA damage via different molecular mechanisms including release of reactive oxygen species and interactions with DNA repair processes. Also in most human studies, positive results were obtained in MN tests with lymphocytes (all 15 occupational studies with lead yielded positive results, with mercury 6 out of 7 investigations were positive). For cadmium, there is clear evidence that it causes cancer in humans; however, induction of chromosomal damage was only seen in high dose experiments with mammalian cells while results of animal and human studies yielded conflicting results (only in 2 of 5MN trials with humans positive findings were reported). Possibly, non-genotoxic mechanisms such as inhibition of apoptosis and interaction with signaling pathways account for the carcinogenic properties of cadmium species. The findings of MN studies with lead and mercury are in excellent agreement with results which were obtained with other endpoints (e.g. chromosomal aberrations and comet formations) and it is evident that this approach can be used for occupational and environmental monitoring of exposed individuals. Important future tasks will be the realization of larger studies with a uniform standardized protocol, the additional evaluation of anomalies other than MN (nuclear buds and bridges) and the combination of such trials with investigations which allow to define the molecular mechanisms relevant for exposed humans.","","article","","770","","","Results of micronucleus assays with individuals who are occupationally and environmentally exposed to mercury, lead and cadmium","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383574216300266","1383-5742","2016","119-139","Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research"

The peaks of pressure pulses are synchronous with the maximum gradient of areal strain decrease due to tidal load release. Microearthquakes with very near epicenters occur sporadically and do not appear to be directly correlatable to hydrothermal venting. Temporal variations in bottom water temperature also have semi-diurnal periodicity but are more complicated than the pressure events.

This study evaluates quadrennial, and seasonal surface ozone variations, ozone trends along with its significance through seasonal and deseasonal datasets, and ozone-NO2 correlation to codify a precedent for pollution control policies. China is divided into eight regions namely: Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), North (N), East (E), Central (C), South (S), Southwest (SW), and Tibet (T), to exploit four-years data via (a) ozone 8-hr moving averages (O3-8hr), (b) hourly ozone monthly mean (O3-MM), (c) hourly ozone daily maximum MM (O3-DM-MM), (d) mean of the daily maximum 8-hr average ozone (MDA8-O3), (e) hourly ozone averages (O3-1hr), and (f) hourly NO2 averages (NO2-1hr), respectively. Quadrennial variations show distinct regions (i) Northeast with daily upraised value of 164.59 μg/m3, (ii) North possessing increased monthly variation of 125 μg/m3, and (iii) Tibet containing maximum yearly value of 79.81 μg/m3, respectively. Seasonal variations outpace North and South regions. The highest and lowest values of seasonal variations in North region are 135.61 μg/m3, and 23.96 μg/m3 during summer and winter, while maximum values of South region are 87.98 μg/m3 in autumn. In trend analysis, the seasonal dataset highlights higher ozone values during autumn, i.e. 74.12 μg/m3 and 141.96 μg/m3 for South and Central regions, respectively. In the meantime, the deseasonal dataset reveals the presence of increasing ozone trends in all studied regions. In assessing statistical significance by Mann-Kendall test, seasonal dataset rolls out statistically insignificant trends with an exception of South region. Meanwhile, deseasonal dataset projects statistically significant trends in all the eight regions. Lastly, two continual regions North and South are selected to determine ozone-NO2 relationship. The multiple analytical approaches unveil that O3 has increased by 20.86%, 14.05% and 12.64% in North, Central and South regions. The dissimilar climate, land cover modifications, precursors transportation and vehicular emissions might be some of the rationales to give rise to regional ozone variations. Therefore, we suggest revamping of emissions control policies and their precise implementation to abate ozone pollution.","","article","","245","","","Quadrennial variability and trends of surface ozone across China during 2015–2018: A regional approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231020307226","1352-2310","2021","117989","Atmospheric Environment"

The current study evaluates the performance of 12 rainfall models available in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in reproducing observed rainfall over Kenya from 1979 to 2005. Several statistical metrics were deployed in quantifying the disparities between CMIP5 models, in situ, and the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC v7) rainfall datasets. The results show satisfactory skill of CMIP5 models' in simulating the bimodal rainfall regime despite exhibiting dry (wet) bias during March–May (MAM) and October–November (OND) season, respectively. The models' skills in reproducing the interannual variability is relatively weak. However, majority of the models captures the temporal pattern with reasonable skills in OND than in MAM and annual rainfall. The impacts of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) are marked in observed OND rains with no significance link in MAM rains. Overall, CMIP5 models' skills in replicating the mean statistics and teleconnection links are relatively weak. Remarkably, the performance of models at different time scale, metrics, simulation of dynamical and teleconnection patterns are inconsistent among models. Nevertheless, based on skill score, the models are listed from top to bottom as; MPI-ESM-MR, CSIRO-MK3-6-0, GISS-E2-R, MRI-CGCM2.3.3, EC-EARTH, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, FGOALS-g2, BCC-CSM1.1-M, HADGEM-AO, CanESM2, GFDL-ESM2G, IPSL-CM5A-MR, and MME model. This study sheds light on the use of statistical metrics and teleconnection pattern to rank CMIP5 models and forms basis on model selection. Model parameterization over tropics is prudent, and bias correction is paramount in future projections and impacts studies.","","article","","236","","","Gauging the performance of CMIP5 historical simulation in reproducing observed gauge rainfall over Kenya","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809519311639","0169-8095","2020","104808","Atmospheric Research"

A detailed undersea geological map has been edited chiefly by dredging and sonic prospecting. Carrying out offshore survey proved rather difficult, however, due to the water depth in the Tsugaru Straits, the fast tidal currents and the adverse weather conditions. Nonetheless, the results of the survey generally agreed with the actual geological conditions in terms of geographical formation sequence, major structure distribution, etc. In addition, the survey results were particularly effective in presenting the major geological features of primary importance, while greatly assisting in choosing the most appropriate design and construction work that followed.

The predominant tendency of continued worldwide glacier shrinkage may indeed constitute one of the clearest indications in nature of rapid climate change at a global scale. More than a century of systematic and internationally coordinated observations provide quantitative documentation of this development and a basis for model developments in view of possible future scenarios. Mountain ranges at lower latitudes have lost large percentages of their glacier areas and volumes since the end of the Little Ice Age. Many of them may even become largely to even completely de-glaciated already during the coming decades. Such changes have the potential to profoundly affect environmental conditions in and around cold mountain chains. Sea-level rise, changing seasonality in water supply, and local formation of new lakes reflect changes in the water cycle at global, continental, and regional to local scales. They are accompanied by rather marked changes in landscape appearance, slope stability, erosion/sedimentation, and hazard conditions. The monitoring of glaciers itself faces difficult challenges of vanishing glaciers with long-term mass-balance observations. Modern techniques of spatial modeling increasingly help with integrated analysis of observed phenomena and early anticipation of possible developments.","San Diego","incollection","Academic Press","","Treatise on Geomorphology","978-0-08-088522-3","13.10 Glacial Responses to Climate Change","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012374739600350X","","2013","152-175",""

Close examination of the fossil record reveals that many groups thought to be affected severely by this event, such as ammonoids, bivalves and conodonts, instead were in decline throughout the Late Triassic, and that other groups were relatively unaffected or subject to only regional effects. Explanations for the biotic turnover have included both gradualistic and catastrophic mechanisms. Regression during the Rhaetian, with consequent habitat loss, is compatible with the disappearance of some marine faunal groups, but may be regional, not global in scale, and cannot explain apparent synchronous decline in the terrestrial realm. Gradual, widespread aridification of the Pangaean supercontinent could explain a decline in terrestrial diversity during the Late Triassic. Although evidence for an impact precisely at the boundary is lacking, the presence of impact structures with Late Triassic ages suggests the possibility of bolide impact-induced environmental degradation prior to the end-Triassic. Widespread eruptions of flood basalts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) were synchronous with or slightly postdate the system boundary; emissions of CO2 and SO2 during these eruptions were substantial, but the contradictory evidence for the environmental effects of outgassing of these lavas remains to be resolved. A substantial excursion in the marine carbon-isotope record of both carbonate and organic matter suggests a significant disturbance of the global carbon cycle at the system boundary. Release of methane hydrates from seafloor sediments is a possible cause for this isotope excursion, although the triggering mechanism and climatic effects of such a release remain uncertain.","","article","","65","","","Assessing the record and causes of Late Triassic extinctions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825203000825","0012-8252","2004","103-139","Earth-Science Reviews"

The study is made up of three main pollution episodes characterized by very high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values with the presence of fine aerosol particles: the strongest long-range transport Canadian Biomass Burning (BB) event recorded, one of the longest-lasting European Anthropogenic (A) episodes and an extremely strong regional BB. The Canadian BB episode was unusually strong with maximum values of AOD(440 nm) ∼ 0.8, giving rise to the highest value recorded by photometer data in the IP with a clearly established Canadian origin. The anthropogenic pollution episode originated in Europe is mainly a consequence of the strong impact of Canadian BB events over north-central Europe. As regards the local episode, a forest fire in the nature reserve near the Duero River (north-central IP) impacted on the population over 200 km away from its source. These three episodes exhibited fingerprints in different aerosol columnar properties retrieved by sun-photometers of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) as well as in particle mass surface concentrations, PMx, measured by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). Main statistics, time series and scatterplots relate aerosol loads (aerosol optical depth, AOD and particulate matter, PM) with aerosol size quantities (Ångström Exponent and PM ratio). More detailed microphysical/optical properties retrieved by AERONET inversion products are analysed in depth to describe these events: contribution of fine and coarse particles to AOD and its ratio (the fine mode fraction), volume particle size distribution, fine volume fraction, effective radius, sphericity fraction, single scattering albedo and absorption optical depth. Due to its relevance in climate studies, the aerosol radiative effect has been quantified for the top and bottom of the atmosphere, obtaining mean daily values for this extraordinary summer period of −14.5 and −47.5 Wm−2, respectively.","","article","","184","","","An analysis of high fine aerosol loading episodes in north-central Spain in the summer 2013 - Impact of Canadian biomass burning episode and local emissions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231018302553","1352-2310","2018","191-202","Atmospheric Environment"

Marion Dufresne. The sections lie in the easternmost part of the Indian Ocean where the throughflow between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean emerges. They allow us to describe the features of the water-property and circulation fields of the throughflow at its entrance in the Indian Ocean. Between the Australian continental shelf and Bali, the Subtropical and Central waters are separated from the waters of the Indonesian seas by a sharp hydrological front, located around 13°30 S, below the thermocline down to 700 m. Near the coast of Bali, upwelling occurs in the near-surface layer under the effect of the southeast monsoon; at depth, between 300 m to more than 800 m, a water mass of northern Indian Ocean origin was present. From the characteristics of the bottom water found in the Lombok basin, the maximum depth of the Java ridge which separates the Lombok basin from the Northwest Australian basin lies around 3650 m. Off Sumba, Savu, Roti and Timor channels a core of low salinity and high oxygen content near-surface water was found in the axis of each channel, which suggests strong currents from the interior Indonesian seas towards the Indian Ocean. The entrance of the deep water flowing in the opposite direction, from the Indian Ocean to the Timor basin, was marked below 1400 m to the sill depth, through an increase of salinity and oxygen content. The flow reversal, observed briefly by a Pegasus direct current profiler in the Timor strait, was located at 1200 m depth. During the southeast monsoon, the net (geostrophic + Ekman) transport calculated on the section Australia-Bali give an estimate of the throughflow between 0 and 500 m of 22 ± 4 × 106 m3 s−1 towards the Indian Ocean, with a concentration of the transport in the upper layers (19 × 106 m3 s−1 in 0–200 m) and near the Indonesian coast, north of 13°30 S. In this region of intense mixing, attempts to make a salinity budget were inconclusive but did not imply any reduction in estimated throughflow transport. Below 500 m the net transport is of the order of the uncertainty. The total estimated transport (0–1900 dbar, deepest sill depth) is 18.6 × 106 m3 s−1 (±7) with a mean temperature of 23°C and a mean salinity of 34.0 psu (but may be as large as 23 × 106 m3 s−1, with mean temperature of 20°C and mean salinity of 34.1 psu).","","article","","41","","","Measurements within the Pacific-Indian oceans throughflow region","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0967063794900205","0967-0637","1994","1091-1130","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

The modal structure, diurnal, weekly and monthly patterns of particle number concentrations are analyzed. Long-term trends are quantified using seasonal-trend decomposition procedures based on “Loess”, Mann-Kendall regression with Theil-Sen slope and piecewise regression. Particle concentrations underwent significant (p<0.05) downward trends. An annual decrease of −323particles/cm3/y (−4.6%/y) was estimated for the total particle number concentration using Theil-Sen analysis. The trends were driven mainly by the decrease in particles in the 11–50nm range (−181particles/cm3/y; −4.7%/y). Slope changes were investigated annually and seasonally. Piecewise regression found different slopes for different portions of the overall period with the strongest declines between 2005 and 2011/2013, followed by small upward trends between 2013 and 2016 for most size bins, possibly representing increased vehicular traffic after the recovery from the 2008 recession.","","article","","633","","","Long-term trends in submicron particle concentrations in a metropolitan area of the northeastern United States","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718309112","0048-9697","2018","59-70","Science of The Total Environment"

Their insular location also results in much lower input of water and sediment than in nearby fiords on the mainland of Greenland that are affected by glaciers from the Greenland Ice Cap. Akulliit has a small drainage basin and low input of water and sediment; it is directly exposed to the higher energy wave environment of Baffin Bay. As a consequence, the mean thickness of Holocene glacimarine sediment assessed in acoustic records is less than 6 m in the inner and middle reaches of the fiord (mean Holocene accumulation, 0.4 mm/a) and about 11 m (1 mm/a) near the mouth. Dated core sediment indicates that rates are less than 0.5 mm/a in the outer fiord in the last 2 ka. The larger, more glacier-covered drainage basin of Kangerluk contributes much larger loads of sediment to a fiord environment protected from the open sea. As a result, Holocene glacimarine sediment is more than 80 m thick in the inner fiord (mean Holocene accumulation up to 5 mm/a), decreasing to 10–40 m (about 1 mm/a) in the middle reaches. Accumulation rates in Kangerluk are within the range of arctic fiords, including those of Baffin Island, but those in Akulliit are near the lower limit. The decrease in thickness distally in Kangerluk is typical of arctic fiords, but the opposite trend in Akulliit is probably due to erosion and re-distribution of sediment in the higher energy environment there.","","article","","147","","","Contrasting glacimarine sedimentary environments of two arctic fiords on Disko, West Greenland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322798000085","0025-3227","1998","63-83","Marine Geology"

The AERONET fine mode aerosol optical depth at 500 nm reached 0.77 and the Ångström exponent at 440–870 nm varied between 1.45 and 1.82, indicating the presence of fine smoke particles in the atmospheric column. In the beginning of the afternoon, the lidar profiles indicated the presence of a smoke layer followed by two thin layers of pollution mixed with dust and a lofted dust layer. The smoke particles caused low particle linear depolarization ratios at 532 nm with mean value of 0.059 ± 0.002 in the smoke layer. In contrast, the lofted dust layer caused mean particle linear depolarization ratio at 532 nm of 0.26 ± 0.01. Mass concentrations were in the order of 22–29 μg m−3 in the smoke layer and 60–178 μg m−3 in the lofted dust layer. During the afternoon and at night, mixing dust layers were identified by using lidar data. In the afternoon, two aerosol layers exhibited mean particle linear depolarization ratios at 532 nm of 0.23 ± 0.01 and 0.25 ± 0.01 with the dust dominating the extinction and mass concentration in both aerosol layers. Mass concentrations of dust were in the order of 101–266 μg m−3 and 159–195 μg m−3. At night, the particle linear depolarization ratio presented low variability across the identified layer with mean value of 0.20 ± 0.01. The Ångström exponents were low, the mean lidar ratios were 50 ± 6 sr (355 nm) and 42 ± 4 sr (532 nm) and the aerosol optical depth was 0.32 (355 nm) and 0.30 (532 nm). Mass concentrations ranged in 10–28 μg m−3 for non-dust and in 77–186 μg m−3 for dust.","","article","","252","","","Characterization of forest fire and Saharan desert dust aerosols over south-western Europe using a multi-wavelength Raman lidar and Sun-photometer","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231021001643","1352-2310","2021","118346","Atmospheric Environment"

Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness of the proposed sites is also assessed. The proposed number of stations could be considered as the basis to build the climatology of surface solar irradiance over Greece.","","article","","97","","","Determination of measuring sites for solar irradiance, based on cluster analysis of satellite-derived cloud estimations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X13003150","0038-092X","2013","1-11","Solar Energy"

Organic carbon was the most prominent aerosol type found at all altitudes. Refractory black carbon aerosols which constituted about 10–12% of the aerosols in the boundary layer were primarily internally mixed with both inorganic and organic coating. Other major aerosol types were dust and sea salt, with the latter primarily found below 2 km. Further, the cloud forming ability of in-situ aerosols is tested through a cloud condensation nuclei closure analysis. The effective hygroscopicity decreased above cloud base due to the absence of sea salt aerosols. The change in large-scale winds with altitude affected the aerosol composition and hygroscopicity. The multimodal aerosol size distribution and hygroscopicity parameter (κ = 0.18) obtained for the cloud base aerosols over the rain shadow region are useful for studying aerosol-cloud interactions using regional cloud-resolving models.","","article","","262","","","Vertical profile of aerosol characteristics including activation over a rain shadow region in India","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231021004751","1352-2310","2021","118653","Atmospheric Environment"

Continuous records of past fluctuations in GIC size provide information on the timing and magnitude of Holocene climate shifts, and a longer-term perspective on 21st century glacier retreat. Although there is broad-scale agreement on millennial-scale trends in Holocene climate variability and fluctuations in local GICs in Greenland, regional variations are only loosely constrained. Here we present three Holocene proglacial lake sediment records from South Greenland, an area with abundant local glaciers but few Holocene-length paleoclimate records. In addition, we use geospatial analysis to model past equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) and thereby constrain the magnitude of ablation-season temperature change during the warmest and coolest periods of the Holocene. Physical and geochemical sedimentary characteristics show that two of the proglacial lakes continued to receive glacial meltwater input until ∼7.3 and ∼7.1 ka BP. The survival of local glaciers implies that South Greenland remained relatively cool, and that summer temperatures gradually warmed, but did not warm well beyond 1.2 °C above present in the early Holocene. In the mid-Holocene, from ∼7.1 to 5.5 ka BP, organic sedimentation at these two sites indicates that local glaciers became very small, or more likely melted away completely. The glaciers within the third lake’s catchment melted away prior to ∼5.2 ka BP, as sediments deposited earlier in the Holocene could not be dated at this site. We estimate that summer temperatures increased by at least 1.2–1.8 °C above present by ∼7.3–7.1 ka BP. Our results are consistent with other observations that suggest a north-to-south gradient in the timing of Holocene thermal maximum conditions, with southern Greenland experiencing a delayed warming relative to other regions in Greenland. As summer temperatures cooled in the Neoglacial, our records show that sustained glacier regrowth began ∼3.1 ka BP with glaciers in the southernmost catchment, which at present, receive the most precipitation. In the other two catchments, which host smaller glaciers in a drier environment, regrowth began at ∼1.3 and ∼1.2 ka BP, the timing of which is in agreement with other glacial records from the Arctic Atlantic region. Local glaciers reached their maximum late Holocene extents during a cooler, second phase of the Little Ice Age (LIA) ∼0.2-0.1 ka BP, that we estimate was at least 0.4–0.9 °C cooler than present. Overall, these findings improve understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Holocene glacier and climate change in Greenland, potentially yielding valuable information about their future response.","","article","","241","","","Local glaciers record delayed peak Holocene warmth in south Greenland","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379120303838","0277-3791","2020","106421","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Adult sea urchins were exposed to effluents from HFO-oiled gravel columns for 7 days to simulate an oil-contaminated gravel shore, and then gametes of adult sea urchins were used to produce embryos to determine developmental toxicity. For adult sea urchins, no significant difference in the somatic size and weight was found between the various oil loadings tested, while the gonad weight and gonad index were significantly decreased at higher oil loadings. The spawning ability of adults and fecundity of females significantly decreased. For gametes, no effect was observed on the egg size and fertilization success in any of the groups. However, a significant increase in the percentage of anomalies in the offspring was observed and then quantified by an integrative toxicity index (ITI) at 24 and 48 h post fertilization. The offspring from exposed parents showed higher ITI values with more malformed embryos. The results confirmed that parental exposure to HFO can cause adverse effects on the offspring and consequently affect the recruitment and population maintenance of sea urchins.","","article","","159","","","Parental exposure to heavy fuel oil induces developmental toxicity in offspring of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651318303671","0147-6513","2018","109-119","Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety"

Microalgae were exposed to increasing concentrations of Cu2+ (10−4 to 31 nM) or BuT (0.084 to 84 nM) for seven days. When considering the growth, EC50 values were 0.16 (±0.09) nM and 0.03 (±0.02) nM of Cu2+ for A. catenella and O. cf. ovata, respectively. Regarding BuT, EC50 was 14.2 (±6) nM for O. cf. ovata, while A. catenella growth inhibition appeared at BuT concentrations ≥27 nM. Photosynthetic activity of the studied dinoflagellates decreased with increasing Cu and BuT concentrations. For O. cf. ovata, the response of this physiological parameter to contamination was less sensitive than the biomass. Cu exposure induced the formation of temporary cysts in both organisms that could resist adverse conditions. The ovatoxin-a and -b concentrations in O. cf. ovata cells increased significantly in the presence of Cu. Altogether, the results suggest a better tolerance of the planktonic A. catenella to Cu and BuT. This could result in a differentiated selection pressure exerted by these metals on phytoplankton species in highly polluted waters. The over-production of toxins in response to Cu stress could pose supplementary health and socio-economic threats in the contaminated marine ecosystems where HABs develop.","","article","","196","","","Effects of copper and butyltin compounds on the growth, photosynthetic activity and toxin production of two HAB dinoflagellates: The planktonic Alexandrium catenella and the benthic Ostreopsis cf. ovata","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X18300055","0166-445X","2018","154-167","Aquatic Toxicology"

The study period is October–December 2010 covered by a large number of data. The nonlinear model is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and the data assimilation component on the four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) algorithm. Assimilation proceeds in a series of 7-day windows, providing an analysis solution in each window. The assimilation of surface velocity combined with other observations has more utility in recovering the density fields based on the theory of geostrophic adjustment and a strong impact both on near-surface horizontal volume fluxes and subsurface flows, constraining surface geostrophic currents in the area not covered by the HF radar data. The adjoint of the 4D-Var gain matrix was used to quantify the impact of individual observations and observation platforms on different aspects of the 4D-Var circulation estimates during both the analysis and subsequent forecast cycles. In this study, we focus on the alongshore transport of the surface and intermediate waters in the eastern zone of southern Tyrrhenian Sea. The majority of the observations available during any given analysis cycle are from HF radar, and on average these data, together with SSH data, exert the largest controlling influence on the analysis increments of coastal transport. Also, observations from satellite platforms in the form of SST have a considerable impact on analyses and forecasts of coastal transport, even though these observations represent a relatively small fraction of the available data at any particular time. During 4D-Var, the observations are used to correct for uncertainties in the model control variables, namely, the initial conditions, surface forcing, and open boundary conditions. It is found that correcting for uncertainties in the initial conditions and only secondarily in the boundary conditions has the largest impact on the analysis increments in alongshore transport. Finally, we note that both the control vector and the observation impact calculations are a useful way for monitoring the performance of the data assimilation system, as well as quantifying the impact of the observations on the circulation estimates.","","article","","154","","","Impacts of a 4-dimensional variational data assimilation in a coastal ocean model of southern Tyrrhenian Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092479631500158X","0924-7963","2016","157-171","Journal of Marine Systems"

This area is affected by relevant environmental pressures related to subsidence, groundwater salinization and industrial contamination. The occurrence of rare earth elements (REE), and the characterization of processes that control their migration in the water–soil system were performed for implementing the knowledge of the present environmental status in the area. Nine soil profiles were opened in the Pineta San Vitale and each horizon was characterized. In the parent material, dominant quartz, followed by plagioclase, mica, chlorite and calcite were recognized by XRD. Topsoil samples were characterized by neutral or sub-acid pH, relatively high organic carbon content (LOI up to 43wt.%; TOC: 38÷61g/kg), and low carbonate (11÷20g/kg CaCO3). Subsoil horizons were sub-alkaline or moderately alkaline, rich in carbonate (up to 114g/kg CaCO3), and depleted in organic matter. The electrical conductivity (EC: 0.2÷4.2 mS/cm) values along the soil profiles did depend on the water table fluctuations and the salinity of groundwater. Sequential extraction tests on two soil profiles showed the highest Y and ΣREE occurrence in the residual fraction of soils, with values generally increasing at depth, and total amounts similar to values estimated in the upper continental crust (UCC). Poor fractionation of REE was observed when the bulk soil horizon was considered, but different REE patterns occurred in the organic, oxide, and carbonate soil fractions, suggesting REE fractionation during weathering and pedogenic processes. Physical–chemical parameters and concentrations of total and dissolved elements were determined in 44 water samples. Waters showed near-neutral or slightly alkaline pH (6.8÷8.0) and total dissolved solids mostly in the range of 2 to 24g/L, with values increasing with increasing seawater influence. Concentrations of ΣREE determined in waters filtered through 0.4μm pore size filters varied from 0.1 to 189μg/L (0.7·10−9÷1.3·10−6mol/L ΣREE), with the highest values observed in soil waters. REE values were not related to salinity, nor to major ions, while were positively correlated to Al concentrations. Further filtration through 0.015μm pore size filters removed about 90% of REE compared to the 0.4μm filtered samples, i.e. the studied waters showed a small quantity of truly dissolved REE species. Speciation modeling results by Visual MINTEQ indicated that truly dissolved REE species are dominated by bi-dentate organic complexes in the soil waters rich in dissolved organic carbon (up to 74mg/L DOC); aqueous complex with the carbonate and bicarbonate ligands increased in waters having low DOC. UCC-normalized patterns of REE in the colloidal fraction of soil waters showed slight enrichments in the middle REE (MREE), likely due to preferential adsorption of the MREE onto <0.4μm particles. UCC-normalized patterns of REE truly dissolved in soil waters showed slight enrichments in the heavy REE (HREE), probably due to dominant low molecular weight DOC in the truly dissolved fraction. For evaluating the potential REE contribution from the atmosphere, 12 vegetation samples (ivy leaves) were submitted to leaching tests using acidulated water as a proxy of rain water. The REE leached from leaves were in the range of 0.5 to 10μg/kg ΣREE, suggesting a significant atmospheric contribution to the water–soil system. UCC-normalized patterns of REE leached from leaves were nearly flat, possibly indicating a dominant geogenic source of atmospheric REE.","","article","","193-194","","","Dynamics of rare earth elements in water–soil systems: The case study of the Pineta San Vitale (Ravenna, Italy)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706112003515","0016-7061","2013","52-67","Geoderma"

We find abundant and continuous presence of arboreal pollen (chiefly Nothofagus) during the LGM, accompanied by other trees, shrubs, and alpine herbs. These results suggest Subantarctic parkland and/or scattered woodlands under a cold and hyperhumid climate during the LGM (∼25,000–17,800 cal. yr BP) with expansion of Nothofagus under relatively warm interstadial conditions between 25,000 and 19,200 cal. yr BP. This was followed by cooling and a precipitation increase between 19,200 and 17,800 cal. yr BP, which was contemporaneous with the youngest LGM advance of Andean glaciers in the region and maximum influence of the Southern Westerly Wind (SWW). The Last Glacial Termination (T1) started at 17,800 cal. yr BP and featured the spread of thermophilous trees and ferns characteristic of North Patagonian rainforests, along with lake level lowering. These results suggest a warm pulse and southward shift of the SWW, concurrent with a rapid collapse of Andean glacier lobes. Subsequent changes led to the establishment of closed-canopy rainforests under peak interstadial warmth between ∼16,000 and 15,000 cal. yr BP. We detect a shift to cold/wet conditions during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,800–12,700 cal. yr BP) and a precipitation decline during Younger Dryas time, followed by maximum temperature, relatively lower lake level and minimum SWW influence between 11,300 and 7700 cal. yr BP. Precipitation then rose punctuated by centennial-scale variations since 6200 cal. yr BP. Chilean-European deforestation and spread of invasive exotic species started at ∼350 cal. yr BP aided by fire. We conclude that temperate rainforests have persisted with little interruption since T1, with major changes in floristic composition driven by climate change and fires. Rainforest composition and heterogeneity declined in response to Chilean/European disturbance during the 1600s and intensified since the 1800s.

A new class of advanced small satellites, including autonomously operating “intelligent” satellites may be created, opening new fields of application. The increasing number of small satellites and their applications drive developments in the fields of small launchers, small ground station networks, cost-effective data distribution methods, and cost-effective management and quality assurance procedures. There are many advantages of small satellite missions, like more frequent mission opportunities, a faster return of data, larger variety of missions, more rapid expansion of the technical and/or scientific knowledge base, greater involvement of small industry, feasibility by universities and others. This paper deals with general trends in the field of small satellite missions for Earth observation. Special attention is given to the potential of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of small satellite based systems. Examples show small satellites offer also the unique possibility to install affordable constellations to provide good daily coverage of the globe and/or allow us to observe dynamic phenomena.

Pesticides were selected to give a gradient of solubility in water between 7 and 93mgL−1, comprising azoxystrobin (emulsifiable concentrate, EC, and suspension concentrate, SC), cyproconazole (SC), propyzamide (SC) and triadimenol (EC). Columns of sandy loam soil were leached with 6 pore volumes of 0.01M CaCl2 either 1 or 7days after treatment. Separate experiments evaluated leaching of triadimenol to full breakthrough following addition of 18 pore volumes of 0.01M CaCl2. The mass of pesticide leached from columns treated with commercial formulation was significantly larger than that from columns treated with technical material for all compounds studied and for both leaching intervals (two-sided t-tests, p<0.001). This difference was conserved when triadimenol was leached to full breakthrough with 79±1.2 and 61±3.1% of applied triadimenol leached from columns treated with formulated and technical material, respectively. There were highly significant effects of formulation for all pesticides (two-way ANOVA, p<0.001), whereas leaching interval was only significant for azoxystrobin EC formulation and cyproconazole (p<0.001 and 0.021, respectively) with greater leaching when irrigation commenced 1day after treatment. Leaching of azoxystrobin increased in the order technical material (6.0% of applied pesticide)<SC formulation (8.5–9.1% of applied)<EC formulation (15.8–21.0% of applied). The relative difference between leaching of formulated and technical pesticide increased with pesticide solubility in water, increasing from a factor of 1.4 for the SC formulation of azoystrobin to 4.3 for the SC formulation of triadimenol. Experimental systems differ markedly from field conditions (small columns with intense irrigation). Nevertheless, results indicate the need to consider further the influence of co-formulants in pesticide formulations on behaviour of the active ingredient in soil.","","article","","573","","","Influence of commercial formulation on leaching of four pesticides through soil","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716319957","0048-9697","2016","1573-1579","Science of The Total Environment"

Our results did not support the existence of current competitive displacement by the exotic species. The presence of C. fragile was clearly seasonal, while the native C. tomentosum was more persistent throughout the year, due to a higher frequency of frond sprouting from perennial basal fragments. However, our results also indicated an increase in the proportion of C. fragile relative to native species towards inner areas of the Bay of Biscay, which was correlated with environmental gradients. The greater tolerance of C. fragile to environmental stress and its opportunistic abilities may favour establishment and spread of the species under a warming scenario.","","article","","140","","","Spatio-temporal dynamics of Codium populations along the rocky shores of N and NW Spain","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141113618302460","0141-1136","2018","394-402","Marine Environmental Research"

When possible, glider tracks were synchronized with the contemporaneous footprints of the Jason-2, SARAL/AltiKa and CryoSat-2 altimeters. Temperature and salinity measured by the gliders that were co-localised with the altimeter passages were used to calculate along-track dynamic heights (DH). The latter were then compared with the altimeters’ near real-time absolute dynamic topography (ADT) measurements. ADT and DH values showed very similar, but shifted patterns, suggesting that gliders had sampled the same structures but at different times. Average surface absolute geostrophic velocities at the time of glider transit were used in a novel relocation technique to reposition glider measurements where they would have been at the time of the altimeter passage. The relocation increases the correlation between datasets to a value close to 1 and reduces the RMSE of an order of magnitude, also when the time-difference between measurements was greater than 3 days. The sea level spatial and temporal variability is attributed to the presence of meanders generated by the baroclinic instability of the Liguro- Provençal Current (LPC). These meanders are characterized by a 38 km amplitude and 0.12 m s−1 average propagation speed that are confirmed by the larger scale ocean colour measurements and are in agreement with those previously described in the literature. We found that the presence of LPC meanders in along-track ADT and DH measurements is evidenced by a decrease in sea level when profiles sampled the Modified Atlantic Water, and an increase in sea level when measurements sampled the adjacent waters of Tyrrhenian Sea origin. The relocation technique introduced here is expected to improve future altimetry-glider comparisons, as similar validation experiments were considered possible only when glider and altimetry measurements were near synoptic, and collected up to one day from each other.","","article","","145","","","Understanding altimetry signals in the Northeastern Ligurian sea using a multi-platform approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063717302571","0967-0637","2019","83-96","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

Although SO2 is the prevailing component of the emissions, it is only part of a much more complex chemical emission spectrum in the region. In addition to acidic gases, industry also emits potentially toxic elements (e.g. metals) which being less volatile than SO2, are deposited within the immediate region in significant concentrations. Additionally, it appears that sources of base cations (co-emission by smelters, sea aerosols, other industries) are adequate to prevent environmental acidification on the regional scale. Acidification of soils and waters appeared only as single cases in the immediate vicinity of the smelters and is not believed to be a major mechanism of environmental deterioration. Proposed critical concentrations (5 μg/m3) of SO2 for the northern ecosystems are exceeded over a large area and direct exposure to SO2 is believed to be the possible mechanism of vegetation damage.","","article","","124","","","Sulphur in the Arctic environment (3): environmental impact","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749102004013","0269-7491","2003","151-171","Environmental Pollution"

The turbulent dissipation rates and associated mixing were estimated and analyzed using a multidisciplinary approach that combines physical and geochemical in-situ observations: (1) direct measurements of the dissipation using a microstructure profiler, (2) use of density-based fine-scale methods applied to CTD and XCTD data, and (3) study of the vertical distribution of natural radionuclides (radium isotopes and actinium-227). Data were collected at five contrasting stations within the Indonesian archipelago, found above energetic straits or in relatively quiescent large basins. Strong instabilities, inversions of the density profiles and a very strong water mass transformation were observed. A wide range of dissipation values were obtained (between [10−10, 10−4]Wkg−1) with spots of higher dissipation in the ocean interior correlated with a strong internal tide signal. Both the fine-scale and micro-scale methods allow us to identify very strong energy dissipation levels above the straits, ranging between [10−7, 10−4]Wkg−1, in contrast to lower values at stations further away from the generation sites. The dissipation for the station located in the center of the Halmahera Sea ([10−9, 10−8]Wkg−1) is stronger than for the Banda station ([10−11, 10−10]Wkg−1), which is even further away from the generation sites. The three approaches agree relatively well and provide vertical eddy diffusivities values ranging between 5×10−4 and 5×10−1m2s−1, except in the Banda Sea where values are similar to the ones found in the open ocean (10−6m2s−1). CTD and XCTD profilers (deployed between stations) give estimates of dissipation all along the transit. It is found that enhanced mixing occurs preferentially above rough topography, such as in the Ombai Strait, the Halmahera Sea’s northern entrance, the Buru strait and Sumba strait. Finestructure parameters are very sensitive to depth and dissipation, which differs between stations. We recommend more systematic microstructure measurement in order to tune these parameters. Surface mixing, at the base of the mixed layer is found to be very strong with values between [10−4, 10−3m2s−1]. These results confirm the modeling studies that suggest the occurrence of intensified subsurface mixing which cools the sea surface temperatures and thus strongly affects the mean and variability of the tropical climate. We conclude, therefore, that climate models need to take into account this intensified ocean mixing to properly represent the mean state of the atmosphere and its climate variability.","","article","","106","","","Estimates of tidal mixing in the Indonesian archipelago from multidisciplinary INDOMIX in-situ data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063715001648","0967-0637","2015","136-153","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

The simultaneous measurement of many parameters that influence CO2 uptake makes it possible to relate the CO2 exchange to recent changes in e.g. temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration. The net CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured by the eddy covariance method. Ecosystem respiration (RE) was estimated from nighttime values and gross ecosystem exchange (GEE) was calculated as the sum of RE and NEE. Over the years the beech forest acted as a sink of on average of 157gCm−2yr−1. In one of the years only, the forest acted as a small source. During 1996–2009 a significant increase in annual NEE was observed. A significant increase in GEE and a smaller and not significant increase in RE was also found. Thus the increased NEE was mainly attributed to an increase in GEE. The overall trend in NEE was significant with an average increase in uptake of 23gCm−2yr−2. The carbon uptake period (i.e. the period with daily net CO2 gain) increased by 1.9days per year, whereas there was a non significant tendency of increase of the leafed period. This means that the leaves stayed active longer. The analysis of CO2 uptake by the forest by use of light response curves, revealed that the maximum rate of photosynthetic assimilation increased by 15% during the 14-year period. We conclude that the increase in the overall CO2 uptake of the forest is due to a combination of increased growing season length and increased uptake capacity. We also conclude that long time series of flux measurements are necessary to reveal trends in the data because of the substantial inter-annual variation in the flux.","","article","","151","","","Increasing net CO2 uptake by a Danish beech forest during the period from 1996 to 2009","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192311000797","0168-1923","2011","934-946","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context.

Here we reported the trend in gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations at LABS between April 2006 and December 2016, before the Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force in 2017. Previous research indicated nighttime (0–8 am) data collected at LABS are better representative of regional influence. Therefore, only nighttime GEM data were used for trend analysis. A significant decreasing trend in GEM at a rate of −1.5% yr−1 (−0.022 ng m−3 yr−1, p < 0.01) was found, comparable to the decreasing trends observed in Europe, North America, South Africa, and over the North Atlantic Ocean. Five major GEM source regions to the LABS were identified, including northern Indochina Peninsula, China, Northeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and South China Sea. Significant decreasing trends in GEM were found for air masses coming from northern Indochina Peninsula (−0.042 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.6% yr−1, p < 0.01), China (−0.041 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.4% yr−1, p < 0.01), Northeast Asia (−0.031 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.0% yr−1, p < 0.05), and the Pacific Ocean (−0.022 ng m−3 yr−1, −1.7% yr−1, p < 0.05). Decreasing GEM trend (−0.020 ng m−3 yr−1, −1.5% yr−1), but insignificant (p > 0.05), was also found for air masses coming from South China Sea. The decreasing trends observed with air from the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea indicated declining background GEM concentrations in Northern Hemisphere. Decrease in GEM concentrations at the LABS was in agreement with the reduction in atmospheric Hg export from the East Asia continent caused by changes in Hg emission quantity and speciation, and temporal and spatial distribution in emission sources that have been suggested by recent research. Additionally, changes in the frequency distribution of air mass origins and transport paths may also contribute to the changes in GEM concentrations at LABS.","","article","","686","","","Temporal changes in atmospheric mercury concentrations at a background mountain site downwind of the East Asia continent in 2006–2016","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719324799","0048-9697","2019","1049-1056","Science of The Total Environment"

The measurement of safety was found challenging with inconsistencies in safety quantification approaches. The safe route-finding algorithms were investigated based on their predictive/reactive, static/dynamic, and centralized/decentralized characteristics. Based on the critical review of the safe route-finding algorithms, availability of real-time data sources, accurate real-time and disaggregated crash risk prediction models, trade-off between time and safety in road navigation tools, and centralized safe route-finding are highlighted as the requirements and challenges in considering safety in road navigation systems.

In such an environment, a minor error in combination with weak barrier systems could lead to an unexpected accident. If a human error induced accident has failed to be prevented from occurring despite multiple barriers in place, then we should look for problems underlying in our organization. In the nuclear industry, however, accident cause analyses have been mostly focused on failed equipment, improper designs, or personal mistakes. In order to prevent recurrence, detailed cause analysis and timely corrective actions are crucial. It is also necessary to disseminate the lessons learned (i.e. operating experience) from accident analyses throughout the organization. High-reliability industries have experienced numerous near-misses and minor problems that might have otherwise resulted in major accidents. Due to organizational culture, however, lessons learned from such issues were often overlooked or considered insignificant to ensure that weaknesses could be identified in terms of safety culture (or organizational management). Therefore, methods are necessary to help analyze accidents in terms of safety culture. This paper proposes an accident analysis model based on a Bayesian network that can be used to quantitatively analyze root causes of an accident (or event) occurring at a nuclear power plant from the perspective of nuclear safety culture rather than equipment. For the purpose of this study, a case study was conducted on those actual events that had occurred at nuclear power plants. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the safety culture attributes categorized into individual, manager and system layers, which discovered more effective attributes for preventing accidents at nuclear power plants. If the analysis results of accidents (or events) at nuclear power plants based on this model are collected in an organization's database, the data may be used to monitor nuclear safety culture degradation signs and contribute to enhanced plant safety.","","article","","166","","","A quantitative accident analysis model on nuclear safety culture based on Bayesian network","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645492100579X","0306-4549","2022","108703","Annals of Nuclear Energy"

As an effective method for reducing carbon emissions, carbon dioxide (CO2) storage and utilization on the seabed enable the transport of captured CO2 via pipelines or ships to permanent storage sites, such as saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs in subsea sediments, or by injecting CO2 for the replacement and displacement of subsea resources (oil, gas, gas hydrates, etc.). Subsea CO2 utilization and storage (SCUS) involves several research hotspots worldwide, including international and local laws and regulations, security, economics, environmental impact, and public acceptance. Its current research and engineering progress are also of great interest. In addition, the vigorous implementation of the energy transition and the rapid development of renewable energy sources globally have resulted in significant advancements in SCUS. This paper provides an overview of carbon dioxide storage and utilization mechanism in the seabed, analyzes key technical and economic issues, and summarizes existing research on safety risks, monitoring technologies, and investment and operating cost control to identify remaining knowledge gaps. This is followed by an overview of global engineering practice to update on current progress. Finally, combined with the actualities of China, the potential and trend of China's seabed carbon storage and utilization are summarized. This review demonstrates the enormous development prospects for seabed carbon storage and utilization, although some risks remain including leakage and contamination, with which innovation in monitoring technologies and the self-sealing effect of gas hydrate, safe subsea utilization and storage of CO2 can be achieved. Additionally, considering the development of renewable energy and the demand for large-scale energy storage, hydrogen, ammonia, or other energy carriers and carbon dioxide storage and utilization can be coupled into an industrial chain to form an economically competitive carbon geological storage mode.","","article","","2","","","Advances in subsea carbon dioxide utilization and storage","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772970223000032","2772-9702","2023","100016","Energy Reviews"

Elevated 85Kr concentrations observed in spring and fall of 1995–1997 are the result of two factors, the operation of the PNC Tokai nuclear plant and secondly the seasonal change of prevailing wind directions. Elevated 85Kr levels arising from releases of the Tokai plant are interpreted in a semi-quantitative fashion using the daily 85Kr release data and available meteorological data. During periods without the influence of the Tokai plant, 85Kr background concentrations (1.3Bq/m3 of air) are similar to those for latitudes between 35 and 40°N. Background concentrations show a continuous increase with time and pronounced seasonal variations. The yearly increase rate of about 2.5% observed between 1996 and 1998 is very similar to European observations. The features of the seasonal variations are minimum values during summer and maximum values during winter. 133Xe concentrations are not influenced by major local sources. One observation of a high 133Xe concentration in June 1996 can be interpreted as originating from a Chinese underground nuclear test conducted earlier in the same month.","","article","","48","","","85Kr and 133Xe monitoring at MRI, Tsukuba and its importance","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X99000764","0265-931X","2000","191-202","Journal of Environmental Radioactivity"

The known focal mechanisms indicate a general E–W extension, consistent with the stretching currently observed in the Mozambique channel and on the eastern edge of the African continent. Seismic areas cover the main Pliocene–Quaternary tectonic formations. Other events are located near Pan-African tectonics structures, preferentially reactivated within the Precambrian basement complex. A regional origin of stresses cannot explain completely the spatial distribution of all the earthquakes in the central highlands of Madagascar. An other possible stress origin can be a thermal bulge on which the main Pliocene Quaternary tectonic and volcanic structures of this region are situated. The current tectonic phase of extension seems to correspond to an early stage of reactivation.

Unlike strictly physical systems, cyber-enabled physical systems are influenced by dynamic and evolving technologies, environments, and attack mechanisms. As a result, vulnerabilities are rapidly changing and difficult to detect and manage. While there is recent interest in the dynamic properties of performance through resilience analysis, limited research addresses the dynamic nature of cyber-system vulnerability. This paper presents an iterative data-driven learning approach to evaluate and manage vulnerabilities for such complex systems. These time-varying system health characteristics may not be directly observable, but can be inferred using observable indicators. The approach recognizes that multiple types of vulnerabilities need to be included in a holistic system health assessment. The methods are applied to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) database containing thousands of documented cybersecurity vulnerabilities over nearly two decades. We acknowledge the dynamic properties of cyber vulnerability, while also inferring system health using observable data and hidden operational states. The results will be of interest to managers of large-scale cyber-enabled physical systems who are seeking to prioritize system health investments.","","article","","193","","","An iterative learning and inference approach to managing dynamic cyber vulnerabilities of complex systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832018314558","0951-8320","2020","106664","Reliability Engineering & System Safety"

GMES is designed to provide European policy makers and public authorities with accurate and timely information to better manage the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. Sentinel-3 is an Earth observation satellite mission specifically designed for GMES to ensure the long-term collection and operational delivery of high-quality measurements to GMES ocean, land, and atmospheric services, while contributing to the GMES, emergency and security services. Key Sentinel-3 measurement requirements, corresponding to identified GMES user needs, have been derived as follows:•Sea surface topography (SSH), significant wave height (Hs) and surface wind speed derived over the global ocean to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by ENVISAT Radar Altimeter-2 (RA-2) but with enhanced surface topography measurements in the coastal zone, sea ice regions and over inland rivers, their tributaries and lakes.•Sea surface temperature (SST) determined for oceanic and coastal waters globally to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by the ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) over the ocean (i.e. <0.3K), at a spatial resolution of 1km.•Visible, and Short-Wave Infrared radiances for oceanic, inland and coastal waters at a spatial resolution of 0.3km (simultaneously and co-registered with SST measurements), determined to an equivalent level of accuracy and precision as ENVISAT Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer with complete ocean coverage in 2–3days.•Visible and infrared radiances over global land-surfaces in 1–2days, sea-ice and ice-sheets equivalent to those currently provided from ENVISAT MERIS, AATSR and Système Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) Vegetation. The Sentinel-3 mission addresses these requirements by implementing and operating:•A dual frequency, Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) instrument supported by a dual frequency passive microwave radiometer (MWR) for wet-tropospheric correction, a Precise Orbit Determination package including a GPS receiver, a DORIS instrument and a laser retro-reflector.•A highly sensitive Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) delivering multi-channel wide-swath optical measurements for ocean and land surfaces.•A dual-view Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) delivering accurate surface ocean, land, and ice temperature.•A collaborative ground segment providing management of the mission, management, development, production and access to core data products in an operational near real time delivery context. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having 7-year lifetime, over a 20-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-3A in late 2013 and of Sentinel-3B in late 2014. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180°.

Although microbes other than bacteria may exhibit magnetotaxis, it is most well recognized and studied in bacteria. Magnetotactic bacteria are Gram-negative, mostly aquatic, motile prokaryotes that biomineralize intracellular magnetic crystals of the iron oxide magnetite and/or iron sulfide minerals (greigite and precursors). Each crystal is enveloped by a lipid-bilayer membrane and comprises the organelle referred to as the magnetosome. Magnetosomes are usually organized in chains within the cell and cause the bacterium to orient and swim along the Earth's geomagnetic field lines, being propelled by flagella. Microorganisms apparently use the Earth's magnetic field to increase the efficiency of chemotaxis in locating and maintaining an optimal position in vertical chemical and redox gradients. Magnetotactic bacteria are indigenous in sediments or water columns where they occur predominantly at the oxic–anoxic interface and the anoxic zone. They represent a diverse group of microorganisms with respect to morphology, physiology, and phylogeny.

Direct measurements, such as those provided by lysimeters, eddy flux instrumentation or Bowen-ratio instrumentation, give point values, require constant attendance by skilled personnel and are based on unverified assumptions. A critical review of the methods used for estimating areal evapotranspiration indicates that the conventional conceptual techniques, such as those used in current watershed models, are based on assumptions that are completely divorced from reality; and that causal techniques based on processes and interactions in the soil-plant-atmosphere system are not likely to prove useful for another generation. However, the complementary relationship can do much to fill the gap until such time as causal techniques become practicable because it provides the basis for models that permit areal evapotranspiration to be estimated from its effects on the routine climatological observations needed to estimate potential evapotranspiration. Such models have a realistic conceptual and empirical basis, by-pass the complexity of the soil-plant system and require no local calibration of coefficients. Therefore, they are falsifiable (i.e. can be tested rigorously) so that errors in the associated assumptions and relationships can be detected and corrected by progressive testing over an ever-widening range of environments. Such a methodology uses the entire world as a laboratory and requires that a correction made to obtain agreement between model and river-basin water budget estimates in one environment must be applicable without modification in all other environment. The most recent version of the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration (CRAE) models is formulated and documented. The reliability of the independent operational estimates of areal evapotranspiration is tested with comparable long-term water-budget estimates for 143 river basins in North America, Africa, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The practicality and potential impact of such estimates are demonstrated with examples which show how the availability of such estimates can revitalize the science and practice of hydrology by providing a reliable basis for detailed water-balance studies; for further research on the development of causal models; for hydrological, agricultural and fire hazard forecasts; for detecting the development of errors in hydrometeorological records; for detecting and monitoring the effects of land-use changes; for explaining hydrologic anomalies; and for other better known applications. It is suggested that the collection of the required climatological data by hydrometric agencies could be justified on the grounds that the agencies would gain a technique for quality control and the users would gain by a significant expansion in the information content of the hydrometric data, all at minimal additional expense.","","article","","66","","","Operational estimates of areal evapotranspiration and their significance to the science and practice of hydrology","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169483901774","0022-1694","1983","1-76","Journal of Hydrology"

Although the multi-channel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles recorded along the central axial graben and ridge, where the most active hydrothermal activities were observed and medium to fast crustal spreading rate was implied, do not show clear structural evidence of the axial magma chamber (AMC) reflector, very shallow Moho (approximately 3 km below the sea floor, unusually thin crustal thickness) is deduced from the refraction data obtained from the site around station 14, where the most dominant spreading is occurring to date in the NFB. The seafloor in this region is sediment free. This is interpreted to be simply because the crust is young and the volcanic material is directly exposed at the seafloor as a result of the recent volcanism. This is also confirmed from the velocity profiles obtained by refraction experiments. Although the station distribution of the refraction experiments is not dense enough to cover all along the axial region, the along-axis lateral variation of the velocity-depth profile of the crust is implied. In general, the feature of the crustal velocity structure in the axial domain deduced from seismic reflection and refraction experiments indicates that the central spreading/rifting system of the NFB is very similar to that of mid-ocean ridge crust rather than those of island- or back-arc type or the typical mature oceanic crust, which are observed in the NFB, outside of the central domain.","","article","","116","","","Crustal structure variation along the central rift/ridge axis in the North Fiji Basin: Implications from seismic reflection and refraction data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0025322794901716","0025-3227","1994","101-111","Marine Geology"

This study investigates losses of nutrients in runoff water (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)), metals (copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr)), and microbial indicators of pollution (total and faecal coliforms) arising from the land application of four types of treated biosolids and DCS to field micro-plots at three time intervals (24, 48, 360h) after application. Losses from biosolids-amended plots or DCS-amended plots followed a general trend of highest losses occurring during the first rainfall event and reduced losses in the subsequent events. However, with the exception of total and faecal coliforms and some metals (Ni, Cu), the greatest losses were from the DCS-amended plots. For example, average losses over the three rainfall events for dissolved reactive phosphorus and ammonium-nitrogen from DCS-amended plots were 5 and 11.2mgL−1, respectively, which were in excess of the losses from the biosolids plots. When compared with slurry treatments, for the parameters monitored biosolids generally do not pose a greater risk in terms of losses along the runoff pathway. This finding has important policy implications, as it shows that concern related to the reuse of biosolids as a soil fertiliser, mainly related to contaminant losses upon land application, may be unfounded.","","article","","541","","","Nutrient, metal and microbial loss in surface runoff following treated sludge and dairy cattle slurry application to an Irish grassland soil","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715307130","0048-9697","2016","218-229","Science of The Total Environment"

Particularly, DL methods have been successfully used to classify remotely sensed data collected by Earth Observation (EO) instruments. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a hot topic in remote sensing data analysis due to the vast amount of information comprised by this kind of images, which allows for a better characterization and exploitation of the Earth surface by combining rich spectral and spatial information. However, HSI poses major challenges for supervised classification methods due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited availability of training samples. These issues, together with the high intraclass variability (and interclass similarity) –often present in HSI data– may hamper the effectiveness of classifiers. In order to solve these limitations, several DL-based architectures have been recently developed, exhibiting great potential in HSI data interpretation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current-state-of-the-art in DL for HSI classification, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the most widely used classifiers in the literature. For each discussed method, we provide quantitative results using several well-known and widely used HSI scenes, thus providing an exhaustive comparison of the discussed techniques. The paper concludes with some remarks and hints about future challenges in the application of DL techniques to HSI classification.

Accurate and timely information on Ulva areal coverage and biomass is of critical importance for governmental responses, decision making, and field studies. Previous studies have shown that satellite remote sensing is the most effective method for this purpose, yet Ulva areal coverage has been estimated in different ways with significantly different results. The objective of this paper is to determine the lower and upper bounds (T0 and T1) of algae-containing pixels in Floating Algae Index images with an objective method that accurately estimates the Ulva areal coverage in individual images, and then converts coverage to biomass using a previously established conversion equation. First, a seawater background image, FAIsw, is constructed to determine T0, which varies for different algae patches. Then, T1 is determined from water tank and in situ measurements as well as radiative transfer simulations to account for different sensor configurations, solar/viewing geometry, and atmospheric conditions. Such determined T1 for MODIS 250-m resolution data is validated using concurrent and collocated 2-m resolution WorldView-2 data. Finally, Ulva areal coverage derived from MODIS data using this method are compared with those from the high-resolution data (OLI/Landsat, WFV/GaoFen-1), with a mean relative difference of 9.6%. Furthermore, an analysis of 17 same-day MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua image pairs shows that large viewing angles, atmospheric turbidity, and sunglint can lead to an underestimation of Ulva coverage of up to 45% under extreme conditions.","","article","","223","","","On the remote estimation of Ulva prolifera areal coverage and biomass","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425719300148","0034-4257","2019","194-207","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Samples were collected from three sites in summer (May 1997) and winter (January 1998) along a transect from an unvegetated Creek Bank through a vegetated Tidal Levee to the vegetated midmarsh with evident lateral heterogeneity caused by hydrologic regime, macrophytes and microbial and macrofaunal activities. A suite of trace metals (As, Ba, Cr, Co, Cu, Cd, Mo, Ni, Pb, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn and Zr) was analyzed to obtain their depth-distribution at the three sites. Spatially marked differences were observed, that were primarily related to hydraulic flushing of trace metals away from the sites in high-energy regimes, rapid downward mixing and reworking of sediment via bioturbation, and below-ground degradation and production of Spartina biomass. Although sulfate reduction and the formation of acid volatile sulfide and pyrite were dominant processes throughout the marsh, the trace metal scavenging role of sulfides was not apparent. However, possible sulfurization of organic matter, leading to enhanced trapping of trace metals with organic carbon, may have played an important role in sequestration of trace metals. No similarity was observed visually between the depth trends of trace metals and sediment properties (grain size, iron-oxyhydroxide content, acid volatile sulfides and pyrite content) that are known to play a major role in trace metal partitioning. Only organic carbon content closely followed the trace metal profiles at all the three sites. Minor variation in depth-integrated sediment trace metal content was observed seasonally at each of the three sites. Furthermore, the depth trend of profiles of individual trace metals also did not vary significantly over the seasons either.","","article","","72","","","Spatial and seasonal variations in depth profile of trace metals in saltmarsh sediments from Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771406005476","0272-7714","2007","675-689","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science"

Measurements were also made in the air above the eddy in order to estimate air–sea exchange rates for some components. The physical, biological and biogeochemical properties of the eddy resemble those of other eddies studied in this area, suggesting that the results we report may be applicable beyond the specific eddy studied. During a period of low wind speed at the start of the experiment, we are able to quantitatively describe and balance the nutrient and carbon budgets for the eddy. We also report concentrations of various trace gases in the region which are similar to those observed in other studies and we estimate exchange rates for several trace gases. We show that the importance of gas exchange over other loss terms varies with time and also varies for the different gases. We show that the various trace gases considered (CO2, dimethyl sulphide (DMS), N2O, CH4, non-methane-hydrocarbons, methyl bromide, methyl iodide and volatile selenium species) are all influenced by physical and biological processes, but the overall distribution and temporal variability of individual gases are different to one another. A storm disrupted the stratification in the eddy during the experiment, resulting in enhanced nutrient supply to surface waters, enhanced gas exchange rates and a change in plankton community, which we quantify, although overall productivity was little changed.

The relative “trade space” for U.S.-bound containerized shipments is delineated via reverse spatial interaction modeling. Reconfiguration and reverse calibration of the doubly constrained spatial interaction model is used to derive functional distances between origins and ports of export, as a means of estimating a Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ) for trade flows at the scale of the continent. Global and local statistics of spatial autocorrelation are then used to analyze the spatial pattern of trade impedance. With this approach, the analysis of containerized flows establishes the existence, extent, location, and spatial distribution of discrepancies in South American landside trade impedance. A large share of trade flows have trade impedance that is disproportionate to distance. Trade impedance at origins is spatially clustered for the total dataset and randomly distributed for commodity segments, and randomly distributed at destinations. Potential focus areas for high trade impedance are identified.","","article","","58","","","Spatial patterns of landside trade impedance in containerized South American exports","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692317300121","0966-6923","2017","272-285","Journal of Transport Geography"

Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services.","","article","","92","","","FrameSTEP: A framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417306796","0957-4174","2018","533-545","Expert Systems with Applications"

Highlighting in this study the spatial and temporal concordant clustering of deep-seated slope failures in the external Southwestern Alps, we discuss and review the possible causes for such wide-spread slope instabilities at both local and larger (Alpine) scale. High resolution field mapping coupled with electrical resistivity tomography first allows establishing an inventory of large landslides in the Southwestern Alps, determining their structural model, precising their depth limit (100–200 m) as well as the involved rock volumes (>107 m3). We show that they developed in the same geostructural context of thick mudstone layers overlain by faulted limestone and followed a block-spread model of deformation that could evolve in rock-collapse events. Cosmic ray exposure dating (CRE), using both 36Cl and 10Be in coexisting limestone and chert, respectively, has been carried out from the main scarps of six Deep Seated Landslides (DSL) and leads to landslide-failure CRE ages ranging from 3.7 to 4.7 ka. They highlighted: (i) mainly single and fast ruptures and (ii) a possible concomitant initiation with a main peak of activity between 3.3 and 5.1 ka, centered at ca 4.2 ka. Because this region was not affected by historical glaciations events, landslide triggering by glacial unloading can be excluded. The presented data combined with field observations preferentially suggest that these failures were climatically driven and were most likely controlled by high pressure changes in the karstic medium. In effect, the chronicle of failure-ages is concomitant to a well-known climatic pulse, the “4.2 ka” climate event characterized by intense hydrological perturbations associated to the heaviest rainfall period of the entire Holocene. Despite requiring further investigations and discussions, the dating of numerous events across the entire Alps during the middle Holocene period suggests a potential synchronous triggering of several large-scale gravitational-failures induced by the mid-Holocene climatic transition.","","article","","90","","","Mid-Holocene cluster of large-scale landslides revealed in the Southwestern Alps by 36Cl dating.

Fowler and Monica Nordberg","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-59453-2.00056-1","Inorganic tin compounds occur naturally in the Earth’s crust. In the environment, tin can be found in both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic tin compounds are released from natural and anthropogenic sources. The conversion of metallic tin forms to compounds that may be more soluble increases the risk of exposure and toxicity. Organotin compounds in the environment largely originate from anthropogenic activities. However, chemical and biochemical methylation reactions convert inorganic tin compounds into methyltin form. Biomethylation of alkyltins results in the accumulation of more toxic organotin compounds. Tin is not regarded an essential nutrient for humans. However, tin is considered an essential for the growth of rats, with a requirement for tin of between 1 and 2mg/kg in the diet. Elemental tin, inorganic tin compounds, and long-chain alkyltins are poorly absorbed when ingested, which accounts for their relatively low toxicity. The toxicity of organotin compounds depends on the length of alkyl chain, hydrophobicity, and other physicochemical properties. Hydrophobic organotins are toxic to a wide variety of organisms owing to their high solubility in cell membranes. The alkyl tins are more toxic than the aryl tins, whereas the toxicity of short-chain alkyltin compounds such as trimethyl- and triethyltin is higher than that of long-chain compounds: toxicity increases with number of alkyl groups. The excretory routes of tin compounds may vary depending of the type of compounds and the mode of exposure. Insoluble inorganic tin compounds are largely nontoxic. However, inhalation of tin dust results in its deposition in lungs and may cause “stannosis,” a benign pneumoconiosis. Some tin salts are irritating or can liberate toxic fumes during decomposition. Gastrointestinal absorption of soluble tin salts is only a few percent of the ingested dose. In chronic exposure, tin tends to accumulate in kidney, liver, and bones. Bones comprise a major site of deposition of tin after long-term exposure and intramuscular injection. The biological half-life of tin in bone is approximately 100 days. Exposure to high concentrations of inorganic tin may cause gastrointestinal illness, as well as liver and kidney problems. No noteworthy histopathological observations of nonneoplastic nature were reported in a long-term study. Short-chain alkyls are easily absorbed from gastrointestinal tract. Some alkyltin compounds, particularly tributyltin and triphenyltin, have high toxicity. Chronic exposure to butyltin compounds causes imposex, a pathological condition characterized by development of male sex characteristics in female gastropods. Toxicity of organotins in humans is most frequently reported as loss of memory and seizure, as well as other symptoms including death. Short-chain alkyltin, particularly the trialkyl derivatives, and aromatic tin compounds are neurotoxic. Hydrophobic trimethyltin and triethyltin compounds readily diffuse into richly lipophilic tissues such as brain and cause encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and severe seizures. Tetraalkyltins are enzymatically converted to the trisubstituted form and exert delayed but similar neurotoxic effects. Tributyltin compounds are less toxic than trimethyl- and triethyltins. They may be strongly irritating to the skin in humans. It was reported that shipyard workers exposed to tributyltin oxide developed severe dermatitis, difficulty in breathing, and flu-like symptoms. Trisubstituted organotin derivatives are implicated in hepatotoxicity, immunodeficiency, endocrine disruption, and both reproductive anomalies and infertility in laboratory animals. Monobutyltin and dibutyltin show genotoxicity, while mono- and dimethyltin are not genotoxic. Organotin compounds penetrate the cell membrane and interrupt oxidative phosphorylation, disturb calcium homeostasis, damage mitochondria, and induce apoptosis.","San Diego","incollection","Academic Press","","Handbook on the Toxicology of Metals (Fourth Edition)","978-0-444-59453-2","Chapter 56 - Tin","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444594532000561","","2015","1241-1285",""

The main sources and pathways of As pollution in this region include: (i) volcanism and geothermalism: (a) volcanic rocks, fluids (e.g., gases) and ash, including large-scale transport of the latter through different mechanisms, (b) geothermal fluids and their exploitation; (ii) natural lixiviation and accelerated mobilization from (mostly sulfidic) metal ore deposits by mining and related activities; (iii) coal deposits and their exploitation; (iv) hydrocarbon reservoirs and co-produced water during exploitation; (v) solute and sediment transport through rivers to the sea; (vi) atmospheric As (dust and aerosol); and (vii) As exposure through geophagy and involuntary ingestion. The two most important and well-recognized sources and mechanisms for As release into the Latin American population's environments are: (i) volcanism and geothermalism, and (ii) strongly accelerated As release from geogenic sources by mining and related activities. Several new analyses from As-endemic areas of Latin America emphasize that As-related mortality and morbidity continue to rise even after decadal efforts towards lowering As exposure. Several public health regulatory institutions have classified As and its compounds as carcinogenic chemicals, as As uptake can affect several organ systems, viz. dermal, gastrointestinal, peptic, neurological, respiratory, reproductive, following exposure. Accordingly, ingesting large amounts of As can damage the stomach, kidneys, liver, heart, and nervous system; and, in severe cases, may cause death. Moreover, breathing air with high As levels can cause lung damage, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Further, As compounds, being corrosive, can also cause skin lesions or damage eyes, and long-term exposure to As can lead to cancer development in several organs.","","article","","780","","","Seven potential sources of arsenic pollution in Latin America and their environmental and health impacts","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721013425","0048-9697","2021","146274","Science of The Total Environment"

This paper presents the coastal observatory in the Spanish Catalan coast and its contribution to a better understanding of processes that take place in this area. The XIOM network for oceanographic and coastal meteorological measurements (Xarxa d'Instrumentació Oceanogràfica I Meteorològica) is owned by the Catalan regional government. XIOM buoys collect wave height data at local receiving stations, which is then validated statistically, and the subsequent results are displayed on the website. Water level recordings are based on pressure measurements and atmospheric variables recorded with typical meteorological stations. At present, there is not a continuous measurement of currents or temperatures in the Catalan shelf-slope region, but several moorings have been deployed in the area. The coastal wind field is highly heterogeneous with main components from E, NW and S. This will have some implication for the coastal wind waves. Even with the relatively short fetch in the NW Mediterranean, the Catalan coast can be impacted by damaging waves during storms. At the Ebro delta the complex winds develop bimodal spectral wave features. In the central and north coast typical unimodal spectra are found. The most important variations in sea level in the Catalan coast are due to meteorological conditions and in some areas the resonant effect of bays and harbours. Storm surges may be of the order of 1 m, a magnitude much larger than tidal range. This sea level variation has a very important effect on storm risk and coastal flooding and it is a very important factor when modelling coastal dynamics in extreme events. The continental shelf slope dynamics are dominated by a quasi-permanent slope current. The mean current intensity is not very strong (~10 cm/s at 100 m depth) but it presents a seasonal intensification in winter where velocities can reach higher values. Over the shelf, little work has been previously done over long time series. The measurements obtained allowed the identification of the relative influence of winds, Ebro river outflow and open sea dynamics on the shelf dynamics. An oil spill drift forecasting system has also been developed in which measurements will be used for the short forecast of oil transport. The XIOM is still growing and in a short term period meteorological buoys with current meters will be deployed and scalar buoys will be replaced by directional ones.","","article","","77","","","The XIOM: 20 years of a regional coastal observatory in the Spanish Catalan coast","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796308002248","0924-7963","2009","237-260","Journal of Marine Systems"

In this research the spatio-temporal variations in the distribution patterns of foraminifera, ostracods and molluscs are analyzed in surficial sediments sampled in 2012/13 at six low-tide estuaries of the southeastern Mediterranean coast. Live assemblages are studied using multivariate statistical analyses to determine their ecological preferences and seasonal dynamics whereas the dead assemblages are used to establish a reference baseline for future paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The statistical analysis indicates that salinity, TOC and % carbonate are the main environmental factors explaining 60% of the cumulative variance and controlling the distribution pattern of the different brackish taxa encountered in these estuaries. The foraminifera Ammonia tepida and some miliolids (Quinqueloculina and Varidentella) inhabit most estuaries during summer when salinities of 13–18psu and temperatures of 26–34°C occur. At the Naaman stream the agglutinated species Birsteiniolla macrostoma and Trichohyalus aguayoi dominate the assemblage during autumn and winter, respectively when salinities of 3–7psu and temperature of 18–24°C prevail. High abundance of the monospecific assemblage of the ostracod Cyprideis torosa was encountered at the Tanninim year round in oligohaline water. The gastropod Heleobia phaeniciaca prefers living at the Naaman and Tanninim streams while Pyrgophorus sp., an invasive and low salinity species, continue colonizing more stream reaches along the Israeli coast. The dead assemblages are composed of high numbers of local and transported species. It includes post storm-surge sediments containing high numbers of inland fresh and brackish water species transported by the floods. Those are mixed with inner to mid-shelf benthic and planktonic foraminifera, ostracods and molluscs. Transportation of the marine organisms a few hundred of meters inland via the estuaries indicates that the coastal areas are prone to storm surge events that are preserved clearly on the coast. The present study demonstrates that the combined use of different multi-proxy faunal records enhances significantly the understanding of the dynamics of low-tide estuaries. This can be applied also to other low-tide estuaries worldwide and facilitate better management of these threatened environments. Additionally, it enables understanding of the post-mortem processes that control the transition from the living to the death assemblages and by that improve paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the lower reaches of low-tide estuaries.","","article","","108","","","Calcareous assemblages of the southeastern Mediterranean low-tide estuaries — Seasonal dynamics and paleo-environmental implications","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110115300551","1385-1101","2016","30-49","Journal of Sea Research"

Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.","","article","","173","","","Variability and change in the west Antarctic Peninsula marine system: Research priorities and opportunities","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661118300818","0079-6611","2019","208-237","Progress in Oceanography"

In the present review, especial attention is given to estuaries in South America (SA), where legislation, policies and actions to guarantee environmental quality remain ineffective. There, the majority of estuaries face uncontrolled occupation of its margins by urban and industrial centres, agriculture and aquaculture expansion, water extraction and flow control. The lack of basic sanitation and poor environmental management (including territories within Marine Protected Areas) often lead to hydrological alterations, high nutrient loads, and the presence and dynamics of pollutants (nutrient loads, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), metals and plastic debris) along the entire estuarine ecocline. Organic enrichment has increased dissolved oxygen consumption, with wide spatio-temporal variability along latitudes and estuarine gradients. The toxicity, biogeochemistry and availability of metals and POPs depend on the annual fluctuations of salinity, water renewal, dissolved oxygen levels, suspended particulate loads, sediment mobility, grain size and composition at the sink. Plastic debris from land sources are widespread in estuaries, where they continue to fragment into microplastics. River basins are the main contributors of plastics to estuaries, whose transportation and accumulation are subjected to interannual water flow variations. Although some systems seems to be in a better condition in relation to others around the world (e.g. Goiana and Negro estuaries), many others are among the most modified worldwide (e.g. Guanabara Bay and Estero Salado System). We propose that, estuarine conservation plans should consider year-round fluctuations of the ecocline and the resulting cycles of retention and flush of environmental signals and their influence on trophic webs over the whole extent of estuarine gradients.","","article","","651","","","Distribution, sources and consequences of nutrients, persistent organic pollutants, metals and microplastics in South American estuaries","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718337264","0048-9697","2019","1199-1218","Science of The Total Environment"

Ubiquitous cloud cover in summer inhibits the use of optical sensors for providing large-scale estimates of sea ice surface albedo. C-band (5.3 GHz) Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data from ENVISAT-ASAR is compared to coincident surface climatological albedo (α) estimates derived from high-resolution Quickbird VIS-NIR imagery in order to demonstrate the utility of high-resolution, dual-polarized (VV, HH) SAR for detecting variations in α of melt pond covered landfast first-year sea ice (FYI) adjacent to Hudson Bay. Variations in ice α are detected from SAR imagery using the co-polarization ratio (γ), shown to be significantly correlated (−0.81) with α when melt ponds are in liquid form. Results show the use of γ represents a substantial increase in correlation to α when compared to conventional like-polarized SAR backscattering coefficients.

In fact, observation of atmospheric composition variables has been an important activity of atmospheric research that has developed instrumental tools (advanced analytical techniques) and platforms (instrumented passenger aircrafts, ground-based in situ and remote sensing stations, earth observation satellite instruments) providing essential information on the composition of the atmosphere. The variability of the atmospheric system and the extreme complexity of the atmospheric cycles for short-lived gaseous and aerosol species have led to the development of complex models to interpret observations, test our theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry and predict future atmospheric composition. The validation of numerical models requires accurate information concerning the variability of atmospheric composition for targeted species via comparison with observations and measurements. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent advances in instrumentation and methodologies for measuring atmospheric composition changes from space, aircraft and the surface as well as recent improvements in laboratory techniques that permitted scientific advance in the field of atmospheric chemistry. Emphasis is given to the most promising and innovative technologies that will become operational in the near future to improve knowledge of atmospheric composition. Our current observation capacity, however, is not satisfactory to understand and predict future atmospheric composition changes, in relation to predicted climate warming. Based on the limitation of the current European observing system, we address the major gaps in a second part of the paper to explain why further developments in current observation strategies are still needed to strengthen and optimise an observing system not only capable of responding to the requirements of atmospheric services but also to newly open scientific questions.","","article","","43","","","Measuring atmospheric composition change","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231009007079","1352-2310","2009","5351-5414","Atmospheric Environment"

On the other hand, evolving information and communication technology offers ample opportunity for more reliable supply chain management practices. Event processing has established itself in many applications in logistics. Although the topic has enjoyed increasing popularity, there is no study taking stock of prior developments and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic literature review on the topic of event processing in supply chain management from 2005 until the present is undertaken. Extant literature is synthesized and analyzed from technological and supply chain management perspectives to inform scholars and practitioners of existing field developments. Additionally, to guide future scholarly endeavors, a research agenda is derived from promising topics raised in papers and unfulfilled practical requirements. We find that current solutions primarily focus on a limited number of supply chain core processes and a restricted number of supply chain actors. The majority of publications focused on time-temperature sensitive products. Additionally, the domination of road transportation can be observed, while other modes of transport are often ignored in solution implementations. Decision support in terms of object traceability within the supply chain is found in most articles. RFID, typically accompanied by the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, is the dominant enabling technology. Future research should focus on the topics of standardization, granularity, data sources, and cooperation. Moreover, holistic event processing supported by big data and machine learning techniques could create interfaces with other legacy business intelligence applications. Another promising area includes the exploration of new technologies, i.e. IoT, to enable new smart solutions.","","article","","105","","","Event processing in supply chain management – The status quo and research outlook","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361518303166","0166-3615","2019","229-249","Computers in Industry"

We found that the prehistoric grass-dominated grassland, likely maintained by frequent anthropogenic fire, extended to the landscape scale, well beyond the confines of Quiroste Valley. In a novel attempt to use the proportion of burned phytoliths in the soil to quantitatively estimate prehistoric fire frequency at nearby McCabe Canyon in Pinnacles National Park, we tested three approaches described in the phytolith literature to identify individual burned soil phytoliths and found each approach had serious problems. The first approach, identifying visually darkened phytoliths, was accurate when performed on freshly burned leaf material, but highly problematic when applied to weathered phytoliths extracted from a typical grassland soil. The second approach, using changes in the refractive index caused by heating of phytoliths, was not effective within the temperature range typical of grassland fires, and was prone to rehydration effects in the soil environment. The third approach, using Raman spectroscopy to identify phytoliths with spectral changes caused by heating of carbon occluded in phytoliths, was not able to distinguish heated, non-darkened phytoliths, but was able to distinguish visually darkened phytoliths that had been subjected to an open flame. Each approach was rejected as inadequate; we were unable to use phytoliths to quantitatively estimate prehistoric fire frequency. Additional research quantifying the effects of weathering on soil phytolith coloration and opacity may make the visual approach viable.","","article","","434","","","Testing phytolith analysis approaches to estimate the prehistoric anthropogenic burning regime on the central California coast","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618215010538","1040-6182","2017","78-90","Quaternary International"

The following environmental components were studied at mercury mining sites:–local topography;–plant species composition and its biogeochemical characteristics;–biological cycle of chemical elements;–properties of soils (primarily, geochemical) at mines and surrounding areas. The mercury mining sites studied are situated in various landscape-geochemical and climatic conditions, in medium-altitude mountainous forest landscapes of Caucasus. Two mines differ in temperature conditions and the amount of precipitation, although the straight-line distance between them is less than 100km.

These variations may be of climatic or anthropic origin. Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are known both to provide a good description of fire calendar and on a continental scale, a good indicator of locations of intense fire activity. In fact, the GAC data, available on a daily basis back to July 1981, is the only source of information actually available to determine burning patterns both on a continental scale and over long periods of time. This study presents the spatio-temporal distribution of vegetation fire in Central Africa, as derived from GAC imagery, over the four 1984/85 to 1987/88 dry seasons of the Northern Hemisphere (November to February periods). The analysis of the mean fire distribution patterns over the four dry seasons, as defined by vegetation cover and pluviometric conditions, shows a north to south gradient of fire activity in the savannah domain: This gradient of fire activity has been previously related to the annual pluviometric calendar and the amount of rainfall. The strong interannual variability in fire activity observed for this four-years-period could not, however, be explained by the monthly pluviometric patterns. The observed fire gradient therefore seems to result from additional meteorological or anthropic parameters. The methodology used in this study demonstrates the potential of GAC data for fire monitoring at a subcontinental scale. Current work is extending the area of interest to the entire African continent using the 10-yr-period of GAC imagery.","","article","","39","","","Remote sensing of bush fire dynamics in Central Africa from 1984 to 1988: analysis in relation to regional vegetation and pluviometric patterns","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016980959500011F","0169-8095","1995","179-200","Atmospheric Research"

Two forms of corruption costs are investigated in the empirical section: (1) distorting spending structure and project design, and (2) inflating prices. Findings indicate that corruption steers infrastructure spending towards high value as opposed to small value investment projects. It also inflates prices by 30–35% on average with largest excesses in high corruption risk regions. Contrary to perceptions, corruption risks in infrastructure are decoupled to a considerable extent from the national corruption environment.

However, few prototypes are easy to use and accessible for decision-makers to evaluate and manage risks locally. DESYCO is a GIS based decision support system specifically designed to better understand the risks that climate change poses at the regional/subnational scale (e.g. the effect of sea level rise and coastal erosion on human assets and ecosystems) and set the context of strategic adaptation planning within Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It implements a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowing the spatial assessment of multiple climate change impacts in coastal areas and the ranking of key elements at risk (beaches, wetlands, protected areas, urban and agricultural areas). The core of the system is a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model used to operationalize the steps of the RRA (hazard, exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage assessment) by integrating a blend of information from climate scenarios (global/regional climate projections and hydrodynamic/hydrological simulations) and from non-climate vulnerability factors (physical, environmental and socio-economic features of the analysed system). User-friendly interfaces simplify the interaction with the system, providing guidance for risk mapping, results communication and understanding. DESYCO was applied to low-lying coastal plains and islands (the North Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Gabes and the Republic of Mauritius), river basins and groundwater systems (Upper Plain of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche Region).

The performance of these services depends on the available bandwidth of the underlying network, the physical proximity of the cloud server and the end devices, the volume of data, the computational capacity of the server, and, importantly, the mobility of the devices hosting the applications. Edge computing promises to provide better performance by bringing services (e.g., a video streaming service) from the cloud to servers near the user. It also enables partial or full offloading of the computation (tasks) and storage functionalities from the User Equipment (UE) to the edge of the network. This saves power and benefits from relatively more powerful devices at the edge. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which supports wireless and wired access technologies, has gained significant research interest. When UEs move, services must continue to operate, tasks may need to be offloaded again, and states related to tasks and services may need to be migrated. In this paper, we focus on four functional components (task/service offloading, resource allocation, content/task caching, and service/task migration) of MEC. We survey the challenges to these and their solutions in the context of UE mobility. Mobility creates challenges during offloading resource-intensive tasks as the user may move while the task is being offloaded. Some of the other challenges are how to jointly allocate computing and communication resources, minimize service down time during migration, and share the backhaul network if the same MEC host must continue to be used. Some key research areas include intelligent task offloading and service migration algorithms, exploiting group mobility to improve task migration time, studying the interplay of MEC parameters such as capabilities of the target MEC host, etc. In addition, predicting the mobile trajectory through intelligent methods and implementations with datasets from real-world scenarios are required. We compare this paper on 11 parameters (service migration, task offloading, resource allocation, content caching, mobility, use cases, architecture, computing paradigm, mobility model, system model, virtualization/Software Defined Networks) with 31 other survey papers from 2018 to April 2022 in MEC and related domains. We discuss the Edge Computing paradigm, the system architecture and model descriptions, and use cases.

Some of these newly recognized paleosols have proven controversial, so this paper reviews 20 distinct tests to determine whether a particular Ediacaran bed could be a paleosol, or not. One problem has been that Ediacaran paleosols are not precisely like modern soils because they lack root traces, a diagnostic feature of Silurian and geologically younger paleosols. The principal problem for recognition of some Ediacaran paleosols is the occurrence in them of megafossils assumed to have been marine, although most of these fossils remain problematic for both biological and ecological affinities. Not all the tests discussed here are diagnostic of paleosols, some are ranked permissive or persuasive. Permissive conditions for paleosols include ripple marks, hummocky bedding, pyritic limestones, acritarchs or thalloid fossils, low strontium isotopic ratios, high δ26Mg ratios, and red color. Persuasive tests include loessites, tsunamites, desert playa minerals, low boron content, high δ10B isotopic ratios, high carbon/sulfur ratios, and very low total/reactive iron ratios. Diagnostic tests include matrix-supported lapilli or crystal tuff parent materials, ice wedges and other cryoturbation, sepic birefringence fabrics, evaporitic sand crystals, and negative geochemical strain and mass transfer, and highly correlated δ13C and δ18O. Like other geological periods, the Ediacaran is known from a variety of marine and non-marine paleoenvironments","","article","","36","","","Field and laboratory tests for recognition of Ediacaran paleosols","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X16300697","1342-937X","2016","107-123","Gondwana Research"

In order to improve on the original “meteorological bucket” method of sampling, we developed a network of merchant ships among those operating regular routes through the tropical Pacific, and equipped them with thermo-salinographs. Accurate positioning of the ships was obtained using a satellite positioning system. High frequency sampling (every 15 s) and recording of the median values for every 5 min resulted in quite precise monitoring of the SST and SSS, and in a description of the salinity fronts along the routes followed by the ships. Using this equipment, we were able to detect the influence of local rainfall on salinity and temperature and the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. The accuracy of salinity measurements (0.02) was better than that of the old sampling technique by one order of magnitude. Temperature measurement by the thermo-salinograph was very stable but yielded results that are 0.2–0.3°C higher than sea surface temperature. To ensure reliability of data, the equipment was carefully checked every time the ships called at Noumea (i.e. every 2–3 months), and re-calibration every year or two is essential.","","article","","43","","","A merchant ship thermo-salinograph network in the Pacific Ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063796000842","0967-0637","1996","1833-1855","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

Satellite data allowed the mapping of cyanobacteria surface accumulations, so-called “scums”, and of chlorophyll-a concentration. The 34-year time series shows a tendency towards later occurrence (October–November) of the cyanobacteria scum presence, whereas the period of its onset (June–July) remains relatively constant. The periods when scums are present, “hot moments”, have been consistently increasing in duration since 2008. The differences in the starting, ending and annual duration of cyanobacteria blooms have been significantly altered by hydro-meteorological conditions (river discharge, water temperature, and wind conditions) and their year-round patterns. The most important environmental factors that determined the temporal changes of the scum presence and area were the standing stock of cyanobacteria and the ambient wind conditions. The “hotspots”, the areas where the blooms most likely occur, were distributed in the south-southwestern and central parts of the lagoon. The least affected areas were the northern part, which is connected to the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, and the Nemunas River delta region. The longstanding, well-established spatial patterns of cyanobacteria blooms were linked to hydrodynamic features, namely water renewal time and current patterns, and to potential nutrient sources that included muddy sediments and the locations of colonies of piscivorous birds. Our findings confirmed that the annual and seasonal variations of cyanobacteria blooms and their regulation are a complex issue due to interactions between multiple factors over spatially and temporally broad scales. Despite great progress in the prevention and control of eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, the lagoon is still considered to be in a poor ecological status. This work provides a new and missing understanding on the spatial and temporal extent of cyanobacteria blooms and the factors that govern them. Such an understanding can help in planning management strategies, forecasting the magnitude and severity of blooms under changing nutrient loads and potential climate scenarios.","","article","","769","","","Hot moments and hotspots of cyanobacteria hyperblooms in the Curonian Lagoon (SE Baltic Sea) revealed via remote sensing-based retrospective analysis","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721001194","0048-9697","2021","145053","Science of The Total Environment"

A considerable diversity of glacial sediments and landforms results from a phase of glaciation, these products bearing variable compositional relationships to the local bedrock, and thus have varying usefulness in geochemical exploration. A classification of glacial sediments and landforms is described, with emphasis being placed on the provenance of the material composing the different types. The nature and extent of the Wisconsin glaciation in Canada is summarized, together with a review of the distribution of glacial sediments and landforms. Variations in the nature of the glaciation and the distribution of different glacial sediments and landforms have contributed to the situation that the applicability of geochemical exploration techniques varies across Canada. The nature of metal dispersion in glacial sediments resulting directly from glacial activity is discussed, particular reference being given to those features that have proved effective in geochemical exploration. The role of dispersion patterns in glacial sediments and landforms is discussed with regard to varying scales of geochemical exploration programs. Variations in the distribution of glacial sediments and the nature of associated dispersion patterns, both on the regional and local scales, make a consideration of the glacial geology an essential feature for the implementation of appropriate geochemical exploration procedures.","","article","","2","","","Glacial geology as a key to geochemical exploration in areas of glacial overburden with particular reference to Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375674273900125","0375-6742","1973","133-170","Journal of Geochemical Exploration"

The behaviour of PAN in the atmosphere has been studied at Harwell, a rural site in south-east England, using a sensitive technique with a detection limit of <30 ppt(v). Even during winter months, daytime levels of PAN above the detection limit were always present, demonstrating the ubiquity of this molecule in the atmosphere. Results for the periods November 1974-October 1975 and January 1980-June 1981 show the existence of a pronounced seasonal variation. Maximum levels were observed during summer months, and minimum values during winter. There is a large difference between these maxima and minima, in contrast to typical patterns for ozone, and it is suggested that PAN is a better indicator of overall chemical reactivity in the lower atmosphere. Simultaneous measurement of CFCl3, was found to be a good indicator of air mass quality and anthropogenic influence; increased levels of this tracer were always associated with elevated PAN concentrations. Unexpectedly high levels of PAN during two episodes in February 1981 showed the possibility of significant photochemical activity during winter months. Back-trajectory analysis for these periods, indicated the influence of mainland European emissions and subsequent transport of photochemically-aged air masses. Similar observations of high PAN made during February 1975 suggest that the occurrence of late-winter photochemical episodes may not be uncommon.","","incollection","Pergamon","","CACGP Symposium on Tropospheric Chemistry with Emphasis on Sulphur and Nitrogen Cycles and the Chemistry of Clouds and Precipitation","978-0-08-031448-8","ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS OF PEROXYACETYLNITRATE (PAN) IN RURAL, SOUTH-EAST ENGLAND: SEASONAL VARIATIONS WINTER PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080314488500458","","1984","2691-2702",""

Aerial photographs, SAR data from RADARSAT-2 satellite, field work, a digital elevation model and GIS spatial analysis have been used to identify, map and study the existing drainage basins. A series of morphometric parameters have been studied in 30 selected basins in order to characterize their shape as well as the drainage network. Results in morphometric parameters reveal elongation trends in the shape of basins and a limited hierarchical network, common of a youthful stage of landscape evolution models. Several morphometric indexes (hypsometric integral, hypsometric curves, SL index, transverse topographical drainage basin asymmetry-T-Factor) have been used to study possible controls on drainage development. Results have been discussed in relation to relief and drainage evolution linked to the spatial distribution of lithological units and structural framework. T-Factor shows an apparently disorganized pattern and absence of tectonic influence. However, there are local values of second order basin asymmetry directions and magnitudes, which could reflect a succession of master rills through time, related to the changes in water supply during the deglaciation history of Byers Peninsula. Hypsometric values and curves of basins are also mainly related to a young stage of landscape evolution. Analysis of hypsometric integrals together with T-Factor index has allowed us to establish a possible deglaciation model on Byers Peninsula, which successfully explains the results. Areas of different landscape evolution stage are linked in space and support the hypothesis of local glacial centers during the ice cover retreat process. SL index results do not show the same pattern in results, which could be due to differences between incision and lateral shifting ratios. Quantitative geomorphic analysis indicates that during the deglaciation of Byers Peninsula, at least three areas acted as local glacial centers (NW, central and Rotch Dome area). Changes in index results clearly show a different behavior between two areas; distal areas and proximal areas close to the glacial centers. Morphometric indexes have demonstrated their being useful tools to provide information on the glacial history in recently deglaciated Antarctic areas.","","article","","225","","","Insights into deglaciation of the largest ice-free area in the South Shetland Islands (Antarctica) from quantitative analysis of the drainage system","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X14001627","0169-555X","2014","4-24","Geomorphology"

Here, we show results of a controlled CO2 release experiment at the Sleipner CO2 storage site and numerical simulations that evaluate the detectability and environmental consequences of a well leaking CO2 into the Central North Sea (CNS). Our field measurements and numerical results demonstrate that the detectability and impact of a leakage of <55 t yr−1 of CO2 would be limited to bottom waters and a small area around the leak, due to rapid CO2 bubble dissolution in seawater within the lower 2 m of the water column and quick dispersion of the dissolved CO2 plume by strong tidal currents. As such, the consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are found to be insignificant in terms of storage performance. Only prolonged leakage along numerous wells might compromise long-term CO2 storage and may adversely affect the local marine ecosystem. Since many abandoned wells leak natural gas into the marine environment, hydrocarbon provinces with a high density of wells may not always be the most suitable areas for CO2 storage.","","article","","84","","","Footprint and detectability of a well leaking CO2 in the Central North Sea: Implications from a field experiment and numerical modelling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583618304857","1750-5836","2019","190-203","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

The country is also home to over 20 anopheline vectors of malaria which transmit all four of the species of Plasmodium that routinely infect humans. A complex mosaic of risk of infection across this 5000-km-long archipelago of thousands of islands and distinctive habitats seriously challenges efforts to control malaria. Social, economic and political dimensions contribute to these complexities. This chapter examines malaria and its control in Indonesia, from the earliest efforts by malariologists of the colonial Netherlands East Indies, through the Global Malaria Eradication Campaign of the 1950s, the tumult following the coup d'état of 1965, the global resurgence of malaria through the 1980s and 1990s and finally through to the decentralization of government authority following the fall of the authoritarian Soeharto regime in 1998. We detail important methods of control and their impact in the context of the political systems that supported them. We examine prospects for malaria control in contemporary decentralized and democratized Indonesia with multidrug-resistant malaria and greatly diminished capacities for integrated malaria control management programs.","","incollection","Academic Press","74","","","Chapter 2 - Malaria Distribution, Prevalence, Drug Resistance and Control in Indonesia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123858979000021","0065-308X","2011","41-175",""

However, the main unanswered questions about this foreseen transformation are its depth, breadth and timelines. To answer them, not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even ignore what various technologies in present-day AI are capable of. Many so-called breakthroughs in AI are associated with highly-cited research papers or good performance in some particular benchmarks. However, research breakthroughs do not directly translate into a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. In this paper, we present a novel exemplar-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (representing their depth in maturity and availability). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI, and identify several categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We then introduce a generality dimension, which represents increasing layers of breadth of the technology. These two dimensions lead to the new readiness-vs-generality charts, which show that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality technologies, focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while high TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields, and show their readiness-vs-generality charts, serving as exemplars. Finally, we show how the timelines of several AI technology exemplars at different generality layers can help forecast some short-term and mid-term trends for AI.","","article","","58","","","Futures of artificial intelligence through technology readiness levels","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585320301842","0736-5853","2021","101525","Telematics and Informatics"

Two groups of species could be distinguished. Songbirds (of many different species) passed northeast in large numbers over the mainland of New England; waterbirds (ducks, geese and gulls) passed east-northeast in smaller numbers over the Gulf of Maine. The waterbirds began to migrate 2 to 3 hr before sunset, the songbirds some 34 hr after sunset. Both movements continued in substantial numbers throughout the night, but shifts in the mean orientation led to smaller counts around midnight. Tests for bias in measuring the density of migration were negative. The main source of random errors was spatial variation in the density of birds before take-off. Measurements of the density of migration each evening were compared with measurements of nineteen weather variables in the area of take-off. Reasonably good fits to a multiple linear regression model were obtained if a nonlinear transformation (e.g. the 10th root) of the migration density was used as dependent variable. Migration density was significantly correlated with high and rising temperature, low and falling pressure, low but rising humidity, and the onshore (southeast) component of the wind velocity. Migration of songbirds was slightly suppressed by rain, but no other weather variable was significant. Migration was correlated both with the weather at the time of takeoff, and with the changes in weather during the previous 24 hr; at least in the case of the waterbirds, the changes were more important. At least for the songbirds, migration tended to be sparsest in the few days before full moon, but not during periods of cloudy weather. The density of migration was positively correlated with that on the previous night, largely due to auto-correlation in the weather variables. Migration of waterbirds tended to be sparser than expected on the second and third nights after a large departure, but denser than expected after 4 or more nights of delay. No such tendencies were found in the songbirds; after a night of migration songbirds tended to fly again on the next night. The relation between migration and weather was non-linear at both ends of the scale. Migration was usually suppressed in cold rains and reversed in cold northwest airstreams. It occurred strongly in the west-central part of a high pressure cell but tended to decline after the arrival of humid tropical air. Only minor differences were found between the behaviour of waterbirds and songbirds. Few precise conclusions can be drawn about the behaviour of individual birds. Multivariate statistics on uncontrolled variables permit inferences only of association, not of cause-and-effect. Errors are possible if important variables are omitted, or wrongly scaled. Migration was significantly correlated with high temperatures, high clouds and lack of rain at the birds' destination on the following day, but not with cloud cover and only weakly with wind direction. A computer experiment showed that the observed behaviour was very close to the optimum for predicting these variables at the destination. The behaviour is probably adapted to avoid rain, fog and cold air on arrival at the destination. These results differ considerably from those reported previously, but do not necessarily conflict with them. The main difference is the more elaborate statistical model used in this paper. Experimental studies of Zugunruhe are reviewed briefly. Most or all experimental studies have demonstrated only long-term effects of weather variables on Zugunruhe; confining birds in experimental situations may upset a system of checks and balances between external variables required for the expression of short-term effects of weather on migration.","","article","","16","","","Short-term effects of weather on bird migration: A field study using multivariate statistics","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347268900468","0003-3472","1968","496-530","Animal Behaviour"
"FRUDDIMAN1981145","William ","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(81)90097-3","The last deglacial warming of the high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean (40–65°) occurred in three discrete steps: in the southeast and central regions at 13 000 B.P.; in the central and northern sectors at 10 000 B.P.; and in the western (Labrador Sea) sector between 9000 and 6000 B.P. This regionally time-transgressive sequence was punctuated by a major cooling and polar front readvance from 11 000 to 1000 B.P.; this briefly returned most of the high-latitude North Atlantic to almost full-glacial temperatures. Carbonate productivity levels reached minimum values from 16 000 B.P. to 13 000 B.P. and then gradually rose, reaching maximum values in the Holocene at about 6000 B.P. We interpret these changes in carbonate productivity as indicating a major influx of products of glacial wastage (meltwater and icebergs) from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P., with considerably reduced influx after 13 000 B.P. Combined with evidence for meltwater influx to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River, this suggests that the bulk of volumetric deglaciation in the Northern Hemisphere occurred considerably earlier than the main areal retreat of ice-sheet limits. This implies that the still-extensive ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere were relatively thin by 13 000 B.P. Because there is no palynologic evidence of unusual atmospheric warming on the southern margins of the ice sheets before 13 000 B.P., we infer that this early phase of rapid ice disintegration occurred largely by iceberg calving and marine downdraw. We also infer that from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P. low winter insolation combined with a low-salinity meltwater layer to form sea ice south to 50°N; after that date, the winter sea-ice cover diminished significantly. We infer from this that the critical flux of winter moisture to the ice sheets was largely cut off from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P. and still significantly suppressed after 13 000 B.P. Moisture starvation thus hastened the disintegration of Northern Hemisphere ice masses. The brief but strong oceanic cooling roughly coincident with the European Younger Dryas (11 000 to 10 000 B.P.) appears to mark a major influx of tabular icebergs from a disintegrating Arctic ice shelf, perhaps enhanced by external forcing at higher frequencies (2500 yr).","","article","","35","","","The North Atlantic Ocean during the last deglaciation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031018281900973","0031-0182","1981","145-214","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

Here we advance the concept of emergent facilitation, whereby emergent trees benefit co-occurring species. Trees reorganize foliage within crowns to optimize available light and, if long-lived, can reiterate after crown damage to become emergent. The height, depth, and spacing of emergent trees in turn allows for abundant light to pass through the canopy, leading to light-use complementarity as well as elevated biomass, leaf area, and species diversity of the forest as a whole. We chose Sequoia sempervirens to develop this concept and installed eleven 1-ha plots in old-growth forests spanning nearly six degrees of latitude in California. Each plot was based off a 316-m-long centerline where biomass and leaf area of all vegetation were quantified. We employed hierarchical measurements and stratified random sampling spanning the full size range of individuals to generate 180 equations for determining biomass and leaf area of all dominant plant species in these forests. Biomass (5190Mgha−1), leaf area (LAI=19.4), and aboveground carbon (2600Mgha−1) are global maxima, occurring in plots with the highest proportion of emergent trees. Decay-resistant Sequoia heartwood contributes the bulk of this mass, ranging from 61.5 to 76.7% of plot totals. Heartwood is a key contributor to the development of trees with emergent crowns, since its durability enables trees to recover leaf area and to re-grow crowns after damage so that they can continue expanding for millennia. By distributing leaf area among fewer trees with deeper crowns, Sequoia maintains very high leaf area itself (LAI up to 14.5) while simultaneously allowing other species to flourish underneath (non-Sequoia LAI up to 8.0). Because Sequoia is not replaced by other species, aboveground biomass, leaf area, and carbon content of these forests are essentially asymptotic over time.","","article","","375","","","Emergent crowns and light-use complementarity lead to global maximum biomass and leaf area in Sequoia sempervirens forests","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112716302584","0378-1127","2016","279-308","Forest Ecology and Management"

Therefore, the elemental composition of atmospheric aerosols was investigated for nine sites in the Recife conurbation and a fairly remote site in the area. Total aerosol samples were collected on cellulose filters for analysis by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and cascade impactors were used to collect the aerosols as a function of particle size for subsequent analysis by proton-induced X-ray emission. Local soil aliquots were also analysed. About eighteen elements were quantified in all cases. The average total atmospheric concentrations appeared to be well above natural levels but usually lower than, or comparable with, those of North American and European cities. Dispersal of sea spray and of local soil (often contaminated with, for example, Cu, Zn and Pb from industrial sources) contributes predominantly to the total atmospheric load in Recife. However, the particle size fraction results also indicated strong excesses in the small particle mode for S, K, V, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br and Pb, mainly in the downtown area. Again, the corresponding enrichment factors were only moderate in comparison with other published urban data.","","article","","4","","","Elemental constituents of atmospheric aerosols in recife, North-East Brazil","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0143148X82900258","0143-148X","1982","143-163","Environmental Pollution Series B, Chemical and Physical"

From (Trav. Lab. Géol. Fac. Sci. 26 (1947) 17), until (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609), the base of the Albian stage has been taken at the first appearance of the ammonite Leymeriella (Proleymeriella) schrammeni, a species known only from a limited area of northwest Germany. The early succession of Leymeriella and its relationship with ammonite taxa from the underlying Hypacanthoplites jacobi ammonite Zone can only be determined in the northwest German sections, all of which are ephemeral clay pits. Thus, the definition of the base of the Albian on these criteria cannot be used in a global context. The positioning of the boundary has been the subject of intense discussion in the last years. After the second International Symposium on Cretaceous Stage Boundaries in 1995 (Bull. Inst. R. Sci. Nat. Belgique, Sci. Terre 66 (1996) 45). (Cret. Res. 20 (1999) 609) lowered the boundary to the base of his Hypacanthoplites rubricosus ammonite Subzone without describing a global boundary stratotype section. (Cret. Res. 21 (2000) 591) raised the boundary to the alleged first occurrence (FO) of Leymeriella tardefurcata in a permanent section, but neither proposals can be accepted globally (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1). (Cret. Res. 22 (2001) 677) supported by (Cret. Res. 23 (2002) 1), suggested a radical solution by raising the boundary to the base of the geographically widespread Lyelliceras lyelli ammonite Subzone, currently the base of the Middle Albian. In order to document accurately the classical northwest German succession of the Aptian/Albian boundary, a detailed multidisciplinary study has been made of a new section at Vöhrum (clay pit no. 4) with respect to its content of calcareous nannofossils, benthic foraminifera, planktonic foraminifera, ostracods, ammonites, as well as its clay mineralogy, gamma ray signature and tuff geochemistry. The ammonite succession, in particular the Callizoniceras–Leymeriella lineage, is discussed in detail. The FO of Leymeriella (Proleymeriella) schrammeni anterior, 0.65m below a tuff horizon near the base of the section is taken as the Aptian/Albian boundary in the classical German sense. Sections in France are discussed and the Leymeriella lineage is reviewed.","","article","","24","","","The Vöhrum section (northwest Germany) and the Aptian/Albian boundary","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195667103000430","0195-6671","2003","203-252","Cretaceous Research"

Burke","","","","Green water, Mesocosm, Fish, Shrimp, Larviculture","","1","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.06.018","Since 1989, researchers with the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) in Queensland, Australia, have successfully used controlled low-water exchange green-water cultures to rear the larvae of estuarine fishes and crustaceans through to metamorphosis. High survivals and excellent fry condition have been achieved for several commercially important endemic species produced for various projects. They include barramundi or sea bass, Lates calcarifer, Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata, dusky flathead, Platycephalus fuscus, sand whiting, Sillago ciliata, red sea bream or snapper, Pagrus auratus, banana prawn, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, and others. The consistent success of our standardised and relatively simple approach at different localities has led to it being incorporated into general fingerling production practices at several establishments in Australia. Although post-metamorphosis rearing methods have differed for each species investigated, due to various biological and behavioural traits and project requirements, these larval rearing methods have been successful with few species-specific modifications. Initially modelled on the Taiwanese approach to rearing Penaeids in aerated low-water exchange cultures, the approach similarly appears to rely on a beneficial assemblage of micro-organisms. Conceptually, these micro-organisms may include a mixture of the air-borne primary invaders of pure phytoplankton cultures when exposed to outdoor conditions. Whilst this would vary with different sites, our experiences with these methods have consistently been favourable. Mass microalgal cultures with eco-physiological youth are used to regularly augment larval fish cultures so that rearing conditions simulate an exponential growth-phase microalgal bloom. Moderate to heavy aeration prevents settlement of particulate matter and encourages aerobic bacterial decomposition of wastes. The green-water larval rearing approach described herein has demonstrated high practical utility in research and commercial applications, and has greatly simplified marine finfish hatchery operations whilst generally lifting production capacities for metamorphosed fry in Australia.

It turns out that the volume of gas available increases exponentially as one moves from conventional gas to Coalbed methane, then to tight sand and shale gas, and then finally to gas hydrate deposits. For instance, gas hydrate volume is hundreds of times greater in methane volume than other sources of methane. At the same time, the quality as well as environmental integrity is also higher with more abundant gas resources. In this chapter, the most important features of gas with geological background are presented. This is followed with the process that is involved in forming natural gas through various physicochemical processes. At the end, it is demonstrated that unconventional gas is also the “cleanest” form of energy available today.

If true, the tropical ocean at those times must have been distinctly colder than at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when northern hemisphere ice sheets did not extend below 38° latitude. Low-latitude ocean temperatures derived from oxygen isotopes of brachiopod shells test this hypothesis by comparing the temperature regime for Paleozoic and early Mesozoic low-latitude settings to the tropical temperature regime of the modern interstadial ocean, and to mean temperatures estimated for the tropical ocean at LGM. A running mean of pH-adjusted brachiopod habitat temperatures (BHTs) shows that Paleozoic low-latitude oceans were, on average, cool to cold relative to the modern interstadial tropical ocean. At times during Pennsylvanian, Serpukhovian, Tournaisian and Ordovician–Silurian glaciations, these tropical seas were indeed significantly colder on average than at the LGM. Ice-sheets within tropical latitudes can be reasonably predicted at those times. Abundant and diverse Paleozoic brachiopod communities reflect these cool tropical oceans, consistent with modern brachiopod ecological preference for colder waters. Amplified Paleozoic temperature oscillations suggest recurring global warming events which episodically drove these cold tropical oceans to temperatures significantly higher than the warmest modern tropical ocean.","","article","","317-318","","","Low-latitude Ordovician to Triassic brachiopod habitat temperatures (BHTs) determined from δ18O[brachiopod calcite]: A cold hard look at ice-house tropical oceans","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018212000168","0031-0182","2012","134-152","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

Routine measurements taken by countries participating in EMEP are so far available from CCC EMEP for hour of these years. This paper aims at demonstrating the usefulness of having access to simultaneous sets of data, such as measurements and model-calculated quantities for which one can vary the determining parameters. By comparing the data sets with emissions used in the calculations, one can identify both important model shortcomings as well as probable errors in measurements and emissions. Furthermore, trends in manual deposition and concentration levels can be investigated by controlling the meteorological input in order to filter out the effect of meteoroligical variability. In general, errors in modelled concentrations can only be identified with confidence if a statistically sufficient number of stations agree. This is the case for NO2 in air for which the model seems to underestimate systematically the measured concentrations, and for sulphate and nitrate in precipitation for which the model gives persistently lower concentrations than measured over peripheral areas in Europe. A majority of the “outliers” in the scatter plots comparing measurements and calculations are seen to be connected with clear misfits between emission data and measured values. Furthermore, at a few sites measurements show much larger variations from year to year than anticipated. The trend experiments emphasize the importance of meteorological variability as compared to emission changes. Even if the impacts of emission trends can be larger than those of meteorological variations at some sites, the complex spatial pattern caused by the latter completely masks the former. Measurements, being influenced by changes in both conditions, are thus of limited value for a year-to-year monitoring of emission reduction effects. Keeping the meteorology the same from year to year in the model calculations, reveals that calculated air concentrations and depositions correspond to the reported emissions. Trends in measurements and calculations generally agree well, except that for sulphur in air 1989 measured concentrations are smaller than calculated. This is believed to be a consequence of too high emission numbers for SO2 in 1989. The conclusions that can be drawn from this study are direct consequences of the distribution of measurement sites in Europe as part of EMEP. This distribution favours central European areas north of the Alps. The statistical confidence and representativity of the results would be much improved by a more evenly distributed measurement network.","","article","","27","","","Modelled and measured transboundary acidifying pollution in Europe— verification and trends","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096016869390008M","0960-1686","1993","889-920","Atmospheric Environment.

Research needs are emphasized from a systems perspective of global environmental change. Although fundamental quantitative knowledge is lacking, some qualitative linkages between source strengths, residence times, removal processes and the biosphere can be identified. It turns out that not only are the respective areas as such challenged by new problems, superimposed on the fairly well established conventional ones, but these areas also face mutually operating sets of feedbacks between residence times and sink/source characteristics of ecological systems subject to stress. To evaluate the sensitivity of these feedback loops, and to assess whether they are negative (stabilizing interactions) or positive (destabilizing) are important and potentially urgent tasks. Such studies should focus on a common goal, such as developing empirical and theoretical understanding of aerosol resuspension, transport and deposition for application in large-scale circulation models. A basic link in such advancements is that structural change of vegetated surfaces of the biosphere caused by deposition itself, and by changing land-use and climate, be understood and assessed.","","article","","21","","","Perspectives on aerosol deposition to natural surfaces: interactions between aerosol residence times, removal processes, the biosphere and global environmental change","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002185029090051X","0021-8502","1990","313-338","Journal of Aerosol Science"

Correspondingly, defining wine quality in terms of its chemistry will never be more than partially successful. Nonetheless, most serious wine connoisseurs tend to agree on what constitutes wine quality, that is, what they subjectively have come to like through extensive tasting. Although disappointingly nebulous, it has still been sufficient to guide grape growers and winemakers in their choice of the procedures they use. What is not certain is if this is a complex example of the blind leading the blind. This disturbing thought is partially supported by the unquestioning acceptance of certain traditions concerning grape and wine production, notably ideas about small berries, old vines, limited yield, avoidance of irrigation, etc., as being critical to wine quality. These have all been shown experimentally to be essentially false.

Consequently, this paper provides an overview of the natural and cultural context of earliest AMH (Anatomically Modern Humans). According to the locations and dating of AMH fossils, the focus is on E-Africa, NE-Africa and the Middle East within a time range from 200 ka to 70 ka. At least three different “contextual areas” appear to have existed at the time, two of them in E-Africa and NE-Africa, dominated by “Bifacial-plus-Levallois” technology, and the third one in the Middle East, mostly connected with an “only-Levallois” technology. A comparison with some non-AMH sites from Eurasia displays similarity of technological principles between artifact assemblages from African AMH sites and Eurasian non-AMH (early Neanderthal) sites on the one hand, and dissimilarity between African AMH sites and Middle Eastern AMH sites on the other hand. This is particularly surprising if environmental contexts are taken into account – tropical in Africa and glacial in Eurasia. Thus, compared to their archaic neighbors (particularly early Neanderthals), earliest modern humans currently seem to lack any specific “cultural fingerprint” and their demographic success may not be explained by behavioral superiority alone. The idea of a small group of early AMH people migrating out of Africa, enabled by cultural superiority over their neighbors appears highly questionable in the light of archaeological evidence. Moreover, the concept of virtual “migration routes” deserves a revision if ethnodemographic evidence about spatial behavior of hunter-gatherers is taken into account. The proposed concept of “contextual areas” serves as a methodological alternative, comprising linked cultural and environmental features.","","article","","274","","","“Contextual areas” of early Homo sapiens and their significance for human dispersal from Africa into Eurasia between 200 ka and 70 ka","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618212002753","1040-6182","2012","5-24","Quaternary International"

To better elucidate its implications on marine habitats, marine food webs, and human health, there is an urgent need to study and understand its distribution, behavior, and the way it interacts with biota. In addition, knowledge about the drivers affecting the bioavailability of plastics to organisms, as well as their potential toxicological and ecological effects, is still limited. While several field studies showed that Mediterranean Sea is strongly affected by plastic contaminants and resident organisms could ingest and interact with them on a daily basis, less information available regarding toxicity in wild organisms. Furthermore, laboratory trials have shown that microplastics can cause mild but adverse effects due to physical and chemical impacts (i.e., physical disturbance and release of additives and/or chemicals adsorbed from the environment). Despite the concerns raised by this evidence, the effects of microplastic ingestion in natural populations and the impacts on food webs are far from being completely understood. This chapter summarizes the available knowledge for Mediterranean benthic species, from both field and laboratory studies, and provides an overview of the presence and impact of plastics and microplastics in the marine environment, addressing the issue from the organism to the community level. The lack of knowledge on the role of chemical and morphological features of particles in modulating ingestion/egestion rates, toxicological effects, capability to adsorb pollutants, and/or release additives, as well as information on biological variables that may modulate ingestion phenomena, require special attention from researchers, to fully evaluate the ecological consequences of plastic pollution.","","incollection","Academic Press","","Plastic Pollution and Marine Conservation","978-0-12-822471-7","4 - Plastic impact on marine benthic organisms and food webs","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128224717000079","","2022","95-151",""

In this latest edition, the material has been reorganized so that it now starts with basic concepts regarding stochastic processes and introduces correlation functions as the first step toward defining spectral analysis. We examine the application of spectral analysis to stochastic series and discrete series, and provide a thorough treatment of traditional spectral methods. The chi-squared property of spectral estimates is introduced and discussed as a means of evaluating the statistical significance of spectral estimates. Spectral methods for vector series are briefly discussed, as are rotary spectral estimation methods. The effects of temporal or spatial sampling on the resultant spectral estimates are explored and the resultant aliasing is introduced and discussed, as are the implications for frequency resolution. The smoothing of spectral estimates, or windowing, is described and the implications of window selection on the significance of spectral estimates are examined. Simple band averaging is discussed as a smoothing method and the resultant confidence intervals for the spectrum are introduced. The concepts of spectral fidelity and stability are discussed as outcomes of smoothing decisions. The needs for zero padding and prewhitening are then introduced. Next the spectral analysis of unevenly spaced series is a unique topic of this chapter. It also provides a summary of the standard spectral analysis approach. The discussion then shifts to parametric methods of spectral analysis starting with autoregressive power spectral estimation. The maximum entropy spectral method is then introduced along with maximum likelihood spectral estimation. Next is cross-spectral analysis, where we no longer have strict power spectra but must deal with coherence and phase. The Fourier transform method is introduced and the practical applications of this method are detailed. Phase and cross-amplitude functions are discussed along with co- and quadrature spectra. The unique aspects of confidence levels to cross-spectra are then introduced. The frequency response of a linear system is described, along with rotary cross-spectra. Wavelet analysis is subsequently introduced as an alternative to standard spectral methods. Various wavelet algorithms are examined relative to their advantages and disadvantages. Oceanographic examples are presented to show how wavelet analysis can be used. In addition to wavelets the S-transform is discussed along with the multiple filter technique developed by geophysicists. Basic Fourier spectral analysis is then introduced to take advantage of the popular Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) now possible with digital computing facilities. FFT applications to both discrete and continuous time/space series are discussed and detailed. A least-squares FFT method is introduced again as a way of handling gappy time/space series. Computational examples are included with all of these procedures. A discussion of the harmonic analysis as applied to tidal time series is then presented. In earlier editions of this text harmonic analysis was presented before the discussion of spectral methods but the authors now consider harmonic analysis as a subset of the larger spectral analysis and hence it comes later. Computational tidal examples are included here. Special time series methods such as “regime shift detection” (including “sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts,” “adaptive Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filters,” and “cumulative upwelling index”) are introduced and discussed. Vector regression is also suggested as a time series analysis method. Fractals are suggested as another technique to decompose a time series.","Boston","incollection","Elsevier","","Data Analysis Methods in Physical Oceanography (Third Edition)","978-0-12-387782-6","Chapter 5 - Time Series Analysis Methods","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123877826000053","","2014","425-591",""

It is based on the Euler–Newton equations for body dynamics, implemented through the SPH formalism. This scheme has been coupled to a Weakly Compressible (WC)-SPH model for the main flow, based on the semi-analytic approach (Di Monaco et al. 2011). The SPH boundary treatment of Adami et al. (2012) has been implemented and adapted to free-slip conditions to model the “fluid–solid body” coupling terms. On the other hand, the “solid–solid” (“body–body” and “body–frontier”) interactions are represented by the “boundary force particles” of Monaghan (2005). This technique has been implemented by introducing some modifications to represent the impingements of entire bodies (not only isolated particles), even at low velocities. The new model has been validated on a sequence of 2D and 3D test cases. They involve preliminary tests both with single and multiple bodies and frontiers, four water entries of falling solid wedges, and the propagation of a 3D dam break front. This is driven by the regular lift of a mobile gate, transports a floating body (6 degrees of freedom) and impacts two fixed obstacles and several solid frontiers. This last phenomenon has also been experimentally realized during this study. Validation refers to comparisons vs. measurements, Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) results, other SPH models, analytical and theoretical solutions.","","article","","116","","","A Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model for 3D solid body transport in free surface flows","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045793015001334","0045-7930","2015","205-228","Computers & Fluids"

An observational paleoshoreline record is provided by emergent paleoshoreline indicators formed at higher relative sea levels, hence standing at higher elevations than modern counterparts. Emergent paleoshoreline notches in limestone seacliffs record paleo-high-tide levels and emergent paleoreef flats record paleo-low-tide levels, whereas emergent paleobeachrock locally records paleo-intertidal levels. Both paleonotches and paleoreefs occur along the coasts of high-standing islands exposing volcanic bedrock and uplifted reef complexes, but low-lying coralline atolls lack sufficient relief to preserve paleonotches. Controls on relative Holocene sea level include global eustatic and regional hydro-isostatic changes in ambient sea level relative to island landmasses, and shifts in the elevations of islands relative to sea level caused by thermal subsidence of the oceanic lithosphere or thermally rejuvenated loci of hotspot volcanism, by flexure of the lithosphere under the load of growing volcanic edifices (Hawaii, Samoa, Society Islands), by arching of the lithosphere over trench forebulges (Loyalty Islands, Niue, Bellona–Rennell), and by tectonism within forearc belts between active volcanic chains and trenches (Mariana Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu). The dominant pattern of relative sea-level change, where not overprinted by local tectonism or lithospheric flexure, was a uniform early Holocene rise in eustatic sea level followed by a regionally variable late Holocene hydro-isostatic drawdown in sea level. The resultant was a mid-Holocene highstand in relative sea level that affected the development of shoreline morphology throughout the tropical Pacific Ocean. The earliest human migrations into intra-oceanic island groups of both the northwestern and southwestern Pacific Ocean followed close on the heels of the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand, and took advantage of newly attractive coastal environments engendered by sea-level drawdown. The effects of the mid-Holocene highstand were modified to varying degrees in different island groups by geodynamic uplift or subsidence.","","article","","55","","","Paleoshoreline record of relative Holocene sea levels on Pacific islands","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825201000630","0012-8252","2001","191-234","Earth-Science Reviews"

Using a combination of stratigraphic evidence, geochronologic dating (14C and OSL), stable isotope analyses, and water geochemistry along the Rio Moquegua in the northern fringes of the Atacama Desert, we assemble a paleoflood chronology for mainstem and tributary sections for the past ca. 20 ka and ascertain the variation in ENSO frequency and magnitude. Because of the inherent watershed structure and regional hydroclimatology, mid-valley tributaries of the Rio Moquegua only flood during El Niño episodes and thus provide an important proxy of extreme El Niños while mainstem stratigraphy records both La Niña and El Niño episodes. El Niño floods appear to have been pronounced during the Late Pleistocene and up to at least the Younger Dryas (~12,000 cal yr BP) while stratigraphic evidence of large El Niño floods is lacking in tributary systems during the Mid-Holocene. Flood stratigraphy in a ~2 ka 7 m high terrace along the mainstem indicates an increased frequency and magnitude of large floods between ca. 700 and 1610 AD as compared to the period from ca. 160 BCE to 700 AD with “mega-Niños” occurring ca. 1330 AD and ca. 1650 AD. Water geochemistry and radiocarbon dating indicate that at least two major aquifers exist, with wells and springs in the mid-valley dating to 710 and 3100 14C yr BP, respectively, while water from a spring in the headwaters dates to 10,320 14C yr BP. This range in dates suggests that groundwater flow in the mid-valley is neither fossil water nor exclusively recharged from local precipitation while the older date for headwater sections suggests a more fossil groundwater source and lack of contemporary recharge. The 18O similarity between groundwater in the mid-valley and the regional meteoric water line (MWL) suggests a Pacific moisture source and the role of El Niño precipitation in recharging local aquifers. Thus, El Niños and Pacific-sourced moisture are an important component of the regional hydroclimatology and the variation in ENSO frequency and intensity has significant social and hydrologic repercussions in these hyper-arid settings.","","article","","101","","","Late Quaternary hydroclimatology of a hyper-arid Andean watershed: Climate change, floods, and hydrologic responses to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation in the Atacama Desert","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X08002237","0169-555X","2008","14-32","Geomorphology"

The main obstacles to deployment so far are technical challenges and cost. However, there are also concerns about how harnessing offshore energy can affect the local habitats and marine life, as well as introducing far-field and long-term changes in the physical environment of the sea, which may combine with climate change in unforeseen ways to affect marine ecosystems. The precautionary principle, combined with the requirement for monitoring, introduces obstacles (and costs) which have so far prevented the deployment of offshore renewable energy on a large scale. Here we discuss the physical changes that may occur and the impacts these may have on habitats, species and ecosystems. We explore the possible environmental impacts of offshore wind and marine energy deployment and the options for mitigation of these. This information can assist planners, regulators and developers of offshore energy systems. Some examples of existing and proposed deployments are provided (mainly focusing on the UK), in order to illustrate discussion of the environmental issues. We identify the need for better understanding of the environmental impacts at a population and ecosystem level and identify a way forward to improve the environmental consenting process.","Oxford","incollection","Elsevier","","Comprehensive Renewable Energy (Second Edition)","978-0-12-819734-9","9.04 - Environmental Issues for Offshore Renewable Energy☆","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128197271000364","","2022","25-59",""

While climate reconstructions and palynological research have focused on forces that drive the geomorphologic system, many researchers have attempted to use sediment archive studies to identify periods of change in sediment dynamics. Due to the large variability in environmental parameters and the variety of landscapes present in the Eastern Mediterranean region, research has focused on sediment archives ranging from small colluvial sites to deltas of large rivers on the Mediterranean coast. As the cultural record for the region is extremely rich, the main goal of palaeo-environmental research in the Eastern Mediterranean has been to identify the relative importance of human impact on the landscape. Nevertheless, sediment archives have significant limitations: chronological control for many palaeo-environmental records is highly uncertain, and rates of landscape change are oftentimes difficult to assess. Most palaeo-environmental research has been conducted on or near archeological sites, where direct human impact may obscure the indirect impact on sediment dynamics through land-use changes. Quantification and modeling of sediment dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean environment offer one solution. When erosion and sediment transport rate analyses are incorporated, periods of relatively important change can be identified. Using multiple approaches the relative importance of the main driving forces, climate and land use, become distinguishable. Since field-based data from the actual sediment archives remain vital, an overview of numerous studies in the Eastern Mediterranean is provided in order to draw a general picture for different time periods and the relative scale of regional landscape development during the Holocene. A comparison of sediment dynamics with the record of driving forces indicates that while climate was the main driver of the geomorphic system during the early Holocene, at some point human impact became widespread and began to dictate sediment dynamics to a large extent. From the Byzantine Period onward soil properties seem to play an increasingly important role, as the hillslope soil reservoir in the Eastern Mediterranean was progressively depleted during the late Holocene.","","article","","108","","","Holocene environmental change and its impact on sediment dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825211000882","0012-8252","2011","137-157","Earth-Science Reviews"

Data were compiled from 11 cities throughout East and Southeast Asia, with particular focus on Singapore, Jakarta, Hong Kong, and Naha (Okinawa). Our review highlights several key characteristics of urban coral reefs, including “reef compression” (a decline in bathymetric range with increasing turbidity and decreasing water clarity over time and relative to shore), dominance by domed coral growth forms and low reef complexity, variable city-specific inshore-offshore gradients, early declines in coral cover with recent fluctuating periods of acute impacts and rapid recovery, and colonization of urban infrastructure by hard corals. We present hypotheses for urban reef community dynamics and discuss potential of ecological engineering for corals in urban areas.","","article","","135","","","Urban coral reefs: Degradation and resilience of hard coral assemblages in coastal cities of East and Southeast Asia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X18305277","0025-326X","2018","654-681","Marine Pollution Bulletin"

The first approach discussed is a broad one that relates mineralization to the types of rock that may occur in a region. Attention is focussed on hydrothermal deposits and their association with specific types of igneous rocks and their differentiation trends. A second considers the control of the structure and physico-chemical properties of the host rocks on the localization of ore bodies. A number of factors, such as effective and total porosity and the brittleness of rocks also plays an important role in determining the nature and extent of dispersion haloes of the elements around ore deposits. In some instances it is possible to predict the presence of ore bodies at depth from the type of composition of metasomatized rocks that occur at the surface. The use of mercury and fluorine in the search for concealed deposits has been given detailed consideration. Methods based on fluorine may be effective in the discovery of skarn, greisen, hydrothermal and rare metal deposits. When using the fluorine content of waters from a taiga-permafrost terrain, it is important to consider the effect of the organic content of the water. In searching for Cu-Ni deposits of the Noril'sk type it is suggested that intrusive complexes characterized by high degrees of differentiation and containing picritic and taxitic facies enriched in Mg, Ni and Co and depleted in alkalis are the most prospective. Ore deposits of this type may have dispersion haloes of Ag, Bi, Zn and Pb which are associated with ore-controlling faults. Magnesian and calcareous skarns, feldspathic and serpentine-chlorite-prehnite rocks may form broad contact haloes with ore-bearing intrusions. The use of gases in prospecting for Cu-Mo deposits in Central Kazakhstan have been investigated with positive results. Gas surveys carried out in conjunction with geophysical methods makes it possible to distinguish zones of Cu-Mo mineralization from zones containing pyrite and carbonaceous material, all of which give similar geophysical responses. The occurrences of uranium in aquifers on the flanks of artesian basins within arid regions is used as an example of the use of geochemical zonation in prospecting. The same approach may be used in prospecting for copper-bearing sandstones.","","article","","2","","","Some aspects of the problem of geochemical methods of prospecting for concealed mineralization","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375674273900010","0375-6742","1973","193-235","Journal of Geochemical Exploration"

In principle the total ecosystem of the Esk estuary is labelled with a variety of radionuclides which we have studied in order to investigate fundamental process which take place in estuaries; also to improve our knowledge of relationships which exist between the rate of release of radionuclides in the BNFL source term and their distribution in the Esk. On the basis of defined sampling procedures we have dated the rate of sedimentation for the major sediment types of the system using six different radionuclides, and four independent methods, including a procedure of statistical modelling. The model is based upon procedures for matching the shape of the BNFL radionuclide release profile over a period of ∼ 10 y, with that for the distribution of radionuclides in profiles of sediment cores. Good agreement is obtained for the match. In the Esk a large proportion of the radionuclides which are retained in sediments are associated with particulate matter and surfaces of sediment debris; in accreting sediments these deposits have not been disturbed during the past ∼ 30 y. In modelling the releases of radionuclides from point sources, attention needs to be paid to the chemical and physical composition of the source term, as this can influence the subsequent distribution of radionuclides in nearshore and estuarine marine ecosystems.","","article","","35","","","The recent sedimentation history of the esk estuary, Cumbria, U.K.: The application of radiochronology","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969784900111","0048-9697","1984","325-386","Science of The Total Environment"

Herein, the CZCS pigment observations between late 1978 and mid-1986 north of 10°N, including the outer Gulf of Oman, are depicted for 14 subregions beyond the continental shelves as daily means, often only five days apart. To eliminate bias from electronic overshoot, the data were reprocessed with a more conservative cloud screen than used for NASA's Global Data Set. The pattern, derived from the older in situ observations, of one period with elevated chlorophyll almost everywhere during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) and one additional late-winter bloom in the north, is confirmed. The differing nitrate silicate ratios in freshly entrained water in the central and northern Arabian Sea seem to lead to different succession and perhaps to differing vertical fluxes, and during winter favor blooms only in the north. The spatial pigment pattern in the outer Gulf of Oman is not an extension of that of the northwestern Arabian Sea. The seasonal physical forcing explains much of the timing of pigment concentration changes, but not the levels maintained over long periods. From the CZCS observations it is unclear whether the period of high phytoplankton productivity expected during the SWM in the open Arabian Sea lasts for about two or four months. During this entire season, chlorophyll values in the upper layers rarely exceed 1–2mgm−3 outside the zone influenced by the Arabian upwelling. Near 15°N, however, fluxes into sediment traps at 3km depth indicate an onset of high primary production very soon after the arrival of the SWM and suggest a long period of high production in the open sea. The partial temporal disconnect during the SWM between pigment changes in the upper part of the euphotic zone and of fluxes into the traps is disconcerting. For future modeling of plankton production in the open Arabian Sea, the use of two size classes of phytoplankton is recommended. The utility of satellite-derived pigment concentrations (as opposed to temporal changes of pigment) for testing such models is questioned.","","article","","47","","","Geographical differences in seasonality of CZCS-derived phytoplankton pigment in the Arabian Sea for 1978–1986","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064599001575","0967-0645","2000","1623-1677","Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography"

The impact of shelf processes is examined with regard to both the availability of resources to fishing and their abundance. Three shelf processes, namely low oxygen water events, mesoscale processes, and boundary processes, are examined separately and in detail. For each of these processes, the resource impacted and its response, the type of forecast considered appropriate and feasible, the requirements for making such forecasts, and case studies illustrating examples of forecasting systems already in place, are provided. Other processes that may have significant impacts on living marine resources are briefly discussed. The technology for forecasting low oxygen water events is available and therefore the feasibility of making such predictions is good, although at present there are insufficient moored instruments dedicated to inshore oxygen monitoring in relevant areas, either in the northern or southern Benguela regions. Indices of mesoscale processes have been used in attempts to forecast anchovy recruitment variability in the southern Benguela, and indices of boundary processes to hindcast hake recruitment variability in the northern Benguela. For southern Benguela anchovy, the wealth of studies relating environmental variability to recruitment variability and the insights gained from simulating the incorporation of predictive models into management procedures for this stock, should allow the development of recruitment prediction models that can feasibly be incorporated into management procedures. However, the incorporation of environmentally-based recruitment or stock size prediction models into management procedures should take account of assumptions and uncertainties associated with such models, and their potential for utility to management should be tested through simulation.","","incollection","Elsevier","14","Benguela","","14 Forecasting shelf processes of relevance to living marine resources in the BCLME","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570046106800194","1570-0461","2006","309-347",""

The position of India remains problematical, but geological and geophysical data support a Pangea reconstruction. Traditionally India has always been regarded as a part of Gondwana as it shares two unique geologic features with other southern continents. These are the Upper Paleozoic glacial strata and the Glossopteris flora. However, neither line of evidence definitely proves continuity of land; together they indicate zonation of cold climates. The recent discovery of Upper Paleozoic glacial strata in the U.S.S.R., southern Tibet, Saudi Arabia, Oman, China, Malaya, Thailand, and Burma demonstrates that the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation was far more extensive beyond the Gondwana limit than is usually thought. Similarly the Glossopteris flora has been found farther north of the Indian Peninsula, in the Himalaya, Kashmir and Tibet. Moreover the floral similarities are explained easily by wind and insect dispersal. On the other hand, the distribution of large terrestrial tetrapods is strongly influenced by the distribution of continents. To terrestrial tetrapods, sea constitutes a barrier. In consequence, they are more reliable indicators of past land connections than are plants, invertebrates and fishes. The postulated separation of India from Antarctica, its northward journey, and its subsequent union with Asia, as suggested by the plate tectonic models, require that during some part of the Mesozoic or Early Tertiary India must have been an island continent. The lack of endemism in the Indian terrestrial tetrapods during this period is clearly inconsistent with the island continent hypothesis. On the contrary, Indian Mesozoic and Tertiary vertebrates show closest similarities to those of Laurasia, indicating that India was never far from Asia. The correlation of faunal similarity is extremly poor between India-Antarctica and India-Australia. This suggests that India cannot be placed alongside Antarctica or Australia in a pre-drift assembly. Moreover, the distribution of marine rocks indicates that India faced an open sea at its eastern margin during Proterozoic, Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Before the drift, India probably occupied the position between Somalia and Asia, and the Tethys was narrow and intracontinental. With the spreading of the Carlsberg Ridge in the Upper Cretaceous, the Indian block rotated counter-clockwise in relation to Africa to converge to Asia, with the opening up of the Arabian Sea. The rotational movement of India is supported by hot spot trajectory and reversal of paleoslopes of the ancient Gondwana rivers. There is a possible genetic relation between the Arabian sphenochasm and the origin of the Himalaya. With continued convergence of India to Asia, limited subduction occured at the Indus Suture along the axis of the Tethys; the further compression led to the closure of the Tethys followed by foldings, faultings and large-scale intracratonic subductions to form the Himalaya. The Himalayan uplift probably began in the Miocene, but went more actively in the Quaternary.","","article","","1","","","The paleoposition of India","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0743954786900206","0743-9547","1986","145-189","Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences"

"PAVITT197611","K. Pavitt and W. Walker","","","","","","1","","https://doi.org/10.1016/0048-7333(76)90017-2","Existing economic theories show that continuing innovation, diffusion, and technical and managerial improvement are necessary for economic growth and international competitiveness in the industrially advanced countries. But knowledge of why, where and how governments should intervene in the processes of industrial innovations stems more from trial and error than from systematic empirical information of the nature and extent of the hindrances to economically and socially desirable innovations, and of the effectiveness of alternative government policies to remove them. Nonetheless, past empirical studies do offer some clues. Differences amongst industrial sectors. The sources of new technology vary widely amongst inustrial sectors: in the costs of innovation, in the relative importance of outside suppliers of equipment and materials, of large and small firms, and of full-time R & D departments as compared to part-time innovative activities (sect. 7, 8). Similarly, the conditions for successful innovation vary amongst sectors (sect.6). Thus, government policies designed to influence innovation are likely to act with different intensities in different industries. The management of innovation. Nonetheless, there are some features common to innovation in different industries. Considerable costs beyond R & D are often necessary before the innovations reach commercial use (sect.4). And the following managerial characteristics are in general associated with successful innovation: a deliberate policy of seeking innovations; close and careful attention to customer requirements; good personal communications both within the firm and with outside sources of relevant knowledge; a style of management that is ‘organic’ and ‘participatory’ rather than ‘hierarchical’ and ‘authoritarian’; strong project leadership; and a strong engineering capability (sect. 6). R & D managers are still unable to predict the outcome of R & D projects to a useful degree of accuracy and, in the literature on methods of project selection, very little attention is paid to market uncertainties. Furthermore, a greater use of conventional investment appraisal criteria in deciding on R & D projects may re-inforce the already observed tendency in industry towards short-term, low-risk projects, to the neglect of longer-term, high-risk projects (sect. 5). Governments should therefore examine whether the benefits of policies towards education and management advisory services for innovation might outweigh their costs. They may also have a significant role to play in financing longer-term research that is basic to the development of industrial technology (subsect. 12.5). The nature of market and production demands. The direction of industrial innovation is often very sensitive to market and production demands (sect. 3). This fact, together with the high degree of market uncertainty facing innovating firms (sect. 5), suggest that governments can potentially influence both the pace and the direction of industrial innovation through their influence on the scale of industrial, consumer and public service demands. However, this potential influence will become real only if users of innovations are able to specify the innovations that they need, or to evaluate those that they get. This is generally the case for industrial demand, but not in consumer and public service markets, where fashion, insensitivity to users' needs and lack of technical competence often prevail. Government-funded technological institutes and laboratories are ideally placed to provide such technical competence (sub-sect. 12.3). Economic incentives and rewards for innovation. A whole range of economic factors are said to influence the resources, the incentives and the rewards for innovation: for example, the degree of monopoly or the degree of competition, the patent system, the level of profits, the level of taxation, and the level of demand. The empirical evidence on the effects of most of these factors on industrial innovation is either inconclusive or non-existent. However, in the USA a close relationship has been observed between growth of industry sales and growth of industry-financed R & D activities (sect. 10). The rate of growth of demand is also one of the key factors influencing the rate of diffusion of innovations amongst their potential population of users (sects. 11, 12.2). The government-financed scientific and technological infrastructure. Scientific and technological knowledge from outside of innovating firms is often crucial to the completion of successful innovations, and three UK studies show that a significant proportion of this outside knowledge comes from government-financed technological institutes and laboratories, and from the universities (sect. 3). If the same is true in other countries, it should be an essential feature of any government policy towards industrial innovation to know how effectively government-funded laboratories and universities provide supportive knowledge to industry, and how government laboratories should be organised and financed (subsect. 12.4). Direct government-financing of innovative activities in industry. Governments specifically finance R & D activities in industrial firms, although these expenditures are less than those for general industrial development (sect. 13). These R & D activities in industry are relatively more important in France and UK, than in F.R. Germany and the Netherlands. In the four countries, more than 70% of all civilian government R & D activities related to industry are spent on aircraft, space, nuclear energy and electronics (subsect. 14.4). In all these high technologies, governments attempted in the 1960's to implement ‘policies for innovation’, involving government procurement, industrial mergers and attempts at European co-operation, in addition to the financing of R & D (subsect. 14.5). Government expenditures on civilian R & D related to other industrial sectors are very much smaller in all four countries (subsect 14.4). Where should governments intervene? A, number of attempts have been made to develop a formal framework of criteria to assist governments in deciding where they should intervene in industrial innovation. They all run into the following difficulties: dealing with multiple policy objectives; assessing national costs and benefits; comparing with alternative policies, choosing appropriate policy instruments (sect. 17). How should governments intervene? Very little information is available on the effectiveness of various policy instruments that have been used by governments in order to promote innovation in industry. Although it is often possible to measure the inputs into such policies, the measurement of their outputs (or results) is more difficult. Nonetheless, detailed studies would enable some such measurements to be made, and internationally comparable studies would increase the range of experiences and the number of cases that could be examined (sect. 18). Why should governments intervene? A full appreciation of the nature and scale of hindrances to industrial innovation, on which governments should act to remove, requires direct information on what innovations are (or are not) being introduced by industry, and why they are (or are not) being inyroduced. This information can best be obtained from analyses of the behaviour of industrial firms. They would differ from most existing innovation studies that concentrate on asking how firms must behave in order to make successful innovation, by asking what innovations are attempted, and why firms are stimulated to attempt them (sect. 19).","","article","","5","","","Government policies towards industrial innovation: a review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048733376900172","0048-7333","1976","11-97","Research Policy"

The Industrial Revolution accelerated supplies of desert Fe-rich dust and Hg-rich coal ash to both stimulate more marine harmful algal blooms (HABs) and poison more humans by 1800. Sea spray–entrained aerosols of no longer eaten HAB carriers of marine neurotoxins were blown ashore to be inhaled by immuno-compromised inland human residents. Their binary immune system was ill equipped to deal with both parasites and allergens. Onshore desert minerals and coal ashes inversely moved seaward toward coastal human populations, who were thus subject to parasite diseases of tuberculosis, malaria, sleeping sickness, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, invasive aspergillosis, and viral vectors of at least five hemorrhagic fevers, while also their lungs were exacerbated at the same times by abiotic smoke, silicon dust, and mercury toxins.

"BLANCHARD196373","Duncan C Blanchard","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/0079-6611(63)90004-1","The work in this paper has been directed towards an evaluation of the quantity of electric charge that is separated at the surface of the sea. As the carriers of the charge are particles that arise from the sea by wind and wave action, it was necessary to determine first the flux of particles across the sea and the manner in which the particles originated. Then, laboratory studies were carried out to determine the sign and magnitude of the particle charge. The data from these two separate investigations were combined to obtain an estimate of the charge separation by the world ocean. It was concluded that a majority of the particles that arise from the sea evolve from bubbles that break at the sea surface. These particles come from both the bubble film and the breakdown of a jet which rises at high speeds from the bottom of the collapsing bubble cavity. The film drop flux was computed directly from a knowledge of the world ocean white-cap coverage. The flux of jet drops, on the other hand, was computed indirectly, first by assuming a steady state between the source and the sink of the jet drops and then by computing their fall-out rate by sedimentation, rain washout, and advection over the continents. The charge on the film drops was obtained with a Millikan-continuous diffusion cloud chamber and that on the jet drops by a modified Millikan chamber. The charge Q (esu) on the top jet drop from sea water was found to be positive and a function of both drop radius R (microns) and bubble age T (sec). For bubbles of an age of less than 10 sec this charge can be approximated by the expression Q = 1.76 × 10−8T0.4R1.3. The world ocean charge flow that is carried by film drops was found to be negligible, being far less than 1A. That carried by jet drops, however, was calculated to be about 160 A. This is about 17 per cent of the magnitude of the air-earth current over the world ocean that has been attributed to thunderstorm activity. The jet drop charge flux has been determined for both the winter and summer seasons and as a function of latitude. In both hemispheres and in both seasons the oceanic charge separation attains a maximum at latitudes of 40 to 60° and reaches its highest value of 3.2 × 10−7 esu cm−2 sec−1 at about 50° S. latitude in June–August. Two factors that may modify both the jet drop size and its charge were considered in detail. The first is that of organic surface-active films on the surface of the ocean. Experiments showed that the removal of surface films by jet drops was a function of bubble size and suggested that most of the drops that take part in the charge transfer are sufficiently small that they do not carry away any of the surface-active film. The reason for this appears to be that the small drops from the jets bubbles evolve so rapidly that the surface film does not have time to move into the collapsing bubble cavity and to cover the jet. Calculation showed that the drop ejection velocity was an inverse function of bubble size and attained a value of several thousand centimeters per second for drops from the smaller bubbles. The question of surface films at sea was discussed, and it was shown that one has reason to suspect that film collapse by wind and surface water convergences might prevent them from covering a significant area of the ocean. For these reasons it was concluded that the effects of surface films on the computed charge production were of no significance. The second factor that could modify the jet drop charge is the induction charging that is caused by the earth's electric field, normally 1 V cm−1 at the surface of the sea. This factor, however, was found to be of no great significance, as experiment indicated that the amount of induction charging by such small electric fields was less than 5 per cent of that charge which the drops carried in the absence of a field. Evidence for the 160 A positive current from the world ocean was drawn from two sources. The first, that of space charge measurements in air that had passed over the sea where a great deal of bubbling was occurring, indicated that a net positive space charge was carried by the drops that left the sea in this region. The second source gave evidence that was suggestive though not conclusive. It was shown that the latitudinal distribution of the oceanic electric field had two maxima, one in each hemisphere, in the same latitudes as did the computed oceanic charge separation. But it could not be proved that the oceanic charge separation caused the latitudinal variation in the electric field, for it was shown that such variation could conceivably come about by an appropriate latitudinal variation of the convection current. Finally, it was suggested that the jet drop charge arises from a charge separation of the electric double layer that surrounds the bubble. This separation is thought to be a consequence of laminar shear flow within the rising jet with the result that the water that constitutes the faster moving, positively charged core of the jet ends up as a positively charged jet drop.","","article","","1","","","The electrification of the atmosphere by particles from bubbles in the sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0079661163900041","0079-6611","1963","73-202","Progress in Oceanography"

A Critical Literature Review","","","","","1","","https://doi.org/10.1016/0141-1136(86)90013-9","This review of the literature on neoplastic or cancer-like disorders in fish and shellfish sets out to (1) summarize what is known of the occurrence of neoplastic diseases in indigenous populations of aquatic animals found in different geographic areas of the world; (2) critically evaluate existing reports so as to determine whether or not environmental pollutants are implicated as causal agents of the cellular disorders and (3) describe the current state of knowledge in the general areas of fish and shellfish metabolism and the use of aquatic animal models in studies of chemical carcinogenesis. Tumors and neoplasms have been described in fish and shellfish populations from many areas throughout the world. Although environmental pollutants have been suggested as the cause of neoplasms in at least some cases, the existing evidence does not permit a firm conclusion. For fish, the quality of the reports and data reviewed varied considerably. There are rather good experimental data to suggest that cancer-like conditions in fish from certain areas of Puget Sound (Washington), the Fox River (Illinois) and Japan are associated with chemical contaminants in the environment. The data purported to support a chemical etiology for highly publicized tumors in fish from the Buffalo River, Torch Lake and Black River are not of a high quality. Most of the studies from those areas are compromised by inadequate experimental designs, and further research will be necessary to achieve a more complete in relation to the existence of tumors in fish from those areas. There are also reports providing impressive evidence that chemical pollutants are not associated with neoplasms in fish, even in those inhibiting environments known to contain mutagenic substances. Large surveys conducted from highly polluted aquatic systems in Yugoslavia (Sava River), Germany (Rhine and Elbe Rivers) and Australia (Port Phillip Bay) all reported negative results. Many other studies and surveys have produced data that neither supported nor refuted a pollution-neoplasm association. In contrast to fish, there is little evidence that neoplasms of clams, oysters and mussels are associated in any significant way with environmental pollution. The most obvious conclusion, from reviewing the existing literature, is that much additional research is required before the relationship(s) between environmental pollution and neoplasms in indigenous aquatic species can be understood. There are severe constraints associated with conducting credible field studies in this area, given the incalculable number of variables in natural environments. In the future, it may be advisable to place more emphasis on laboratory studies employing state-of-the-art methods to provide fundamental information that can be used to understand the nature and causes of neoplasms in aquatic species.","","article","","20","","","Cancerous diseases in aquatic animals and their association with environmental pollutants: A critical literature review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0141113686900139","0141-1136","1986","1-141","Marine Environmental Research"

Altogether 9.6 million tonnes of tin, equivalent to 54% of the world's tin production is derived from this region. Most of the granitoids in the region can be grouped geographically into elongate provinces or belts, based on petrographic and geochronological features. - The Main Range Granitoid Province in western Peninsular Malaysia, southern Peninsular Thailand and central Thailand is almost entirely made up of biotite granite (184–230 Ma). Tin deposits associated with these granites contributed 55% of the historic tin production of Southeast Asia. - The Northern Granitoid Province in northern Thailand (0.1% of tin production) also has dominant biotite granite (200–269 Ma) but it is distinguished by abundant post-intrusion deformation. - The Eastern Granitoid Province extends from eastern Peninsular Malaysia to eastern Thailand. The Malaysian part is subdivided into the East Coast Belt (220–263 Ma), Boundary Range Belt (197–257 Ma) and Central Belt (79–219 Ma). The granitoids cover a wide compositional range from biotite granite to hornblende-biotite granite/granodiorite and diorite-gabbro. Tin deposits are associated with biotite granite in the East Coast Belt (3% of tin production). The granitoids in the other areas of the Eastern Granitoid Province are barren. - The Western Granitoid Province (22–149 Ma) in northern Peninsular Thailand, western Thailand and Burma has biotite granite and hornblende-biotite granite/granodiorite. Tin deposits are associated with biotite granite, which probably is the dominant phase (14% of tin production). The granitoids of the Indonesian Tin Islands (193–251 Ma) do not permit grouping into geographically distinct units. Main Range-type and Eastern Province-type plutons occur next to each other. Most of the tin deposits are associated with Main Range-type plutons (28% of tin production). Tin-mineralized plutons are characterized by high concentrations of SiO2, K2O, Rb, Sn, Th and U, whereas the concentrations of Fe2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, Ba and Sr as well as the Fe2O3FeO ratios are low. Tin-mineralized plutons are also distinguished by high initial 87Sr86Sr ratios low magnetic susceptibilities.","","article","","38","","","The Southeast Asian tin belt","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001282529500004T","0012-8252","1995","95-293","Earth-Science Reviews"

Industry standards used in each production facility are specified in the general and equipment specifications developed for the facility by the operator(s). Specified standards normally conform to the laws and legal codes of the host country or the laws of a country mutually agreed by both the operator and the governing agencies. The Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has been issuing standards for the petroleum industry since 1999. ISO Technical Committee (ISO-TC67) is charged with preparing standards for a wide selection of materials, equipment, and offshore structures for the petroleum, petrochemical, and natural gas industries. This chapter discusses sucker rod pumping, stimulation and remedial operations, oil and gas production processing systems, offshore operations, environmental considerations, gas production engineering, and corrosion in production operations. The chapter also discusses drilling and well completion corrosion that is still pertinent to corrosion in production operations. A wide variety of engineered tools and structures are used in the production side of the oil and gas industry. Production equipment may also be exposed to a different set of environmental conditions that pose different corrosion potentials. These metals and their condition exhibit varying susceptibilities to the various potential corrosion reactions that are prevalent in the oilfield production environments.","Boston","incollection","Gulf Professional Publishing","","Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering (Third Edition)","978-0-12-383846-9","Chapter 6 - Production Engineering","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123838469000060","","2016","6-1-6-529",""

This is partially due to quality being primarily subjective, and strongly influenced by extrinsic factors. Correspondingly, defining wine quality in terms of its chemistry will never be more than partially successful. Nonetheless, most serious wine connoisseurs tend to agree on what constitutes wine quality—being what they subjectively have come to like through extensive tasting. Although disappointingly nebulous, it has still been sufficient to guide grape growers and winemakers in their choice of the procedures they use. What is not certain is if this is a complex example of the blind leading the blind. This disturbing thought is partially supported by the unquestioning acceptance of certain traditions concerning grape and wine production—notably ideas about small berries, old vines, limited yield, avoidance of irrigation, etc. as being critical to wine quality. These have all been shown experimentally to be essentially false. Thus, what is noted below is tentative.","","incollection","Academic Press","","Wine Tasting (Fourth Edition)","978-0-323-85263-0","Chapter 8 - Nature and Origins of Wine Quality","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323852630000028","","2023","381-423",""

In our previous work, we developed a framework for constructing Bayesian Network (BN) models to enable operators to distinguish between those two classes, including knowledge elicitation to construct the directed acyclic graph of BN models. In this paper, we add a systematic method for knowledge elicitation to construct the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) of BN models, thereby completing a holistic framework to distinguish between attacks and technical failures. In order to elicit reliable probabilities from experts, we need to reduce the workload of experts in probability elicitation by reducing the number of conditional probabilities to elicit and facilitating individual probability entry. We utilise DeMorgan models to reduce the number of conditional probabilities to elicit as they are suitable for modelling opposing influences i.e., combinations of influences that promote and inhibit the child event. To facilitate individual probability entry, we use probability scales with numerical and verbal anchors. We demonstrate the proposed approach using an example from the water management domain.","","article","","75","","","Probability elicitation for Bayesian networks to distinguish between intentional attacks and accidental technical failures","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214212623000819","2214-2126","2023","103497","Journal of Information Security and Applications"

Examples are provided from around the world and span a range of spatial scales from global coastal classifications to those for individual bays and estuaries. Technological advances in remote sensing, social-media analyses and artificial intelligence classifiers have diversified and improved the performance and application of biophysical coastal classifications and thematic maps. In the past decade, important progress has been made in the spatial representation of cultural values through participatory mapping and the integration of social-ecological patterns for coastal risk assessment. Mapping ecosystem services has become more widespread and the desire for environmental sustainability across sectors has seen a proliferation in predictive mapping applied to conservation prioritization and marine spatial planning.

Characterization, attribution, and retaliation are part of the most important aspects of responding to cyberattacks. The U.S. does not have a clearly defined characterization process, other than the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s Threat Table which characterizes the different motivations for carrying out cyberattacks by cyber threat actors. This Threat Table has hardly changed since 2005, yet, cyber threat actors continually develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and conceal their real motivations for carrying out cyberattacks. Like characterization, the U.S. does not have a known attribution procedure, nor is a single agency tasked with the function of attribution. Different agencies – the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) – and even private sectors companies, participate in the attribution process. This invites potential contradiction and interference with the attribution process. Though, unlike characterization and attribution, the U.S. retaliation policies are contained in different documents, none has the preciseness required to be effective. This paper thus, makes recommendations for each of these aspects of cyberattack response.","","article","","50","","","Critiquing the U.S. characterization, attribution and retaliation laws and policies for cyberattacks","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364923000572","0267-3649","2023","105847","Computer Law & Security Review"

The most recent climate scenarios identify with high certainty that the Indian Ocean (IO) is experiencing one of the fastest surface warming among the world's oceans. The area of surface waters of >28 °C (IO Warm Pool) has significantly increased during 1982–2021 by expanding into the northern-central basins. A significant decrease in pH and aragonite (building blocks of calcified organisms) levels in the IO was observed from 1981–2020 due to an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. There are also signals of decreasing trends in primary productivity in the north, likely related to enhanced stratification and nutrient depletion. Further, the rapid warming of the IO will manifest more extreme weather conditions along its adjacent continents and oceans, including marine heat waves that are likely to reshape biodiversity. However, the impact of climate change beyond the unprecedented warming, increase in marine heat waves, expansion of the IO Warm Pool, and decrease in pH, remains uncertain for many other key variables in the IO including changes in salinity, oxygen, and net primary production. Understanding the response of these physical, chemical, and biological variables to climate change is vital to project future changes in regional fisheries and identify mitigation actions. We accordingly conclude by identifying knowledge gaps and recommending directions for sustainable fisheries and climate impact studies.","","article","","906","","","Rapid climate change alters the environment and biological production of the Indian Ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723059697","0048-9697","2024","167342","Science of The Total Environment"

They are also core drivers of cumulative effects (CE) models, which are increasingly recognized as essential management tools to grapple with the diffuse footprint of human impacts. Here, we provide a process framework for the identification, development, and integration of SR functions into CE models, and highlight their consequential properties, behaviour, criteria for selecting appropriate stressors and responses, and general approaches for deriving them. Management objectives (and causal effect pathways) will determine the ultimate stressor and target response variables of interest (i.e., individual growth/survival, population size, community structure, ecosystem processes), but data availability will constrain whether proxies need to be used for the target stressor or response variables. Available data and confidence in underlying mechanisms will determine whether empirical or mechanistic (theoretical) SR functions are optimal. Uncertainty in underlying SR functions is often the primary source of error in CE modelling, and monitoring outcomes through adaptive management to iteratively refine parameterization of SR functions is a key element of model application. Dealing with stressor interactions is an additional challenge, and in the absence of known or suspected interaction mechanisms, controlling main effects should remain the primary focus. Indicators of suspected interaction presence (i.e., much larger or smaller responses to stressor reduction than expected during monitoring) should be confirmed through adaptive management cycles or targeted stressor manipulations. Where possible, management decisions should selectively take advantage of interactions to strategically mitigate stressor impacts (i.e., by using antagonisms to suppress stressor impacts, and by using synergisms to efficiently reduce them).","","article","","","","","A process framework for integrating stressor-response functions into cumulative effects models","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723060837","0048-9697","2023","167456","Science of The Total Environment"

Operations managers and scholars place great hopes on recent technological innovations, particularly blockchain technology. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive review at the intersection of SCRES and blockchain, making it difficult to understand the relations between both fields holistically. This research gap was addressed by systematically analyzing 72 peer-reviewed papers. More specifically, the link between specific blockchain characteristics, SCRES antecedents, and supply chain risk types was explored. The results reveal that visibility and validation are the most relevant blockchain characteristics for improving SCRES. The SCRES antecedents agility, collaboration, and supply chain (re-)engineering can all benefit from blockchain implementation, whereas the effect on risk management culture is widely unexplored. While there is consensus on blockchain’s usability for mitigating security, operational, and supply risks, the effect on demand risks requires further attention. To facilitate the practical implementation of this paper’s results, the findings served as a foundation for discussing SCRES opportunities from well-known blockchain applications such as smart contracts and tracking solutions.

However, the rational design for desired mechanical properties of these materials and structures remains a demanding topic. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the recent advances in additively manufactured materials and structures as well as their mechanical properties with an emphasis on energy absorption applications. First, the additive manufacturing techniques used for fabricating various materials and structures are briefly reviewed. Then, a variety of lightweight AM materials and structures are discussed, together with their mechanical properties and energy-absorption characteristics. Next, the AM-induced defects, their impacts on mechanical properties and energy absorption, as well as the methods for minimizing the effects are discussed. After that, numerical modeling approaches for AM materials and structures are outlined. Furthermore, design optimization techniques are reviewed, including parametric optimization, topology optimization, and nondeterministic optimization with fabrication-induced uncertainties. Notably, data-driven and machine learning-based techniques exhibit compelling potential in design for additive manufacturing, process-property relations, and in-situ monitoring. Finally, significant challenges and future directions in this area are highlighted.

Building Automation Systems (BAS) are increasingly important in improving energy efficiency in GB. This study, therefore, aims to comprehensively review 143 articles published from 2008 to 2022 to explore the nexus between BAS and GB.

In this study, a two-dimensional off-grid compressive beamforming method via weighted block ℓ1 norm regularization (WBS-OCSBF) is proposed. The weighted ℓ1 norm offers a more uniform sparsity penalty compared to the ℓ1 norm. This method can enhance the performance of off-grid compressive beamforming. Additionally, it is easily implemented on mature linear programming solvers and converges with only a few iterations. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the effects of several major parameters on the performance of the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over some traditional methods. The proposed method is then validated using a loudspeaker noises localization experiment.

An active frequency detection method previously used at Stromboli, Italy, uses the thermal- and mid-infrared wavelength bands from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to detect anomalies at a volcano. This method focuses on small scale explosive activity, often referred to as Strombolian activity which can produce small spatter fields near a volcano's active vent. In the North Pacific, there are a number of volcanoes which exhibit small scale explosive activity and three are the focus of this study: Chuginadak (Mt. Cleveland) and Shishaldin in Alaska, and Karymsky Volcano in Kamchatka. Satellite images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were used to monitor the frequency of thermal features as well as the occurrence of ash plumes at each volcano. This data was then used to produce a time series spanning 2005–2010 for all three volcanoes. During this time period, each volcano underwent a series of eruptive cycles including background levels of activity, heightened frequency of small explosions (identified as precursory activity), and heightened activity typified by ash plume-producing eruptions. Each location has a unique precursory signal, both in timing and magnitude. The use of a previously developed method on a new sample set of volcanoes has proved the validity of this method as a monitoring tool for volcanoes with small scale explosive activity. This method should be applied to a larger set of volcanoes to continue the development and database production for its use as a volcano monitoring tool.","","article","","286","","","Frequency based satellite monitoring of small scale explosive activity at remote North Pacific volcanoes","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027314002595","0377-0273","2014","1-14","Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research"

Five approaches were used to estimate the distribution of permafrost in the region: (1) correlation of permafrost distribution with mean annual air temperature isotherms, (2) mapping the distribution of periglacial features indicative of permafrost, (3) summarizing data from shallow excavations and boreholes, (4) detection of permafrost from geophysical techniques, and (5) application of models to predict the occurrence of permafrost. Whereas permafrost is continuous in the South Orkney Islands (60–61°S) and along the eastern Antarctic Peninsula (63–65°S), it is discontinuous in the South Shetland Islands (62–63°S), and occurs only sporadically in the Palmer Archipelago and Biscoe Islands along the western Antarctic Peninsula (64–66°S). Permafrost then becomes continuous on Alexander Island (71–74°S) along the western Antarctic Peninsula as the maritime climate shifts to a more continental climate. Reports prior to 1980 mention the presence of permafrost at depths of 25 to 35cm in ice-free areas near Palmer Station (64°46′S; 64°04′W), where the mean annual air temperature from extrapolation of data from the nearby Vernadsky Station has increased 3.4°C and the mean winter temperature has increased 6°C since 1950. Recent measurements suggest that permafrost is absent or close to 0°C in the upper 14m of the highest ice-free areas (67ma.s.l.) near Palmer Station. Permafrost temperatures elsewhere along the western Antarctic Peninsula region range from −0.4 to −1.8°C in the South Shetland Islands (62–63°S) to −3.1°C at Adelaide Island (67°34′S). Permafrost at this temperature is susceptible to thawing, which has resulted in historic increases in active-layer thicknesses and in thermokarst features such as debris flows, and active-layer detachment slides.","","article","","100","","","Climate warming and permafrost dynamics in the Antarctic Peninsula region","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092181811200207X","0921-8181","2013","215-223","Global and Planetary Change"

Based on >10,000 tree-ring measurements sampled across the systematic grid of the continuous French national forest inventory (NFI) over the 2006–2016 period, we evaluated the radial growth trends of eight conifer tree species prevalent in European forests across their native and introduced ranges and various bioclimatic contexts (n = 16 forest systems). For each forest system, radial increments were filtered out from tree, plot, soil and climatic normal influences to isolate environment-driven growth signals and quantify residual time-series. Associated growth trends across forest systems were then confronted against environmental variables (e.g. short-term averages and trends in seasonal climate). Trends for a given species were systematically more positive in cooler contexts (higher elevations or northern distribution margins) than in warmer contexts (plains). Decreases and increases in precipitation regimes were found to be associated with negative and positive tree growth trends, respectively. Remarkably, positive growth trends were mainly observed for native forest systems (7/9) and negative trends for introduced systems (5/7). Native forests showed a more heterogeneous forest structure as compared to introduced forests that, in line with observed positive dependence of tree growth trends onto both water availability and forest heterogeneity, appears to modulate the competitive pressure on water resource with ongoing summer maximum temperature increase. Over a short annually-resolved study period, we were able to capture tree growth responses coherent with climate change across diverse forest ecosystems. With ongoing accumulation of data, the continuous French NFI hence arises as powerful support to monitoring climate change effects on forests.","","article","","742","","","Recent growth trends of conifers across Western Europe are controlled by thermal and water constraints and favored by forest heterogeneity","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720339759","0048-9697","2020","140453","Science of The Total Environment"

This study aims to compare the effectiveness of meteorological drought indices against satellite-based agronomical drought indices as crop yield explanatory factors in statistical models calibrated at a local scale. The analysis is conducted in Spain using a spatially detailed, 12-year (2003–2015) dataset on crop yields, including different types of cereals. Yields and drought indices were spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level. The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), computed at different temporal aggregation levels, and two satellite-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), were used to characterise the dynamics of drought severity conditions in the study area. Models resting on satellite-based indices showed higher performance in explaining yield levels as well as yield anomalies for all the crops evaluated. In particular, VCI/TCI models of winter wheat and barley were able to explain 70% and 40% of annual crop yield level and crop yield anomaly variability, respectively. We also observed gains in explanatory power when models for climate zones (instead of models at the national scale) were considered. All the results were cross-validated on subsamples of the whole dataset and on models fitted to individual agricultural districts and their predictive accuracy was assessed with a real-time forecasting exercise. Results from this study highlight the potential for including satellite-based drought indices in agricultural decision support systems (e.g. agricultural drought early warning systems, crop yield forecasting models or water resource management tools) complementing meteorological drought indices derived from precipitation grids.","","article","","213","","","Comparison of meteorological and satellite-based drought indices as yield predictors of Spanish cereals","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377418305729","0378-3774","2019","388-396","Agricultural Water Management"

The interdiction scenario discussed in this paper includes an area of interest with multiple neutral and hostile objects moving through this area, and an interdiction force, consisting of an airborne sensor and an intercepting surface vessel or ground vehicle, whose objectives are to search, identify, track, and intercept hostile objects within a given time frame. The main contributions of this paper are addressing both airborne sensor and surface vessel simultaneously, developing a stochastic dynamic-programming model for optimizing their employment, and deriving operational insight. In addition, the search and identification process of the airborne sensor addresses both physical (appearance) and behavioral (movement pattern) signatures of a potentially hostile object. As the model is computationally intractable for real-world scenarios, we propose a simple heuristic policy, which is shown, using a bounding technique, to be quite effective. Based on a numerical case study of maritime interdiction operations, which includes several representative scenarios, we show that the expected number of intercepted hostile objects, following the heuristic decision policy, is at least 60% of the number of hostile objects intercepted following an optimal decision policy.","","article","","220","","","The eye and the fist: Optimizing search and interdiction","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221712001336","0377-2217","2012","550-558","European Journal of Operational Research"

Clinical data were obtained by chart review and electroretinogram testing. Mutations in the PAX6 gene were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism and characterized by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Eleven different PAX6 mutations, 10 of which are novel, were found. The four patients with congenital cataracts all had mutations in the C-terminal proline-serine-threonine (PST)–rich domain of the PAX6 protein. Electroretinograms of nine of 11 patients displayed depressed scotopic maximum response b-wave amplitudes. The greatest decrease in b-wave amplitudes was seen in patients in whom the paired domain was disrupted by mutation.

As a consequence, data on their occurrence, distribution and habitat preferences is scarce. In this area, 48 sea surveys along fixed transects within Continental Portugal and Madeira Island were performed in 2012 and 2013, from July to October, using platforms of opportunity. We used an environmental envelope approach and GAM habitat models to identify the role of oceanographic, topographic and geographical variables in shaping cetacean distribution. Results demonstrate the richness of offshore waters in this area as in 10,668nmi sampled, we recorded 218 sightings from at least nine cetacean species, resulting in an overall ER of 2.04 sightings/100nmi. The interaction of topographic and oceanographic features was shown to influence the distribution of the species/groups along the routes. Among the sighted species, only common dolphin showed a preference for coastal waters, while for all the other species high seas proved to be determinant. This result reinforces the need to address conservation issues in open ocean. This preliminary assessment showed the importance of the entire area for the distribution of different cetacean species and allowed the identification of several species/group specific potential suitable habitats. Considering the Habitats Directive resolutions, ACCOBAMS priorities, EEZ extension for the area and Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, and the urgent need for management plans, we suggest that the sampling strategy here presented is a cost-effective method to gather valuable data, to be used to improve cetacean habitat models in the area.","","article","","143","","","Cetacean occurrence and spatial distribution: Habitat modelling for offshore waters in the Portuguese EEZ (NE Atlantic)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796314002541","0924-7963","2015","73-85","Journal of Marine Systems"

For offshore CO2 storage, it is necessary to monitor CO2 concentration in seawater to ensure safe storage. However, such concentrations have large regional and seasonal variations due to biological activity. In our previous study, to avoid the misidentification of large natural fluctuations as abnormally high CO2 concentrations (false positive), a method was proposed using multiple indicators of CO2-related concentration in seawater: namely, anomalies are judged only if there are data that exceed statistical criteria, e.g. 3-sigma, of all the multiple correlations of different types. This is because any single indicator can have data exceeding such criteria in theory. In this study, we examined the universality of applying multiple indicators of different types to seawaters around the world. The results show that the world seawaters can be classified into three groups using the relationships between alkalinity and salinity and the vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen, and that at least one of the four indicators has a clear correlation in each group, suggesting that the applicability of the proposed method using multiple indicators has been proved.","","article","","112","","","Applicability of CO2-related concentration indicators by classifying various seawaters in the world","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583621002413","1750-5836","2021","103489","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

The average levels, in order of concentration, were 14.64 mg/kg As, 3.58 mg/kg Cr, 1.18 mg/kg Pb, 1.15 mg/kg Ni, and 0.07 mg/kg Cd. Dry weight concentrations described bioaccumulation of As and Cr, and, to a lesser extent, Ni and Pb. A hotspot of As at the station near the delta of Marangone stream reflected the effect of mine waste deposits of galena, pyrite, and marcasite in this basin. The As concentration in the northern part of the study area increased closer to the Mignone delta, and according to the prevailing winds, this could reflect enrichment from the combustion of coal at the Torrevaldaliga power plant. Comparing data with the literature, As in marine sediments show a ratio of 0.7 in the tissues of P. lividus from the Civitavecchia area. These results were also compared to those found in P. lividus in an environmental biomonitoring program currently ongoing to control the emissions from the coal-fired power plant in Torrevaldaliga Nord, highlighting a substantial quantitative correspondence. In view of the presence of various industrial activities in the study area that can influence the enrichment of these elements, this work emphasizes the need for performing further studies aimed at assessing the actual contribution of anthropogenic activities even when the background concentrations in marine sediments and marine organisms are high, because burning coal is considered the major anthropogenic source of many trace elements especially As.","","article","","1","","","Concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb in the echinoid Paracentrotus lividus on the coast of Civitavecchia, northern Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352485515000043","2352-4855","2015","7-17","Regional Studies in Marine Science"

Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the learnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator’s perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10−50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.","","article","","100","","","Insights and guidance for offshore CO2 storage monitoring based on the QICS, ETI MMV, and STEMM-CCS projects","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583620305454","1750-5836","2020","103120","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45° to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or “breaks”) contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%.","","article","","238","","","Continuous monitoring of land disturbance based on Landsat time series","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425719301002","0034-4257","2020","111116","Remote Sensing of Environment"

In this context, this paper proposes the application of a relatively new time series representation named “Shapelet transform”, which is based on local similarity in the shape of the time series subsequences. In consideration of the individual attributes distinctive to time series signals in earthquake, wind and ocean engineering, the application of this transform yields a new shape-based feature representation. Combining this shape-based representation with a standard machine learning algorithm, a truly “white-box” machine learning model is proposed with understandable features and a transparent algorithm. This model automates event detection without the intervention of domain practitioners, yielding a practical event detection procedure. The efficacy of this proposed shapelet transform-based autonomous detection procedure is demonstrated by examples, to identify known and unknown earthquake events from continuously recorded ground-motion measurements, to detect pulses in the velocity time history of ground motions to distinguish between near-field and far-field ground motions, to identify thunderstorms from continuous wind speed measurements, to detect large-amplitude wind-induced vibrations from the bridge monitoring data, and to identify plunging breaking waves that have a significant impact on offshore structures.","","article","","228","","","Applications of shapelet transform to time series classification of earthquake, wind and wave data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029620341651","0141-0296","2021","111564","Engineering Structures"

The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) acts to weaken the link between the SAM and Northern Hemisphere winter climate, with the zonal wind / divergence anomalies amplifying over the tropical Pacific Ocean when we exclude El Niño and La Niña years from the analysis. This remote link to the SAM thus occurs independent of ENSO via SAM-driven changes to the tropical atmospheric circulation, suggesting that the SAM may provide a useful predictive signal for the Northern Hemisphere during DJF. The SAM also influences the occurrence of daily low (below the 5th percentile) and high (above the 95th percentile) wave conditions, emphasizing that the SAM may be a valuable source of predictable wave variability from sub-weekly to seasonal timescales. Future work should explore wave data suitable for trend analysis, considering the positive trend in the SAM over recent decades.","","article","","129","","","Southern annular mode impacts on global ocean surface waves","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500318300441","1463-5003","2018","58-74","Ocean Modelling"

Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake becomes a representative ecological degradation region in northwestern China. The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of inter-month dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data. The dynamic thresholds of classification were selected using Otsu method and the results showed that the classification results were acceptable with the optimal overall accuracy of 99.94% and kappa coefficient of 0.9971, respectively. We conduct a time series analysis of surface areas of Ebinur Lake using S1A data from February 9th, 2017 to February 4th, 2018. The maximum lake surface area was 965.29 km2 in April 22nd, 2017, while the minimum value was 750.37 km2 in September 1st, 2017, and the mean area was 831.51 km2. The seasonal variations showed the stages of “sharp rising” – “significant decreasing” – “gradual stabilizing” in the study period. The water surface area was highly correlated with inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P < 0.001). The variation of Ebinur Lake's water surface area is crucial to monitor the resulting eco-environmental impacts under the changing environmental conditions in the arid and semi-arid areas.","","article","","177","","","Dynamic detection of water surface area of Ebinur Lake using multi-source satellite data (Landsat and Sentinel-1A) and its responses to changing environment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816219300700","0341-8162","2019","189-201","CATENA"

First the quality and reliability of the data set is discussed. An uncertainty analysis showed that if, on one hand, the site heterogeneity and set-up changes may strongly affect yearly NEP estimates, questioning thus the total carbon budget relevance, on the other hand, robust inter-annual anomalies may be obtained as long as a site dedicated data treatment is carefully applied. A validation of the anomalies by comparison with a growth index derived from tree ring measurements is given. The resulting anomalies (range: [−206; + 123] g C m−2 yr−1, standard deviation: 93 g C m−2 yr−1) being larger than their own uncertainty (∼30 g C m−2 yr−1), an inter-annual variability analysis is possible. This analysis shows that the sources of NEP inter-annual variability at the Vielsalm station are multiple but the most prominent causes are biotic processes driven by carry-over effects of preceding meteorological events. The lowest observed NEP, in 2000, resulted from a bark beetle attack probably prompted by an early frost event in 1998. Besides, the robust lagged correlation between NEP anomalies and mean vapor pressure deficit during the preceding vegetation season also suggests a carry-over effect of water limitation during the previous year on the beech NEP. Mechanisms driving this carry-over effect are supposedly linked to tree physiology, which is confirmed by a dependency of canopy photosynthetic capacity to previous year water limitation. Some hypotheses, involving biomass allocation and bud formation, are proposed to explain its lagged impact on canopy photosynthetic capacity. Other causes of NEP inter-annual variability are the radiation during the current vegetation season and the temperature at the end of the winter but the latter variable rather indicates an effect on the conifers interspersed in the plot. Overall, the photosynthetic capacity combined with these two factors explained about 75% of NEP inter-annual variability.","","article","","262","","","Inter-annual variability of Net Ecosystem Productivity for a temperate mixed forest: A predominance of carry-over effects?","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318302442","0168-1923","2018","340-353","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

To determine contributions from these interactions, we used space-borne remotely sensed vegetation indices to monitor leaf development across climate gradients and ecoregions in the southeastern United States. We quantified how air temperature, drought severity, and canopy thermal stress contribute to changes in leaf flushing from mountainous to coastal plain regions by developing a hierarchical state-space Bayesian model. We synthesized daily field climate data with daily vegetation indices and canopy surface temperature during spring green-up season at 59 sites in the southeastern United States between 2001 and 2012. Our results demonstrated strong interaction effects between ecosystem properties and climate variables across ecoregions. We found spring green-up is faster in the mountains, while coastal forests express a larger sensitivity to inter-annual temperature anomalies. Despite our detection of a decreasing trend in sensitivity to warming with temperature in all regions, we identified an ecosystem interaction: Deciduous dominated forests are less sensitive to warming than are those with fewer deciduous trees, likely due to the continuous presence of leaves in evergreen species throughout the season. Mountainous forest green-up is more susceptible to intensifying drought and moisture deficit, while coastal areas are relatively resilient. We found that with increasing canopy thermal stress, defined as canopy-air temperature difference, leaf development slows following dry years, and accelerates following wet years.","","article","","209","","","Leaf phenology paradox: Why warming matters most where it is already warm","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718300713","0034-4257","2018","446-455","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Indicators of traffic risk aim to capture the passage to unsafe states. However, research in other industries has shown that it is meaningful to analyse safety along the whole spectrum of behaviours. Knowing the causes and patterns of “successful” interactions, rather than failures, could give new insights on the complexity of the system and the adaptability and resilience of its users in handling the inherent risks. The concept is known as Safety-II and has been extensively explored in the aviation, healthcare and process engineering domains. In this paper, we explore a new Safety-II paradigm for road safety research. We briefly review Safety-II applications in other sectors. We then present a Safety-II model for road safety, by means of an inverse version of Hyden’s “safety pyramid”. Furthermore, we discuss a number of key road safety goals, theories, analysis methods and data sources and map them into a tentative taxonomy of Safety-I and Safety-II applications.

It has attracted great attention from academia recently and has been broadly applied in solving various problems in different fields. The voyage destination report is a piece of information recorded in AIS that indicates the heading port in a ship’s voyage. This information is widely referred to by port operators for traffic estimation, and by shipping traders for supply forecasting, etc. However, we find that a considerable proportion (nearly 40%) of this information has been erroneously entered, both intentionally and unintentionally. In this paper, we aim to propose targeted policies to correct the inaccurate reports based on assessing the probability of observing wrong destination port reports of ships in AIS. To this end, we first of all conduct extensive interviews with relevant shipping stakeholders to understand the reasons behind the wrong destination reports. Second, based on the interviews and relevant literature we propose the influence factors. Third, we generate a data sample set based on the voyages performed by Capesize and Panamax bulk ships around the globe in a year. To generate this sample set, we leverage data mining techniques to extract the information from an AIS database and other databases. Finally, a discrete choice model is built to achieve the proposed objective. The results demonstrate that our model has an 84.1% accuracy rate in ascertaining the correctness of destination reports observed in AIS. We also find that, for a voyage, the speed of the ship, the historical accuracy rate of destination reports made by the ship, and the distance between the recognized origin and the reported destination of the voyage, have the most significant impacts on the accuracy of the destination report. Based on the findings, we provide managerial and policy suggestions to ship operators, port authorities, and regulators.","","article","","149","","","Can we trust the AIS destination port information for bulk ships?–Implications for shipping policy and practice","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136655452100082X","1366-5545","2021","102308","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review"

Lightning activities in different sea regions and over different peninsular regions are also compared with each other. The values of flash rate over peninsular regions (PI and IP) are 2.6 to 33 times of those over sea regions (AS, BB, CS). Although this contrast is seen throughout the year it is more dominant in the premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. Seasonal variations of the monthly-averaged values of the average flash rate are semiannual in all regions with one maximum in April/May and another in October. The two peaks in semiannual variations are attributed to the variation in surface air temperature. In addition, the October peak may have some contribution from the unstable thermodynamic conditions during the withdrawal phase of the summer monsoon. The annual flash rate shows an increasing trend of 1.1 to 1.2 times increase in both land and sea regions in South Asia but no significant change in the regions in Southeast Asia during the 1995–2005 period. The monthly-averaged flash rates are positively correlated with the average surface temperature and convective available potential energy (CAPE) and negatively correlated with the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), with higher correlation coefficients over peninsular regions than over the sea regions. The flashes over peninsular regions, though more frequent, are likely to be less energetic and have only 0.4 to 0.9 of the radiance that is found over the sea regions. The lowest flash rate in the AS region can be attributed to the dominance of more maritime conditions with shallower clouds in monsoon season in this region.","","article","","118","","","Land–sea contrast in lightning activity over the sea and peninsular regions of South/Southeast Asia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809512001676","0169-8095","2012","52-67","Atmospheric Research"

We automatically map 14,329 glaciers (30,063 km2) in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, from 1984 to 2020 using satellite image archives from the Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 missions and reveal an acceleration in area loss that commenced in 2011. Glacier fragmentation, disappearance, and proglacial lake development also accelerated, as did the retreat of glaciers to higher elevations. Our annually-resolved method relies on the existence of previously published and manually validated glacier inventories from the mid-1980s and mid-2000's. Our methods performed well for clean ice glaciers, had occasional errors when proglacial lakes were present, and consistently underestimated the area of debris-covered glaciers. Clean ice glacier area loss accelerated sevenfold between the early [1984–2010] and late [2011−2020] epochs. This acceleration yielded rates of area shrinkage of −49 ± 7 km2 a−1 [early] and − 340 ± 40 km2 a−1 [late] with accelerated losses (32-fold increase) for small glaciers on Vancouver Island over the last decade. Glacier fragmentation accelerated from 26 ± 5.6 fragments a−1 to 88 ± 39 fragments a−1. About 1141 glaciers fell below our 0.05 km2 detection limit and so disappeared from our database, representing a loss of 8%. Proglacial lake area growth accelerated from 9.2 ± 1.1 km2 a−1 to 49 ± 4.5 km2 a−1. We also observed an acceleration in the upwards migration of median glacier elevations for clean ice glaciers from 0.31 ± 0.08 m a−1 to 4.7 ± 0.7 m a−1.

The spatial and seasonal variability of DCS occurrence have been investigated, as well as the most favourable synoptic precursors for their initiation. The analysis has shown the existence of some preferential areas of DCS genesis, mainly located in the western (i.e., around Balearic Islands) and central (i.e., Ionic and Tyrrhenian seas) Mediterranean, where these systems develop and grow preferentially in fall (i.e., September and October). The analysis of a selected set of Synoptic Precursors (SPs) has shown how the totality of the identified cases has occurred downstream a mid-tropospheric (500hPa) disturbance (trough or cut-off) within a southerly flow, with high values of θe (at 850hPa) and precipitable water. Moreover, the approaching of an upper level tropopause dynamical anomaly coupled with a local maximum of upper and low level horizontal wind speed, seems to play a very important role in triggering convection. Finally, a careful crosscheck of the detected cases with the ESWD reports has allowed to investigate the severity of these systems, as they often affect population and produce significant damages. This study has to be considered a necessary step towards the development of a larger climatologic database of long-lasting, deep convective events occurring in the Mediterranean sea, as well as the definition of a specific conceptual model based on synoptic precursors, having the long-term issue of setting up an objective procedure to support regional meteorological services in early decisions and accurate nowcasting.","","article","","123","","","A four year (2007–2010) analysis of long-lasting deep convective systems in the Mediterranean basin","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809512003055","0169-8095","2013","151-166","Atmospheric Research"

However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike.

The software has two modes of operation, Planning Mode and Execution Mode. In Planning Mode an operator can readily simulate a desired flight plan to determine mission feasibility. Key features of this mode include integration of forecast weather data and interactive trajectory planning. Harsh North Atlantic weather can jeopardize a mission, so running a simulation with predicted wind conditions may greatly reduce the risk of a UAV loss. In Execution Mode the operator can deploy an autonomous vehicle, change the route “on the fly”, hold the aircraft over a point of interest, and return the UAV to home base whenever necessary. In both modes the predicted and actual weather conditions are the key to mission success. All weather data required for these functions is automatically downloaded via the internet. Operation of the software, including interactive trajectory planning, weather observation, mission planning and execution, is achieved through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Simulation results, flight trajectories, and weather data can be saved for further analysis. Comparing missions with and without weather information, it was determined that meteorological information can have a very significant impact on the mission success or failure.

In order to improve the clustering performance of ship trajectory data, which is characterized by a large data volume and distribution complexity, a method consisting of Douglas-Peucker (DP)-based compression and density-based clustering is proposed. In the first part of the proposed method, the appropriate parameters for the DP algorithm were determined according to the shape changes in the trajectories, which were used to compress the trajectories prior to calculating the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance matrix. In the second part, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was improved in terms of determining the parameters. Based on the statistical characteristics of ship trajectory distribution, the appropriate DBSCAN parameters could be determined adaptively. Evaluation and comparison experiments were conducted based on massive real ship trajectories in the Chinese port of Beilun-Zhoushan.

Aerosols are co-emitted with CO from both fires and anthropogenic sources but with a shorter lifetime than CO. A combined trend analysis of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from space helps to diagnose the drivers of regional differences in the CO trend. We use the long-term records of CO from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. Other satellite instruments measuring CO in the thermal infrared, AIRS, TES, IASI, and CrIS, show consistent hemispheric CO variability and corroborate results from the trend analysis performed with MOPITT CO. Trends are examined by hemisphere and in regions for 2002 to 2018, with uncertainties quantified. The CO and AOD records are split into two sub-periods (2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2018) in order to assess trend changes over the 16 years. We focus on four major population centers: Northeast China, North India, Europe, and Eastern USA, as well as fire-prone regions in both hemispheres. In general, CO declines faster in the first half of the record compared to the second half, while AOD trends show more variability across regions. We find evidence of the atmospheric impact of air quality management policies. The large decline in CO found over Northeast China is initially associated with an improvement in combustion efficiency, with subsequent additional air quality improvements from 2010 onwards. Industrial regions with minimal emission control measures such as North India become more globally relevant as the global CO trend weakens. We also examine the CO trends in monthly percentile values to understand seasonal implications and find that local changes in biomass burning are sufficiently strong to counteract the global downward trend in atmospheric CO, particularly in late summer.","","article","","256","","","Air pollution trends measured from Terra: CO and AOD over industrial, fire-prone, and background regions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720306489","0034-4257","2021","112275","Remote Sensing of Environment"

This research provides the first assessment in Ireland of the frequency, duration, intensity and geographical distribution of the daily extreme air temperature indices recommended by the ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) and based on long-term rescued, quality-controlled and homogenised data. Prior analysis of air temperature indices in Ireland had focused on the period since the second half of the 20th century, where digital data were readily available. Earlier estimations of long-term air temperature trends in Ireland focused on non-homogenised data from a small network of stations. For this research, 11 long-term (1885–2018) maximum and minimum air temperature series were analysed to assess seasonal and annual trends and construct extreme air temperature indices in Ireland. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was employed to test the statistical significance of the maximum and minimum air temperatures and indices trends (p < 0.05). Significant increasing trends were assessed in the seasonal and annual maximum and minimum air temperature series in Ireland, with greater increases in the spring and autumn seasons. Significant increasing trends were determined in the warm days (+6.8 days), warm nights (+7.5 nights), warm spell duration index (+3.9 days), growing season length (+22 days), coldest night (+2.7 °C) and coldest day (+1.5 °C) in the period 1885–2018 in Ireland. In the same period, significant decreasing trends were identified in the cold days (−9.3 days), cold nights (−7 nights), frost days (−13.7 days), cold spell duration index (−6.9 days) and diurnal air temperature range (−0.1 °C) in Ireland. The results follow global patterns presented in the Six Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The findings of this research will be crucial to assist stakeholders and policymakers in defining climate action, adaptation and mitigation plans in response to shifting trends in air temperature extremes.","","article","","36","","","Long-term trends in daily extreme air temperature indices in Ireland from 1885 to 2018","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094722000469","2212-0947","2022","100464","Weather and Climate Extremes"

Evidence of past mining contamination was obtained from the XRF analyses of iron, copper, zinc and lead. These results were analytically and statistically processed to produce a metal content index. Positive metal anomalies indicate four major pulses of contamination coinciding with the end of the Iron Age, from the end of the Roman Period to the Early Medieval Period, the Late Medieval Period, and the Modern Period. These pulses show good agreement with local historical sources of mining in the Hasli-Aare catchment, dating back to the beginning of the 15th century. Furthermore, they are in phase with anthropogenic pollution trends inferred from glacier ice cores, lake sediments and peat bogs across the Western Alps, most notably during the Roman, Late Medieval and Modern Periods. However, close comparison between these records can show some differences, suggesting local variations in mining activities and/or a lag in metal transfer.

Nonetheless, this regional sea supports a high diversity of species and habitats, whose functioning provides a variety of ecosystem services, essential for human welfare. In 2017, OSPAR, the Northeast Atlantic Regional Seas Commission, delivered an assessment of marine biodiversity for the Northeast Atlantic. This assessment examined biodiversity indicators separately to identify changes in Northeast Atlantic biodiversity, but stopped short of determining the status of biodiversity for many species and habitats. Here, we expand on this work and for the first time, a semi-quantitative approach is applied to evaluate holistically the state of Northeast Atlantic marine biodiversity across marine food webs, from plankton to top predators, via fish, pelagic and benthic habitats, including xeno-biodiversity (i.e. NIS). Our analysis reveals widespread degradation in marine ecosystems and biodiversity, particularly for marine birds and coastal bottlenose dolphins, as well as for benthic habitats and fish in some regions. The poor biodiversity status of these ecosystem components is likely the result of cumulative effects of human activities, such as habitat destruction or disturbance, overexploitation, eutrophication, the introduction of NIS, and climate change. Bright spots are also revealed, such as recent signs of recovery in some fish and marine bird communities and recovery in harbour and grey seal populations and the condition of coastal benthic communities in some regions. The status of many indicators across all ecosystem components, but particularly for the novel pelagic habitats, food webs and NIS indicators, however, remains uncertain due to gaps in data, unclear pressure-state relationships, and the non-linear influence of some pressures on biodiversity indicators. Improving monitoring and data access and increasing understanding of pressure-state relationships, including those that are non-linear, is therefore a priority for enabling future assessments, as is consistent and stable resourcing for expert involvement.","","article","","141","","","Assessing the state of marine biodiversity in the Northeast Atlantic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22006203","1470-160X","2022","109148","Ecological Indicators"

The research of the Hepu Han Tombs can offer opportunities to understand the burial customs and the Han culture in the Chinese Han Dynasty. With the aim of detecting the location, depth and geometry of two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey was performed in cooperation with archaeological team to calibrate the results with detailed information from the limited drillings in the area. Besides, series of 2-D ERT sections, acquired above the larger mound, were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, and iso-resistivity surfaces were further calculated to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, expected towards a more detailed and quantitative interpretation. Both the 2-D and 3-D resistivity imaging gave a clear evidence of structural details of the burial mounds.

Second, joint probability density functions for speed over ground (SOG) and course over ground (COG) are built taking into account the combined influences of motion characteristics, which are beneficial for determining the ship traffic rules in manoeuvring hot zones and utilized in marine management.

The results suggest that the annual number of summer and tropical days was generally below the long-term average through to the end of the 1980s. In particular, positive anomaly values could be observed at all stations between the years 1993–2014. With respect to the Kruskal-Wallis homogeneity test, the significant breaking date was 1993. The rapid rise of the annual number of summer (tropical) days after this year led to the inversion of the negative trends observed from 1987 to 1992 into positive ones. The increasing trend is statistically significance at 0.01 level in Yumurtalık, Mersin and Antakya for the annual number of summer and tropical days. Dörtyol, İskenderun and Elbistan were significance at 0.01 level for tropical days. The largest positive anomalies of the summer of 2010 are observed in coastal vicinity (Mersin, Yumurtalık and İskenderun). This indicates that these settlements underwent a long-term warm period and thermal conditions due to increasing temperatures in the spring and summer months. The same conditions are found in high inner areas (Göksun and Elbistan) for tropical days. It is noticed that a tendency for greater warming occurred at stations located above 1000m in the sub-region. The average number of warm days will increase 2-days per 100-years in southern part of the sub-region.

The Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System, in its original specification, is used to test this hypothesis. The empirical analysis, supported by Granger-causality tests, shows that the annual mass change anomaly of the ice cap is a statistically and economically significant determinant of consumption of non-durable goods in Greenland.

Here, we use 106 wood anatomical thin sections from 23 forest sites and 20 tree species in both hemispheres to search for cell-level fingerprints of ephemeral summer cooling between 530 and 550 CE.

It also captured relevant data for hypothesis generation for further outbreak investigations, integrating a global view of the health and disturbance of the coastal marine ecosystem. However, to be effective and sustainable, this flexible approach requires a pre-existing knowledge of the structure of the information network of the farmers’ community. Such a community-based enhanced surveillance could increase the reactivity of the entire system to enable the earliest possible and most appropriate interventions to protect shellfish populations against exotic or emerging infectious diseases. This would also help to improve the vigilance of mussel farmers and foster their commitment, which is an essential element for sustainable shellfish health surveillance.","","article","","132","","","Enhanced surveillance of shellfish mortality to improve early detection and investigation of outbreaks of exotic or emerging infectious diseases: An example of a mass mortality outbreak of mussels, France 2014","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587716302884","0167-5877","2016","57-66","Preventive Veterinary Medicine"

ICS was designed to be used in an isolated area or connected to other systems via specialised communication mechanisms or protocols. This setup allows manufacturers to manage their production processes with great flexibility and safety. However, this design does not meet today’s business requirements to work with state-of-the-art technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and big data analytics. In order to fulfil industry requirements, many ICSs have been connected to enterprise networks that allow business users to access real-time data generated by power plants. At the same time, this new design opens up several cybersecurity challenges for ICSs. We review possible cyber attacks on ICSs, identify typical threats and vulnerabilities, and we discuss unresolved security issues with existing ICS cybersecurity solutions. Then, we discuss how to secure ICSs (e.g., using risk assessment methodologies) and other protection measures. We also identify open security research challenges for ICSs, and we present a classification of existing security solutions along with their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide future research directions in ICS security.","","article","","165","","","Cybersecurity in industrial control systems: Issues, technologies, and challenges","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128619306292","1389-1286","2019","106946","Computer Networks"

This study addresses this question by combining a unique data set consisting of policy documents from the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) with data measuring ecosystem change in the Baltic Sea during the period 1980–2013. Here HELCOM's responses to two types of ecosystem changes are investigated: fast and visible (summer algae blooms) and slow and opaque (anoxic areas). Finally, this study assesses if the organizational reform of 2007, which introduced the ecosystem approach, has had any effects on HELCOM responsiveness. It is found that HELCOM, contrary to expectations, is only responding systematically to slow-moving and opaque processes but that this response confirms the anticipated organizational bottom-up pattern. The ecosystem approach reform seems to have had a negative effect on the responsiveness of HELCOM; however, a general trend is that HELCOM over time has become more responsive in the lower levels of the organization. The lack of an immediate effect regarding the ecosystem approach reform can serve as a reminder of the absence of panaceas in policy making in general, and in environmental governance in particular.","","article","","70","","","Organizational responsiveness: The case of unfolding crises and problem detection within HELCOM","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X16301889","0308-597X","2016","49-57","Marine Policy"

Thirty-eight satellite scenes (ERS SAR), taken from May 1992 to January 2001, were analysed for detecting more than 2million PS on the study area. Continuous velocity surface maps (Iso-Kinematic Maps: IKM) were obtained from geo-statistical and spatial cluster techniques (Hot Spot analysis) of PS “short-period” data, to identify relative ground motions and to compare them with “long-period” tectonic mobility trends, i.e. those inferred at regional scale over geological times (some million years). The comparison was made by individuation of homogeneous kinematic areas, represented in the IKM, and characterization of the boundaries between them (Iso-Kinematic Boundaries: IKB). The IKB were used as tools to asses if the PS-InSAR data on present-day crustal mobility could fit with the distribution of real tectonic structures or field geological elements. IKM were drawn for uplifting geological sectors of Piemonte (Maritime Alps, Gran Paradiso, Langhe) where moderate to very low seismicity is recorded, and gravitational instabilities of rock mass on mountain slopes are widespread. The land sectors have been chosen in order to test the suitability of IKM in very different geo-morphological conditions. Different types of correspondence between the IKM and the geological kinematic trend were found:-a first type in which the kinematic trend of short-period (a decade of years, i.e. the PS-InSAR detection time span) is in agreement with a long-period tectonic trend (some million years) and seem to be driven by well known faults subparallel to the IKB. These kinematic trends can be hidden by the slope movement due to gravitational instabilities;-a second type in which the kinematic trend of short-period does not strictly correspond to the long-period trend, but can be considered as minor-order, uplifting-subsidence cycles, even if in contrast with the long-period kinematic trend. Alternatively, the short-period kinematic trends could reflect the action of deep-seated geological forces or structures, not yet known or inferable (at least with the recorded PS-InSAR velocities) on the basis of the available geological data and models.","","article","","115","","","Iso-Kinematic Maps from statistical analysis of PS-InSAR data of Piemonte, NW Italy: Comparison with geological kinematic trends","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425711000162","0034-4257","2011","1188-1201","Remote Sensing of Environment"

This fault is characterized by its juxtaposition of pre-Tertiary andesitic basalt (Playa Venado Formation) against late Oligocene Tertiary sediments (Caimito Formation). In this zone, four 2D electrical resistivity tomography profiles were conducted perpendicular to the fault trace: T-1, T-2, T-3 and T-4. The T-1, T-3, and T-4 profiles were long profiles (235m for the first two and 215m for the last one), with a goal of determining the depth of the geologic boundary between the sedimentary and andesitic deposits. The T-2 profile was a short profile (23.5m), with the objective of calibrating the results with data provided by the paleoseismic trenching previously developed in the area of interest. For these tests, two electrode arrays of types Wenner-Schlumberger and Dipole-Dipole, were used. For the inversion routine, two regularized least-squares methods were used: the smoothness-constrained method and robust inversion. The long electrical resistivity tomography profiles were able to identify a set of electrical anomalies associated with the andesitic basalt and the Tertiary sediments and with that, the contact geometry between these formations. In these profiles, fault angle measurements ranged from 60° to 80° with respect to the ground surface. In the T-2 profile, the electrical anomalies showed a good association with the results of the paleoseismic study. This allowed identification of the colluvium and alluvium covering the gravel and sand debris that mark the gradual transition to the soils of the Caimito Formation. Finally, a set of 2D synthetic models was developed for each of the T-1, T-3, and T-4 profiles with the objective of optimizing interpretation of the field results.","","article","","138","","","Shallow electrical resistivity imaging of the Limón fault, Chagres River Watershed, Panama Canal","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117300320","0926-9851","2017","135-142","Journal of Applied Geophysics"

Publicly available satellite imagery can now provide such time series. However, satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) are associated with uncertainties, particularly at high-energy meso-macrotidal coasts, which challenge the assessment of long-term trends and interannual variability. In this paper we address the 1984–2020 time- and space-evolution of 269 km of high-energy meso-macrotidal sandy coast in southwest France using uncertain (no tide and runup correction) SDS data. The shoreline trends are validated with field data collected over the period 2008–2019. Over 1984–2020, the shoreline eroded by 0.55 m/yr with maximum erosion (accretion) reaching 15.61 m/yr (6.94 m/yr), with the largest changes observed along coasts adjacent to the inlet and estuary mouths. We show that, away from the presence of ebb-tide deltas and swash bars affecting offshore wave transformation and nearshore circulation, the long-term shoreline trend is well explained by the gradients in longshore drift computed from a regional wave hindcast and an empirical longshore transport formula. By averaging the yearly SDS along the entire coastline, we find that interannual shoreline variability is well correlated with the winter West Europe Pressure Anomaly (WEPA), which outscores the other conventional teleconnection pattern indices. WEPA even explains >80 % of the space-averaged shoreline variability over the recent period 2014–2020 when more and higher quality satellite images are available. A more local assessment of the links between climate indices and shoreline response shows that correlation with all climate indices dramatically drops downdrift of the large-scale estuary mouths and inlets. This suggests that along this 10–20 km stretch of downdrift coast, shoreline response is controlled factors internal to the estuary mouth/inlet system. The rest of the coast is mostly controlled by factors external to the system, which are primarily the variability in winter-mean wave height correlated to winter WEPA index. Overall, we demonstrate that an adapted space-averaging of uncorrected (noisy) SDS dataset can allow addressing the time- and space variability of shoreline change and their primary drivers including large-scale climate patterns of atmospheric variability. We also advocate that such SDS analysis can be performed along any coastline in the world in order to guide future model development and application.","","article","","413","","","Primary drivers of multidecadal spatial and temporal patterns of shoreline change derived from optical satellite imagery","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X22002537","0169-555X","2022","108360","Geomorphology"

Reference populations in these studies have never been characterized to determine whether genetic differences might explain some of the effects seen in gulls at contaminated locations. Previously it was shown that there were higher rates of germline minisatellite DNA mutation rates in herring gulls colonizing sites located near steel industries in urban areas in the Great Lakes. It was suggested that population substructuring among gull colonies could account for differences in the mutation rates observed as a result of surveying different minisatellite loci. Here this explanation is dismissed by showing that genetic exchange among herring gull populations within the Great Lakes appears to be sufficient to ensure genetic homogeneity of these populations; in contrast, differences exist at the minisatellite loci scored between the gulls in the Great Lakes and the Maritimes. It is suggested that reference samples for future Great Lakes herring gull studies be selected from within the Great Lakes, and that potential genetic divergence from Maritime gulls should be investigated in more detail.","","article","","25","","","Genetic Structure Among Breeding Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) from the Great Lakes and Eastern Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133099707835","0380-1330","1999","856-864","Journal of Great Lakes Research"

Most of these structures store and transport water masses including associated physical and biological properties throughout the entire basin. In order to study the evolution of a long-life anticyclonic eddy, we use a multiplatform approach based on remote sensing data analysis and in situ measurements. We present a case study of an anticyclonic eddy that persisted for 17 months within the basin. The feature was identified through a hybrid method of eddy detection and tracking applied to altimetry data, and sampled twice during two different oceanographic cruises in autumn 2004 and late spring 2005. Transect observations of potential temperature, salinity, density and the dissolved oxygen concentration were utilised to infer water mass properties and eddy characteristics. In situ data show that water of Atlantic origin, initially trapped by the eddy during its formation, was modified during the eddy lifetime. The time evolution of radius, kinetic energy and vorticity suggests dividing the eddy lifetime into three phases: the eddy formation, an intermediate period of high variability and a final, lower energy phase. The track followed by the eddy confirms the hypothesis of an interaction with the North Balearic Front and a consequent change of the eddy's physical properties. Decomposing the eddy's kinetic energy into mean and fluctuating terms allows us to describe its interaction with the mean circulation of the basin. In particular during formation, the southern part of the eddy absorbs energy from the mean circulation, while it provides energy to the mean flow in its northern part. In the second phase, when the eddy is far from the coast, it receives energy from the mean flow. Combining in situ data analysis with the results of the satellite-imagery-based detection and tracking method has proven to be a very useful method in assessing the evolution of a mesoscale structure in the Algerian Basin and its interaction with the large scale ocean dynamics of the Western Mediterranean Sea.","","article","","207","","","Life history of an anticyclonic eddy in the Algerian basin from altimetry data, tracking algorithm and in situ observations.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796320300427","0924-7963","2020","103346","Journal of Marine Systems"

Unanswered questions from this body of work are: 1) how variable are carbon fluxes on a year to year basis?; 2) what are the biophysical factors that may cause interannual variability and/or temporal trends in carbon fluxes?; and 3) how does the biophysical control on this carbon flux variability differ by climate and ecological spaces? To address these questions, we surveyed published data from 59 sites that reported on five or more years of continuous measurements, yielding 544 site-years of data. We found that the standard deviation of the interannual variability in net ecosystem carbon exchange (162gCm−2y−1) is large relative to its population mean (−200gCm−2 y−1). Broad-leaved evergreen forests and crops experienced the greatest absolute variability in interannual net carbon exchange (greater than ±300gCm−2y−1) and boreal evergreen forests and maritime wetlands were among the least variable (less than  ±40 gCm−2y−1). A disproportionate fraction of the yearly variability in net ecosystem exchange was associated with biophysical factors that modulated ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. Yet, there was appreciable and statistically significant covariance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Consequently, biophysical conditions that conspired to increase ecosystem photosynthesis to from one year to the next were associated with an increase in ecosystem respiration, and vice versa; on average, the year to year change in respiration was 40% as large as the year to year change in photosynthesis. The analysis also identified sets of ecosystems that are on the verge of switching from being carbon sinks to carbon sources. These include sites in the Arctic tundra, the evergreen forests in the Pacific northwest and some grasslands, where year to year changes in respiration are outpacing those in photosynthesis. While a select set of climatic and ecological factors (e.g. light, rainfall, temperature, phenology) played direct and indirect roles on this variability, their impact differed conditionally, as well as by climate and ecological spaces. For example, rainfall had both positive and negative effects. Deficient rainfall caused a physiological decline in photosynthesis in temperate and semi-arid regions. Too much rain, in the humid tropics, limited photosynthesis by limiting light. In peatlands and tundra, excess precipitation limited ecosystem respiration when it raised the water table to the surface. For deciduous forests, warmer temperatures lengthened the growing season, increasing photosynthesis, but this effect also increased soil respiration. Finally, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the detection limit of trends; we computed the confidence intervals of trends in multi-year carbon fluxes that need to be resolved to conclude whether the differences are to be attributed to randomness or biophysical forcings. Future studies and reports on interannual variations need to consider the role of the duration of the time series on random errors when quantifying potential trends and extreme events.","","article","","249","","","Inter-annual variability of net and gross ecosystem carbon fluxes: A review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192317301806","0168-1923","2018","520-533","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

Theoretical analysis indicates that magnetic field in each orthogonal direction Bi (i = x, y, z) is found to be a superposition of its three basic elements Bij (i = x, y, z and j = 1, 2, 3) along certain direction, allowing the obtained dipole signature to be decomposed of 9 basic elements. An orthogonal energy ratio (OER) algorithm is used to infer the MMO by calculating the signal energy distribution along each axis. A standard OER database is developed which provides a reference to be compared with the measured OER. The one having the smallest variance is determined as the estimated MMO. Owing to space symmetric property, it generally introduces 8 possible solutions. Then, a mathematic method is presented to define the common characteristics of the magnetic signature in the 8 octants, which is able to identify the octant of unknown target based on detected Bi field. As a result, the unique MMO can be estimated. The experimental results show good estimation accuracy for the dipole orientation with average error of 3.5°. In particular, the algorithm is independent of changing CPA and velocity, which is demonstrated in simulation and experiment.","","article","","505","","","Estimation of dipole magnetic moment orientation based on magnetic signature waveform analysis by a magnetic sensor","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030488531933999X","0304-8853","2020","166761","Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials"

Because of their opportunistic nature however, strandings data have long been under- or misused in the assessment of population conservation status. Even if many national and international regulations promote the use of strandings in monitoring strategies, the interpretation of strandings remains controversial. The aim of this study is to provide a context for the interpretation of marine megafauna stranding data, in order to assess the achievement of specific objectives against Good Environmental Status criteria in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive or other regional agreements. The first step is to construct an a priori spatial distribution under a null hypothesis H0. The a priori spatial distribution of theoretical dead animals can either be set uniformly, consistent with current knowledge on abundance of marine vertebrates, or based on management objectives. The drift prediction of these theoretical carcasses would provide a time series of strandings expected under the null hypothesis. The reverse drift of observed strandings would highlight mortality areas of stranded animals. The correction of these areas by the probability of getting stranded according to drift conditions would provide an estimated distribution of dead animals inferred from strandings. The differences between expected and observed situations constitute anomalies and highlight cases where inferred distribution departs from the a priori spatial distribution. This work proposes several population indicators that can be used anywhere in the world and can be applied for all large marine vertebrates found stranded. The integration of these indicators in MSFD and various regional agreements could provide cost-effective and relevant information on protected species. In the context of impaired ecological situations, the complementary use of several population indicators could strengthen the diagnosis made regarding conservation status and hence conservation strategies.","","article","","54","","","Marine megavertebrates adrift: A framework for the interpretation of stranding data in perspective of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive and other regional agreements","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901115300393","1462-9011","2015","240-247","Environmental Science & Policy"

Comparison between REEs in water, partial extraction and total sediment analyses indicates that REEs+Y in the stream sediments have two primary sources, the host lithologies (i.e., mechanical dispersion) and hydromorphically transported (the labile fraction). Furthermore, Eu appears to be more mobile than the other REE, whereas Ce is preferentially removed from solution and accumulates in the stream sediments in a less labile form than the other REEs+Y. Despite poor statistical correlations between the REEs+Y and Mn in either the total sediment or partial extractions, based on apparent distribution coefficients and the pH of the stream waters, we suggest that either sediment organic matter and/or possibly δ-MnO2/FeOOH are likely the predominant sinks for Ce, and to a lesser extent the other REE, in the stream sediments.","","article","","72","","","Rare earth elements (REE) and yttrium in stream waters, stream sediments, and Fe–Mn oxyhydroxides: Fractionation, speciation, and controls over REE+Y patterns in the surface environment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703708005620","0016-7037","2008","5962-5983","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

These hegemonic cycles are highly correlated with, or underpinned by, maritime and commercial dominance. Some aspects of long cycle theory have been contested by the rival “world systems” theory, that has fewer cycles and a disinclination to separate the military and economic dimensions of hegemony. Heretofore, naval power, as reflected in capital ship construction and orders of battle, has been used to measure maritime dominance. This research suggests that data for rival and successive global basing access networks could be used to inform and query the basis of long cycle theory; i.e., to provide a measure of “global reach”. There are additionally, interesting conceptual questions about the basis for basing access, as it has evolved historically; specifically, from a basis in conquest to one dependent upon diplomacy and various quid pro quo. The article suggests the need for more historical data collection on bases.","","article","","18","","","Long cycle theory and the hegemonic powers' basing networks","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629899000335","0962-6298","1999","941-972","Political Geography"

Currently, the methods used to diagnose COVID-19 have several limitations, thus new techniques need to be investigated to improve the diagnosis and overcome these limitations. Taking into consideration the great benefits of electrocardiogram (ECG) applications, this paper proposes a new pipeline called ECG-BiCoNet to investigate the potential of using ECG data for diagnosing COVID-19. ECG-BiCoNet employs five deep learning models of distinct structural design. ECG-BiCoNet extracts two levels of features from two different layers of each deep learning technique. Features mined from higher layers are fused using discrete wavelet transform and then integrated with lower-layers features. Afterward, a feature selection approach is utilized. Finally, an ensemble classification system is built to merge predictions of three machine learning classifiers. ECG-BiCoNet accomplishes two classification categories, binary and multiclass. The results of ECG-BiCoNet present a promising COVID-19 performance with an accuracy of 98.8% and 91.73% for binary and multiclass classification categories. These results verify that ECG data may be used to diagnose COVID-19 which can help clinicians in the automatic diagnosis and overcome limitations of manual diagnosis.","","article","","142","","","ECG-BiCoNet: An ECG-based pipeline for COVID-19 diagnosis using Bi-Layers of deep features integration","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482522000026","0010-4825","2022","105210","Computers in Biology and Medicine"

Remote sensing satellite imagery has high potential to provide a solution to overcome the difficulties and limitations associated with geological field mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions. In this study, the applications of Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were investigated to extract geological information for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions. The north-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected in this study to conduct a satellite-based remote sensing mapping approach. A two-stage methodology was adopted to distinguish pixel and sub-pixel targets in the satellite images. In the first stage, Continuum Removal (CR) spectral mapping tool and Independent Components Analysis (ICA) technique were applied to Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral bands to map the pixels related to poorly exposed lithological units. The second step was established based on the application of target detection algorithms to shortwave infrared bands of ASTER for detecting spectral features attributed to alteration mineral assemblages at the sub-pixel level. Pixels composed of distinctive absorption features of alteration mineral assemblages and Si-O bond emission minima features were detected by applying CR mapping tool to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. Anomaly pixels related to spectral features of Al-O–H, Fe, Mg-O–H and CO3 groups as well as lithological attributions from felsic to mafic rocks were detected by the implementation of ICA technique to reflective and thermal bands of Landsat-8 and ASTER. ICA method provided image maps of alteration mineral assemblages and lithological units (mafic to felsic trend) for poorly mapped and/or unmapped regions. Fractional abundance of alteration minerals such as muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, epidote, chlorite and biotite were detected in poorly exposed lithologies using target detection algorithms. Several prospecting areas for Cu, Mo, Au and Ag mineralization related to propyllitically and argillically altered units of Andean Intrusive Suite (AIS) were identified in the southern sector of the study region. The results of this investigation demonstrated the applicability of Landsat-8 and ASTER spectral data for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions, particularly using the image processing algorithms that are capable of detecting anomaly pixels and sub-pixel targets in the remotely sensed images, where no prior information is available. In conclusion, a simple and robust satellite-based remote sensing approach for mapping poorly exposed lithologies in inaccessible regions was established, which is comprehensively applicable for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in the Antarctic environments and hydrothermal ore minerals prospecting in other inaccessible regions around the world.","","article","","108","","","Lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies using Landsat-8 and ASTER satellite data: North-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016913681730015X","0169-1368","2019","112-133","Ore Geology Reviews"

Five events were considered, during which eruptions from eight volcanoes injected ash into the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere. For one of the eruptions, at Miyakejima, Japan, at least five aircraft encountered volcanic ash clouds, and the cost to three operators alone exceeded US $12,000,000 in aircraft repairs, diversions, and lost operating time. We performed ‘reverse’ absorption and ‘pattern analysis’ using GMS-5/VISSR, MODIS and AVHRR data, and we examined TOMS SO2 and Aerosol Index data, surface-based observations, pilot reports, and dispersion model output. Our results verify that the introduction of ‘reverse’ absorption using the geostationary GMS-5 platform significantly enhanced our capacity to monitor volcanic ash clouds in the region. In one case, we tracked an eruption cloud for approximately 80 h. The primary impediment to remote monitoring is the presence of overlying cloud, or substantial amounts of ice within the volcanic clouds. TOMS data showed success in identifying volcanic clouds during these conditions, but was limited by the infrequency of observations. More effective future operation of the IAVW relies on developing complementary methods of volcanic cloud remote sensing, and greatly increasing the amount and quality of available surface and air observations, including observations of precursor activity. An understanding of the likely future limitations of remote sensing techniques will aid in the refining of IAVW procedures.","","article","","91","","","An evaluation of volcanic cloud detection techniques during recent significant eruptions in the western ‘Ring of Fire’","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425704000562","0034-4257","2004","27-46","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Edge detection has played an important role in the interpretation of potential-field data. There are many methods that have been proposed to detect and enhance the edges of geological bodies based on horizontal and vertical derivatives of potential-field data. In order to make full use of all the measured gradient components, we need to develop a new edge detector to process the full tensor gravity gradient data. We first define the directional Theta and use the horizontal directional Theta to define a new edge detector. This method was tested on synthetic and real full tensor gravity gradient data to validate its feasibility. Compared the results with other balanced detectors, the new detector can effectively delineate the edges and does not produce any additional false edges.","","article","","130","","","Advantages of horizontal directional Theta method to detect the edges of full tensor gravity gradient data","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116301082","0926-9851","2016","53-61","Journal of Applied Geophysics"

Given the severe implications and huge forecast spread among different models, the extreme Mei-yu has aroused widespread concern. This review synthesizes the latest research on the characteristics and potential climate forcing factors of such extreme Mei-yu and discusses the challenges and outlooks for prediction and numerical modeling. The distinct characteristics of the Yangtze River Valley summer rainfalls in 2020 included record-breaking accumulated precipitation, longest duration, earliest onset, and highest intensity. We summarize the majority of the studies investigating the diverse coupled ocean-atmospheric processes at different timescales. The research consensus is that the anomalous anticyclone spanning the western North Pacific and the mid-high latitude trough-ridge patterns are the two critical circulation features carrying tropical and mid-high latitude signals, jointly affecting the extreme Mei-yu. Potential mechanisms based on the two essential atmospheric circulations during the Mei-yu period are then highlighted. In addition, different climate model simulations are also introduced to reach an inter-model agreement despite certain model biases on the response of atmospheric circulations to these potential forcings among the state-of-the-art atmospheric and coupled general circulation models.

The introduction of Automatic Identification System (AIS), which can record speed over ground (SOG) and course over ground (COG) data, makes these patterns accessible. Based on that, a novel adaptive marine traffic behaviour pattern recognition algorithm is proposed to explore potential traffic behaviour patterns. In the proposed recognition algorithm, multidimensional dynamic time warping is introduced to measure the similarity among trajectories; this process considers both the spatial and motion characteristics of trajectories. However, the computational complexity of multidimensional dynamic time warping is high. To reduce the number of required computations, a data simplification algorithm considering ship behaviours is adopted to compress trajectories and, therefore, to achieve an improved computation ability. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is utilized to classify marine traffic behaviour patterns. Due to the poor adaptation of the DBSCAN algorithm, we design a local mean density to evaluate the trajectory density distribution in the given dataset and then determine the optimal parameters in DBSCAN according to the local mean density gradient to improve the adaptivity of the algorithm. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical experiments involving U.S. east coastal waters. The experimental results indicate that our approach is more accurate and adaptive in terms of recognizing hidden traffic behaviour patterns than other methods","","article","","","","","Adaptive marine traffic behaviour pattern recognition based on multidimensional dynamic time warping and DBSCAN algorithm","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423027318","0957-4174","2023","122229","Expert Systems with Applications"

Notably, existing rumor detection methods simply provide detection labels while ignoring their explanation. However, illustrating the reasons why a suspicious statement is a rumor is essential. To address this realistic scenario, we propose a novel Evidence-Providing Rumor Detection model called EPRD. EPRD incorporates a wide variety of information from both prior knowledge sources and current comments. It also learns bilaterally friendly representations for interpretable rumor detection. EPRD first retrieves evidence from prior knowledge sources and checks the relationship between the given statement and its evidence. Our model then constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the current comments and evidence relationships. Finally, EPRD integrates the GraphSAGE component and attention mechanism to detect rumors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first model that incorporates prior knowledge to verify rumors and boost credibility.

To systematically analyze the research status and development trend of the maritime industry, this paper collects and reviews literature from Elsevier ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases related to green shipping management and green port construction. Future research directions are presented based on the analysis. The results show that green shipping management focus on solving practical emission reduction problems. Most work of green port construction establish mathematical optimization models aiming at minimizing total operation costs or maximizing profits. Designing efficient algorithms is a research hotspot in operation management. By comparing the technical measures, operational strategy, and market-based measures, we found technical innovation is the ultimate way for the maritime industry to realize net zero-emission. Support from governments and organizations is the insurance of green development. Future research perspectives include adopting high-tech technologies such as blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligent to improve operation efficiency and reduce emissions, providing more accurate suggestions for constructing green and smart ports, proposing multi-objective optimization models and highlighting the environmental target.

A subset of determinands: aluminium, calcium, chloride, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon, iron, nitrate, pH, silicon and sulphate are examined within a framework of non-stationary time-series analysis to identify determinand trends, seasonality and short-term dynamics. The results demonstrate that both long-term and high-frequency monitoring provide valuable and unique insights into the hydrochemistry of a catchment. The long-term data allowed analysis of long-term trends, demonstrating continued increases in DOC concentrations accompanied by declining SO4 concentrations within the stream, and provided new insights into the changing amplitude and phase of the seasonality of the determinands such as DOC and Al. Additionally, these data proved invaluable for placing the short-term variability demonstrated within the high-frequency data within context. The 7-hour data highlighted complex diurnal cycles for NO3, Ca and Fe with cycles displaying changes in phase and amplitude on a seasonal basis. The high-frequency data also demonstrated the need to consider the impact that the time of sample collection can have on the summary statistics of the data and also that sampling during the hours of darkness provides additional hydrochemical information for determinands which exhibit pronounced diurnal variability.

The region south of 40°S is usually known as Patagonian Continental Shelf of Argentina (PCSA). The intertidal environments of the Patagonian shore are among the most diverse in South America in terms of their environmental heterogeneity. The productivity distribution over the continental shelf is also heterogeneous and is concentrated on the marine frontal zones. The Patagonian coast is one of the richest and most productive temperate marine ecosystems in the world. The sea near the Patagonian coast is one of the ocean regions in the world in which smaller changes to its physical variables have been observed. There has been a sea-level rise in the region offshore of Patagonia, but the change has been more moderate than the global average. Patagonian coasts of Argentina have only 18 cities, many of them growing rapidly. The population density in this area is below 4 inhabitants/km2. Despite increasing industrial activities in coastal cities in last decades, quality of coastal waters remains high. Argentina has extensive legislation to control marine pollution and protect biodiversity. Despite the advances of the last decades, more efforts are needed for the effective conservation of marine ecosystems on the Patagonian coast.","","incollection","Academic Press","","World Seas: an Environmental Evaluation (Second Edition)","978-0-12-805068-2","Chapter 34 - Southern Argentina: The Patagonian Continental Shelf","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128050682000401","","2019","783-811",""

A system tract analysis of the epicontinental “Normandie Basin”, with pelagic chalks, and of the “Maine Platform” covered by clastics, provides evidence for relative changes in coastal onlap; various minor uncomformities are related to these changes of sea level. The four global cycles (UZA or ZC-2.2/2.5) of Haq et al. (1987, 1988) are recognised while an additional one is proposed for the Geslinianum Zone. In addition, periodic rhythmic cycles are commonly registered within the chalk, expressed by the repitition of various facies enhanced both by biosedimentary processes and diagenetic alteration. These elementary climatic cycles allow accurate lithostratigraphic correlations. During this period when the sea level peaked on the tectonically passive border of the Armorican block, the Paris Basin appears to record a detailed set of events which can be correlated with those in the Atlantic, Boreal and Tethyan provinces.

First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.","","incollection","Elsevier","107","","","Chapter Two - Uncertainty-Wise Testing of Cyber-Physical Systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065245817300189","0065-2458","2017","23-94",""

The average value of twenty-one heat flows now published for the Superior, corrected for Pleistocene glaciation, is 40 ± 8 mW/m2. Heat generation values are low generally less than 3 μWW/m3. Although individual values of the ratio of thorium to uranium vary considerably, the geometrical average of four is lower than results from other Archean rocks. A linear relation between the heat flow and radioactive heat generation may exist. The reduced heat flow, 21 mW/m2, and the characteristic depth, 14 km, from this relation are quite different from other heat flow provinces. Since large thicknesses of the crust have been eroded away and since the original heat generation was much larger than the values measured now, a linear relation equivalent to those found in younger heat flow provinces is not expected. To account for the large differences in heat flow and heat generation observed in different Archean shields an Archean crustal model is proposed which includes thin (2–4 km) radioactive surface veneers over some areas. The thermal parameters of a young crust may well determine whether or not it will survive. Since Archean times the heat flow of each newly stabilized region has been a constant, and since the time of formation or last orogeny the heat flow in each province has steadily decreased. The geothermal gradients in Archean crust have decreased the most, causing significant underplating, and increasing the strength of the crust.","","article","","50","","","Heat flow and heat generation in the superior province of the canadian shield","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195178901993","0040-1951","1978","55-77","Tectonophysics"

These successions represent the onshore equivalents of the `Barren Red Measures' which are important hydrocarbon-bearing sequences in the Southern North Sea. Much is known about the onshore successions in terms of sedimentology, mineralogy and provenance and thus they provide the ideal test for the validity of chemostratigraphy as a stratigraphic tool. Reliable inorganic geochemical data have been acquired from geochemical analyses of core, sidewall core and cuttings samples, with 19 elements being determined. Stratigraphic variations in elemental concentrations are compared with known variations in the mineralogical data. The established lithostratigraphic units of the Duckmantian/Stephanian intervals can also be recognized from the geochemical data and by using these data can be subdivided further. This results in an independent chemostratigraphic correlation being established for the two boreholes, which has been assessed statistically by discriminant function analysis. From the geochemical and mineralogical data, distinct changes in provenance are identified within the Upper Carboniferous successions. The sediments of the Coal Measures were derived from a north westerly and westerly source (?Caledonian), whereas the Etruria Formation sediments came from the Wales Brabant Massif, the sediments having mixed Caledonian and Cadomian characteristics. Eventually these sediments were replaced by sediments from a southern Hercynian source (Halesowen and Salop Formations).","","article","","124","","","Chemostratigraphy: a method to improve interwell correlation in barren sequences — a case study using onshore Duckmantian/Stephanian sequences (West Midlands, U.K.)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037073898001286","0037-0738","1999","197-220","Sedimentary Geology"

In this paper obsidians from these two localities were compared in terms of their aspect, chemical composition, microcrystallinity and microvesiculation. In Sierra de las Navajas, the typical deep green obsidian with a golden hue has been analyzed together with a less common dark grey, porphyritic variety. Lipari obsidian is commonly black, but a light grey variety also occurs. Obsidian of both varieties was analyzed for this paper. Microvesicularity was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation, microporosimetry and, for Sierra de las Navajas green obsidian, through a preliminary X-ray computed microtomographic study. Crystallinity and micro- or nano-crystallinity were investigated through X-Ray Powder Diffraction and EDS (Energy Dispersion System) microanalyses. Finally, the chemical composition in terms of major and trace elements, including rare earth elements, was determined using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The comparison of samples of different colors suggests that the characteristic green color of Sierra de las Navajas obsidians could be related to their relatively high iron content, and to the occurrence of many elongated and iso-oriented vesicles which may also be responsible for the obsidian's golden hue. Low iron and an absence of vesicles give Lipari obsidian its “normal” black color. The light grey obsidian from Lipari probably owes its color and imperfect conchoidal fracture to numerous bubbles of less than 1 μm in size and to nano-crystallinity. Sierra de las Navajas obsidians show a significant chemical variability in terms of trace elements, that can be explained by common evolutionary processes in the magma chamber. However, this variability is also internal to a single volcanic complex and this makes the trace element contents unsuitable to differentiating between the different sub-sources of the same area. On Lipari, our data do not allow us to distinguish between the two sub-sources of Vallone del Gabellotto and Canneto Dentro on the basis of major and trace elements. On the whole, our study suggests that caution should be used for both Lipari and Sierra de las Navajas when identifying obsidian sub-sources on the basis of trace element contents.","","article","","467","","","Green, grey and black: A comparative study of Sierra de las Navajas (Mexico) and Lipari (Italy) obsidians","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618217306894","1040-6182","2018","369-390","Quaternary International"

This study has also highlighted that electrostatic charge equilibration of aerosols entering the QCM impactor is essential if reliable data are to be obtained.

Most surfaces that we touch in our daily lives are made from organic materials, e.g., vegetables, fruit, skin, wood, and textiles made from natural fibers. In the context of biology, organic surfaces play a prominent role too, proteins docking onto cell surfaces are a good example. To better understand the characteristics of organic surfaces, including physico-chemical properties like wettability or chemical reactivities and physical properties like friction and lubrication, a structurally well-defined model system that can be investigated with numerous analytical techniques is desirable. In the last two decades, one particular system, self-assembled monolayers or SAMs, have demonstrated their suitability for this purpose. In particular, organothiols consisting of an organic molecule with an attached SH-group are well suited to fabricating structurally well-defined adlayers of monolayer thickness on gold substrates using a simple preparation procedure. These ultrathin monolayers expose an organic surface with properties that can be tailored by varying the type of organothiol employed. After a short introduction into the preparation of SAMs, this article provides an overview of the possibilities and limitations of organic surfaces exposed by Au-thiolate SAMs. Applications are as diverse as the metallization of organic surfaces, a fundamental problem in materials science, and the fabrication of surfaces that resist the adsorption of proteins. In addition to a number of different case studies, we will also discuss the most powerful analytical techniques needed to characterize these important model systems.","","article","","84","","","Organic surfaces exposed by self-assembled organothiol monolayers: Preparation, characterization, and application","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079681609000471","0079-6816","2009","230-278","Progress in Surface Science"

Here we review the successes and problems encountered with implementation of the WFD over the past 10years and provide recommendations to further improve the implementation process. We particularly address three fields: (i) the development of assessment methods (including reference conditions, typologies and intercalibration); (ii) the implementation of assessment systems in monitoring programmes; and (iii) the consequences for river basin management plans (such as the design, monitoring and success of restoration measures). The development of assessment methods has been a transparent process and has resulted in improved and more standardised tools for assessing water bodies across Europe. The process has been more time consuming, and methods are more complex, than originally expected. Future challenges still remain, including the estimation of uncertainty of assessment results and a revision of rules in combining the results obtained with different Biological Quality Elements. A huge amount of monitoring data is now being generated for WFD purposes. Monitoring data are not centrally stored and thus poorly accessible for purposes beyond the WFD. Future challenges include enhanced data accessibility and the establishment of a Europe-wide central monitoring network of reference sites. The WFD river basin management plans base management decisions on the response of aquatic organisms to environmental stress. In contrast to the effects of degradation, the biotic response to restoration is less well-known and poorly predictable. The timescale of the WFD (obtaining good ecological status in all surface waters by 2027) is over-ambitious. Future challenges include long-term monitoring of restoration measures to understand the requirements for ecosystems to recover and prioritisation of measures according to re-colonisation potential.","","article","","408","","","The European Water Framework Directive at the age of 10: A critical review of the achievements with recommendations for the future","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710005462","0048-9697","2010","4007-4019","Science of The Total Environment"

In addition to supporting valuable aquaculture and wild-harvest industries, their populations determine the structure of benthic communities, cycling of nutrients, serve as prey resources for higher trophic levels and, in some instances, stabilize shorelines and maintain water quality. This paper reviews existing knowledge of the ecology of host–parasite interactions involving marine molluscs, with a focus on gastropods and bivalves. It considers the ecological and evolutionary impacts of molluscan parasites on their hosts and vice versa, and on the communities and ecosystems in which they are a part, as well as disease management and its ecological impacts. An increasing number of case studies show that disease can have important effects on marine molluscs, their ecological interactions and ecosystem services, at spatial scales from centimeters to thousands of kilometers and timescales ranging from hours to years. In some instances the cascading indirect effects arising from parasitic infection of molluscs extend well beyond the temporal and spatial scales at which molluscs are affected by disease. In addition to the direct effects of molluscan disease, there can be large indirect impacts on marine environments resulting from strategies, such as introduction of non-native species and selective breeding for disease resistance, put in place to manage disease. Much of our understanding of impacts of molluscan diseases on the marine environment has been derived from just a handful of intensively studied marine parasite–host systems, namely gastropod–trematode, cockle–trematode, and oyster–protistan interactions. Understanding molluscan host–parasite dynamics is of growing importance because: (1) expanding aquaculture; (2) current and future climate change; (3) movement of non-native species; and (4) coastal development are modifying molluscan disease dynamics, ultimately leading to complex relationships between diseases and cultivated and natural molluscan populations. Further, in some instances the enhancement or restoration of valued ecosystem services may be contingent on management of molluscan disease. The application of newly emerging molecular tools and remote sensing techniques to the study of molluscan disease will be important in identifying how changes at varying spatial and temporal scales with global change are modifying host–parasite systems.","","article","","131","","","The ecology, evolution, impacts and management of host–parasite interactions of marine molluscs","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022201115300045","0022-2011","2015","177-211","Journal of Invertebrate Pathology"

Whilst the exposed parts showed the highest metal accumulation from the air, the levels of metals in fruits and storage roots resulting from foliar translocation of the airborne component appeared to be low generally.

The DEZ, a topographic high on the Australian plate, encompasses the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge (NDR) and the Bougainville guyot, both of which collide with the island-are slope. In this report we use diving observations and samples, as well as dredging results, to analyse the geology of the Bougainville guyot and the outer arc slope in the DEZ-arc collision zone, and to decipher the mechanisms of scamount subduction. These data indicate that the Bougainville guyot is a middle Eocene island arc volcano capped with reef limestones that appear to have been deposited during the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene and in Miocene-Pliocene times. This guyot possibly emerged during the Middle and Late Miocene, and started to sink in the New Hebrides trench after the Pliocene. The rocks of the New Hebrides arc slope, in the collision zone, consist primarily of Pliocene-Recent volcaniclastic rocks derived from the arc, and underlying fractured island-arc volcanic basement, possibly of Late Miocene age. However, highly sheared, Upper Oligocene to Lower Miocene nannofossil ooze and chalk are exposed at the toe of the arc slope against the northern flank of the NDR. Based on a comparison with cores collected at DSDP Site 286, the ooze and chalk can be interpreted as sediments accreted from the downgoing plate. East of the Bougainville guyot an antiform that developed in the arc slope as a consequence of the collision reveals a 500-m-thick wedge of strongly tectonized rocks, possibly accreted from the guyot or an already subducted seamount. The wedge that is overlain by less deformed volcaniclastic island-arc rocks and sediments includes imbricated layers of Late Oligocene to Early Miocene reef and micritic limestones. This wedge, which develops against the leading flank of the guyot, tends to smooth its high-drag shape. A comparison between the 500-m-thick wedge of limestones that outcrops southeast of the guyot and the absence of such a wedge over the flat top of the guyot, although the top is overthrust by island-arc rocks and sediments, can be interpreted to suggest that the wedge moves in the subduction zone with the guyot and facilitates its subduction by streamlining.","","article","","212","","","Geology of the d'Entrecasteaux-New Hebrides arc collision zone: results from a deep submersible survey","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004019519290292E","0040-1951","1992","213-241","Tectonophysics"

This chapter proposes that no single model or approach can resolve this variability and effectively detect and predict long-term ecosystem changes; a coherent, robust, transparent and reproducible synthesis framework is required. Indicators and models are described that can be used to identify some aspects of the current state of ecosystem structure and to detect and monitor long-term change. A short-term challenge is to synthesize these varied sources of multidisciplinary (and sometimes contradictory) information in a logical and consistent fashion. An expert system approach is proposed to do this, consolidating results of different indicators and models within a dynamic process that uses feedbacks to validate predictions of the expert system, and to improve it. It is suggested that such an approach should be initiated in the short term, even as models and indicators are being developed further. In parallel, multivariate statistical tools should be refined and applied to existing time series, to identify past periods of ecosystem change. Current data gaps should be filled, including time series of primary production and the abundance of gelatinous zooplankton. In the medium term, the expert system model should evolve to a point where its results can be used to inform various management groups about the state of the ecosystem. Part of this evolution requires that ecosystem indicators be presented with error estimates or formal assessments of quality.","","incollection","Elsevier","14","Benguela","","11 Developing a basis for detecting and predicting long-term ecosystem changes","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570046106800169","1570-0461","2006","239-272",""

In addition to outline discussions on various PHA methods, detailed discussions are presented on task analysis to take into account human action errors. Starting from qualitative risk analysis, various independent protection layers are chosen to arrive at semiquantitative risk analysis. Control measures play a very big role in risk analysis. Detailed discussions are presented to address these control measures so that safety of the facilities can be ensured. For complex systems, quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is quite common, so QRA with statistical approaches is covered. Safety management systems are covered to ensure total safety for MHFs.

Therefore, it is important that reconstructions from pollen data are realistic and reliable. Two examples of the need for independent validation of pollen interpretations are considered here. First, Lateglacial-interstadial Betula pollen records in northern Scotland and western Norway have been interpreted frequently as reflecting the presence of tree-birch that has strongly influenced the resulting climate reconstructions. However, no associated tree-birch macrofossils have been found so far, and the local dwarf-shrub or open vegetation reconstructed from macrofossil evidence indicates climates too cold for tree-birch establishment. The low local pollen production resulted in the misleadingly high percentage representation of long-distance tree-birch pollen. Second, in the Minnesotan Lateglacial Picea zone, low pollen percentages from thermophilous deciduous trees could derive either from local occurrences of the tree taxa in the Picea/Larix forest or from long-distance dispersal from areas further south. The regionally consistent occurrence of low pollen percentages, even in sites with local tundra vegetation, and the lack of any corresponding macrofossil records support the hypothesis that the trees were not locally present. Macrofossils in the Picea zone represent tundra vegetation or Picea/Larix forest associated with typically boreal taxa, suggesting it was too cold for most thermophilous deciduous trees to grow. Any long-distance tree pollen is not masked by the low pollen production of tundra and Picea and Larix and therefore it is registered relatively strongly in the percentage pollen spectra. Many Lateglacial pollen assemblages have no recognisable modern analogues and contain high representations of well-dispersed ‘indicator’ taxa such as Betula or Artemisia. The spectra could have been derived from vegetation types that do not occur today, perhaps responding to the different climate that resulted from the different balance of climate forcing functions then. However, the available contemporaneous plant-macrofossil assemblages can be readily interpreted in terms of modern vegetation communities, suggesting that the pollen assemblages could have been influenced by mixing of locally produced pollen with long-distance pollen from remote vegetation types that are then over-represented in situations with low local pollen production. In such situations, it is important to validate the climate reconstructions made from the pollen data with a macrofossil record.","","article","","22","","","The importance of plant macrofossils in the reconstruction of Lateglacial vegetation and climate: examples from Scotland, western Norway, and Minnesota, USA","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379102002482","0277-3791","2003","453-473","Quaternary Science Reviews"

This is followed by a critical, historical review of the literature. The methods used to measure the pH of peatland (mire) waters are examined, and the pH range of various peatland types is reported. In addition, horizontal and vertical pH variations are illustrated, and factors affecting the pH of these waters reviewed. The cause of the low pH of surface waters of Sphagnum bogs (approximately pH 4) is critically investigated, and the relative importance of dissolved CO2 and other inorganic acids, and organic acids to the low pH is assessed. Cation exchange on the surfaces of Sphagnum mosses is found to be a relatively unimportant acidification mechanism, but important to the chemical ecology of the plants. The redox chemistry of mire waters is described in terms of the geochemistry of such redox indicators as O2, CO2, CH4, CO, H2, H2S, SO42−, native Cu, and siderite (FeCO3). Published studies of Eh in peatlands are cited, and the problems of Eh measurement and interpretation are explored. The chemical composition of mire waters (major and trace metals, and nonmetallic species) is examined, and factors affecting their composition reported. The abundance and distribution of mineral matter in peats is described, and the occurrence and formation of minerals of Fe (pyrite and other sulphides, siderite, vivianite), Cu (chalcopyrite, native Cu, covellite) and Zn (smithsonite and wurtzite) investigated.

The density at the source is such that the waters sink beneath the lower-density, more saline waters within the subtropical anticyclonic gyres and the intertropical zones. The shallow minima are relatively minor features within the intertropical zones and lie beneath the high-salinity layers extending from the high-salinity cells of the anticyclones and above the major salinity minima of the Intermediate Water. Vertical mixing eventually eliminates the shallow minima, but only after some thousands of kilometers of flow. Because the high-salinity cell of the North Pacific is at a higher latitude than that in the South Pacific, the northern minimum can extend farther west (to the Philippine Islands) in the intertropical zone; the southern minimum extends (along 15°S) only to about 160°W. Both summer and winter maps of characteristics along an isanostere that lies near the minima have been prepared, and they indicate that in the western Pacific both the North Equatorial Counter-current and the South Equatorial Countercurrent shift northward in winter.","","article","","20","","","The shallow salinity minima of the Pacific Ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0011747173900429","0011-7471","1973","51-68","Deep Sea Research and Oceanographic Abstracts"

All contacts are steep faults against Upper Triassic transitional to alkaline lavas with reefoidal limestones, subalkaline depleted Troodos-type lavas, and serpentinised harzburgite. Ophiolite-related metamorphics are believed to have been formed by dynamothermal processes, beneath young oceanic crust during emplacement. Characteristically, such rocks might be expected to show a decrease of metamorphic grade away from the contact. Mineral analyses from the Ayia Varvara metamorphics, however, show no systematic variations that would indicate a metamorphic gradient. Hornblende remains generally calcic and of tschermakitic hornblende composition with an almost complete substitution of Mg and Fe2+, suggesting disequilibrium. Plagioclase is essentially albitic and remains so for a distance of some 800 m from the harzburgite contact. Trace element analyses of the amphibolites and surrounding extrusives define four lava types. Types 1–3 are transitional to alkaline intraplate lavas believed to be remnants of intraoceanic islands and atolls. Type 4-lavas are extremely depleted in the HFS elements and are very similar to the Arakapas transform-fault lavas. The amphibolites have, in part, a trace-element geochemistry that is close to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB), a type that has not previously been recorded from Cyprus. The small area around Ayia Varvara records a long and complicated tectonic history that provides an insight into the evolution and emplacement of the Troodos ophiolite. The Mamonia Complex is interpreted as a passive margin sequence with intra-oceanic islands that was accreted onto a Late Cretaceous north-dipping subduction zone. Suprasubduction spreading produced the Troodos ophiolite and associated fracture zones. Spreading and subduction ceased in the late Maastrichtian when the newly-formed Troodos crust underwent a 90° anticlockwise rotation which juxtaposed Mamonia and Troodos (Arakapas) fracture zone rocks along arcuate, steep, strike-slip faults. At least some of the Ayia Varvara metamorphic rocks most likely represent Triassic oceanic crust and sediments metamorphosed during subduction by the overriding young Troodos crust.","","article","","212","","","The Ayia Varvara Formation of SW Cyprus: A product of complex collisional tectonics","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004019519290291D","0040-1951","1992","193-211","Tectonophysics"

Large areas of old ocean floor have vanished, probably along former continental margins and islands arcs. Thus most Phanerozoic orogenic belts must include subduction zone effects. Superposed on them may be effects caused by self-heating of thick ‘geosynclinal’ piles of continental margin sediment. It is not yet clear how to discriminate self-heating from slip-zone heating effects. Paleomagnetic data also show that rigid areas of the continental crust have been in relative motion for at least 2500 m.y. These data imply that plates existed and that subduction may have been active since at least the beginning of Proterozoic time. Paleomagnetic data and mapping suggest that some Proterozoic African orogenic belts may not have originated by plate-tectonic processes, though the evidence is inconclusive. There is no geophysical evidence for or against the existence of Archean plates. The causes of Archean orogenesis are speculative. Some plate-tectonic models appear to differ significantly from the actual orogenic belts they purport to describe. In particular, long-continued subduction does not necessarily give rise to continental accretion, but in some cases may actually involve tectonic erosion of the overriding plate by the slip zone. Subduction of continental crust is likely to have taken place in the Alps and probably in many other orogenic belts. Probable continental margin sequences of pre-Mesozoic age are common. Some of these could have been deposited along Atlantic-type continental margins, but in no case has the matching continental fragment been identified. Without such identification, Atlantic-type continental margin sequences cannot be readily distinguished from sequences formed at the borders of new ocean basins next to wide, migrating, active island arcs (‘marginal basins’). Additional evidence suggests that the Cambro-Ordovician sequences of northwest Scotland cannot be deposits formed on an Atlantic-type continental margin, and that the same sequence in northwest Newfoundland may not have formed along such a margin. The plate tectonic significance of most orogenic features is unknown or controversial. How andesites originate is not understood; the reasons for the systematic potash variations with depth to the slip zone in andesite suites are unknown; and the significance of foreland deformation, of slaty cleavage and of regional metamorphism are disputed. Nevertheless, the solutions to all of the above problems are considered attainable, but will require a constant interplay between field, laboratory and theoretical work.","","article","","33","","","Plate tectonics and orogeny: A review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195176901487","0040-1951","1976","215-285","Tectonophysics"

Yet, millennial-scaled climate variability and stochastic internal variability that result in (inter)glacial transitions remain poorly understood. Here, three speleothems from two different cave systems in Belgium are investigated to characterize the Eemian to early Weichselian transition. The speleothems show high reproducibility for δ13C, interpreted as a proxy for past vegetation activity, controlled by type of vegetation above the cave. All three speleothems show a drastic increase in δ13C between 118 and 117 ka, reflecting a rapid change in vegetation from last interglacial temperate tree species towards glacial open-grass vegetation. This transition shows a strong affinity with the Late Eemian Aridity Pulse (LEAP) at 118 ± 1 ka, previously identified in pollen records from Western Germany. An age of 117.7 ± 0.5 ka is determined for the start of this transition in the Belgian speleothems. The speleothem records show a distinct transition in the proxies between Eemian optimum conditions and increased variability during the glacial inception and therefore the Eemian-Weichselian transition is set at 117.7 ± 0.5 ka in the speleothem records. High-resolution trace element analysis shows that the transition is initiated by a cooling pulse followed by a decrease in precipitation. Through comparison with other archives, including North-Atlantic sedimentary records, it is proposed that the transition at 117.7 ka constitutes an internal climate response caused by a substantial input of freshwater from degraded ice-sheets by the end of the Eemian (∼120-118 ka).","","article","","208","","","Characterizing the Eemian-Weichselian transition in northwestern Europe with three multiproxy speleothem archives from the Belgian Han-sur-Lesse and Remouchamps cave systems","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118302300","0277-3791","2019","21-37","Quaternary Science Reviews"

In the Acqui Terme-Visone area, these geothermal waters ascend along zones of high vertical permeability and discharge at the surface almost undiluted or mixed with cold, shallow waters. To the SW of Acqui Terme, other ascending geothermal waters, either undiluted or mixed with low-salinity waters, enter relatively shallow secondary reservoirs, where they reequilibrate at 65–70°C. Both chemical and isotopic data indicate that bacterial SO4 reduction affects all these waters, especially those discharged by the secondary reservoirs. Therefore, geothermal waters must get in contact with oil, acquiring the relatively oxidized organic substances needed by SO4-reducing bacteria. This oil–water interaction process deserves further investigations, for potential economic implications.","","article","","15","","","Fluid geochemistry of the Acqui Terme-Visone geothermal area (Piemonte, Italy)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292799000943","0883-2927","2000","917-935","Applied Geochemistry"

China's unique wealth of written history provides an abundance of proxy data on the climatic record and that record now furnishes a basis for analysing both long-term and short-term fluctuations, as well as sunspot behavior, that together provide an insight into extraterrestrial forcing. Recent Chinese work suggests a solar forcing, but our own studies suggest rather that a lunar tidal component, reinforced at times by the solar element may prove more important. Analysis of a drought-flood index for Peking (Beijing) in northeastern China since A.D. 1470 supports evidence (Hameed et al., 1983) for both periodic lunar nodal 18.6-year and solar cyclic 11-year induced drought-flood in the region. The nodal term exhibits bistable phasing with respect to epochs of tidal maxima (for our century epochs occurred at 1917.5, 1936.1, 1954.7 and 1973.3), a phenomenon previously found in drought-flood proxy data for South America (Currie, 1983), India (Currie, 1984a), North America (Currie, 1984d), and Africa (Hameed and Currie, 1985; Currie and Hameed, 1985).

Analysis of the various sectors under consideration (seismic groupings, differentiated seismic sources in the Betic Cordillera, crustal domains and lithospheric domains) provides values of the afore-mentioned parameters coherent with the known tectonic evolution of this area. We also show that the b parameter is not reliable for small-size seismic sources because of the poor statistical representativity of the sample (very few years for small regions). The b parameter values obtained for both crustal and lithospheric domains are remarkably similar and can be linked with what is to be expected in highly fractured sectors. This supports the hypotheses that explain the existence of intermediate seismicity by movement of faults cutting almost the entire lithosphere, or even by the possible presence of a zone of incipient subduction.","","article","","248","","","The b parameter in the Betic Cordillera, Rif and nearby sectors.

Here, I take a micrometeorological perspective and review these technological advances, assess key instrument performance characteristics, examine how these techniques have been used in the field to improve our understanding of the processes governing the exchange of CO2 and water vapor, and discuss future research directions. Review of the recent literature indicates that: (1) optical techniques have been used to quantify the isotope composition of biosphere–atmosphere exchange using the traditional Keeling mixing line, flux–gradient, eddy covariance, and chamber approaches under a variety of field conditions with near-continuous data records now extending to more than 5-years; (2) high frequency and near continuous isotope measurements at the canopy scale have demonstrated important new insights regarding the behaviour of kinetic fractionation at the leaf versus canopy scales and the controls on ecosystem respiration that could not have been observed previously using traditional methods; (3) based on the assessment of instrument performance, carbon isotope disequilibrium (the difference between the isotope composition of photosynthesis and respiration), carbon turnover rates, and measurement uncertainties, 13C-CO2 investigations are best suited for examining the contributions and changes to ecosystem respiration with a need for more innovative 13C-isotope labeling experiments and compound specific isotope analyses under field conditions; (4) significant progress has been made in measuring the oxygen isotope composition of water vapor fluxes and canopy leaf water enrichment. These new data have provided an opportunity to evaluate models of leaf water enrichment and their application to the canopy scale; and (5) the use of 18O-H2O and 18O-CO2 as tracers of the coupled carbon–water cycle has matured significantly in recent years. Evidence from a range of ecosystems indicates that 18O-CO2 disequilibrium (ranging from 0 to 17‰) is much larger than for 13C-CO2 (typical less than 3‰ in natural C3 ecosystems) making it a useful tracer of coupled carbon and water cycle processes. However, a better understanding of the role of carbonic anhydrase in photosynthetic and respiratory processes under field conditions is now needed in order to make further progress. Finally, the increasing use and development of isotope-enabled land surface schemes along with the acquisition of high temporal resolution isotope data is providing a new opportunity to constrain the carbon and water cycle processes represented in these models.","","article","","174-175","","","Tracing the flow of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the biosphere and atmosphere: A review of optical isotope techniques and their application","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192313000373","0168-1923","2013","85-109","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

Despite the fact that ED in invertebrates has been investigated on a smaller scale than in vertebrates, invertebrates provide some of the best documented examples for deleterious effects in wildlife populations following an exposure to endocrine-active substances. The article provides an overview of the diversity in endocrine systems of invertebrates. The principal susceptibility of invertebrates to endocrine-active compounds is demonstrated with the case studies of tributyltin effects in mollusks and of insect growth regulators, the latter as purposely synthesized endocrine disrupters. The additional evidence for ED in invertebrates from laboratory and field studies is summarized as an update and amendment of the EDIETA report from 1998.

The approximation converts the radiation budget components at the top of the Earth's atmosphere into two effective cloud parameters: cloud amount and cloud-top height over the latitude belt 58.5°S–58.5°N. Instead of real three-level cloudiness the approximation treats global cloudiness as one opaque layer with determined albedo for solar radiation. Cloud emissivity is supposed to be 1. The main goal for the approximation is to use these effective parameters for describing the interannual redistribution of cloudiness.

Among the most emblematic forms of Mediterranean land use, olive groves and pastoralism have occupied a prominent place. Therefore, it is vital to know when, how, and with what ecological consequences these practices were established and developed. Located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea, Crete is the largest island of Greece. The island is characterised by a long human history of land use, but our understanding of past environmental changes for the entire Holocene is fragmentary. This paper presents a new investigation of Lake Kournas in Crete, where recent coring provided a 15-m sequence covering ten millennia of land cover and land-use history. The study of this new core involves the analysis of the sediment dynamics, flood deposits, pollen, diatoms, fungal and algal remains, and microcharcoals. Results show that ecosystem development near Lake Kournas was not a linear process. They reveal linkages and feedbacks between vegetation, biodiversity, fire, human impact, erosion, and climate change. A possible human occupation and agro-pastoral activities around the lake may have been detected as early as 9500 cal BP, perhaps in a transitional phase between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. At 8500 cal BP, climatic conditions may have promoted the expansion of the evergreen oak woodland. However, human impact was probably the most important driver of ecosystem change with the establishment of an agro-system after 8000 years ago. Thereafter, the trajectory of Kournas’ lake and catchment ecosystems from the Mid to Late Holocene follow the rhythm of land-use change. Among the traditional Mediterranean land uses, olive cultivation locally played a major role in the socio-ecosystem interactions, providing economic benefits but also destabilising soils. During the last six millennia, three main phases of olive cultivation occurred during the Final Neolithic-Minoan period, the Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine (HRB) period and Modern times. Along with the changing land use under the successive political and economic influences rules, the resilience capacities of vegetation permitted it to shift back to higher biodiversity again after decreasing phases. Forest vegetation was always able to recover until the onset of the Venetian period (13th century), when woodlands were dramatically reduced.

Groundwater evolution is dominated by carbonate and sulphate mineral solution and precipitation and by redox reactions; cation exchange reactions are negligible and the hydrogeochemistry has evolved in the absence of residual saline water. Three distinct zones are recognised: 1.I. Recent groundwater (mainly < 100 y), oxidising, dominated by congruent dissolution of dolomite, and by inputs from atmospheric and anthropogenic sources.2.II. Groundwater age 103–104 y, predominantly reducing, dominated by incongruent dissolution of dolomite.3.III. Groundwater age > 104 y, reducing conditions, approach to isotopic and chemical equilibrium in the carbonate system, dominance of gypsum dissolution. The minor and trace element variation can be interpreted in relation to the principal geochemical reactions and recharge history. Na+, Cl−, F− and B are controlled by atmospheric inputs. Sr2+ and Mn2+ trends can be explained by carbonate and sulphate mineral dissolution; Ba2+ is derived from carbonates but controlled by barite equilibrium. Fe, SO42−, NO3− and U are strongly influenced by redox reactions. The concentrations of transition metals and other elements remain very low. Only Li+ and K+ are considered to represent additions by reaction of silicate minerals. The extent of direct anthropogenic influence is probably limited to enhanced SO4−, NO32− and possibly Cu, Zn and Pb in Zone I.","","article","","46","","","Hydrochemical evolution of the East Midlands Triassic sandstone aquifer, England","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703782901867","0016-7037","1982","2069-2081","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

It contrasts two different paradigms of how rules and their development and use are perceived and managed. The first is a top-down classical, rational approach in which rules are seen as static, comprehensive limits of freedom of choice, imposed on operators at the sharp end and violations are seen as negative behaviour to be suppressed. The second is a bottom-up constructivist view of rules as dynamic, local, situated constructions of operators as experts, where competence is seen to a great extent as the ability to adapt rules to the diversity of reality. The paper explores the research underlying and illustrating these two paradigms, drawn from psychology, sociology and ethnography, organisational studies and behavioural economics. In a separate paper following on from this review (Hale and Borys, this issue) the authors propose a framework of rule management which attempts to draw the lessons from both paradigms. It places the monitoring and adaptation of rules central to its management process.","","article","","55","","","Working to rule, or working safely?

We aim to evaluate whether energy innovation cycle dynamics analysis in Tunisia helps boost energy efficiency and transition performance to sustainability. Indeed, we suggest to work on both simulation and prediction approaches of chaotic systems to understand how energy innovation cycle genesis and control can contribute to an adequate future situation of sustainable clean renewable energy transition. We will focus more on modeling and analysis of its nonlinear dynamical system from a conceptualized and methodological point of view. As a result, we find that the reconstructed phase space of Rössler’s system and the bifurcation diagram are perfectly adequate to demonstrate the genesis of endogenous cycle of the innovation dynamical system inspired from Goodwin’s work. Similarly, studying the dynamics complexity of the endogenous innovation cycle of a clean renewable energy system does not only serve as a possible helping factor for understanding the transition policy via adopting a sustainable energetic future strategy in Tunisia but also as an efficient actor for controlling the complexity and stability of energy transition dynamical system. Therefore it is a right decision criterion for the successful regulation and the planning for every necessary strategic policy intervention for any sustainable development.

If we can decompose these complex encounter processes into motion primitives, which represent the elementary interaction patterns, an encounter can be more easily understood and identified. In this study, we propose a two-stream Long Short-Term Memory-based autoencoder (LSTM-based AE) approach to extract motion primitives from multi-dimensional encounter data without specific rules and prior knowledge. This approach leverages the sequential representation ability of LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies of each encountering ship motion. Then, we developed a fusion gate named dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) to fuse the outputs of two LSTMs and generated the high-level representation needed to capture the spatiotemporal relationships of the interactions. After that, through a clustering method, the motion primitives were automatically extracted to describe various interaction patterns. The effectiveness of this approach was validated by naturalistic encounter data. The low reconstruction errors of the LSTM-based AE demonstrated that high-level representations captured the relationships of the interactions in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Case studies demonstrated that the utilization of motion primitives provided a semantically interpretable technique to analyze the interaction patterns and encounter process, which is conducive to situation awareness and decision-making for developing intelligent ships.","","article","","247","","","Motion primitives learning of ship-ship interaction patterns in encounter situations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801822001603","0029-8018","2022","110708","Ocean Engineering"

This work explores basic properties of acoustic emission signals measured on a small single cylinder diesel engine in a laboratory setting. As reported in other works in the open literature, the measured acoustic emission on the engine is mostly continuous mode and individual burst events are generally not readily identifiable. Therefore, the AE are processed into the local (instantaneous) root mean square (rms) value of the signal which is averaged over many cycles to obtain a mean rms AE in the crank angle domain. Crank-resolved spectral representation of the AE is also given but rigorous investigation of the AE spectral qualities is left to future study. Cycle-to-cycle statistical dispersion of the AE signal is considered to highlight highly variable engine processes. Engine speed was held constant but load conditions are varied to investigate AE signal sensitivity to operating condition. Furthermore, during the course of testing the fuel injector developed a fault and acoustic emission signals were captured and several signal attributes were successful in distinguishing this altered condition. The sampling and use of instantaneous rms acoustic emission signal demonstrated promise for non-intrusive and economical change detection of engine injection, combustion and valve events.","","article","","93","","","Acoustic emission characteristics of a single cylinder diesel generator at various loads and with a failing injector","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327017300547","0888-3270","2017","397-414","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing"

The resulting time series have been further analyzed to provide a climatology for sea-ice and polynya characteristics. The ice regime of the Laptev Sea is characterized by a large seasonal and interannual variability, the latter occurring exclusively in summer. By using a consistent sea-ice data record, we can document negative trends in all the areas studied for the 24-year period, Due to the large interannual variability the trends are not significant. For the entire Laptev Sea the decreases in sea-ice extent and area on a yearly average basis reveal −1.5% decade−1 and −1.7% decade−1, respectively. In summer and early fall large losses in sea-ice cover of up to 7% decade−1 are evident in regional sectors of the Laptev Sea. In addition, an increase in polynya activity in late winter and early spring, a significant shift towards earlier snowmelt onset, and an increase of open-water area in early fall indicating an extension of the length of the summer melt period, has been observed. A brief overview of climate and sea-ice research in the Siberian Arctic is presented. According to observational data and numerical experiments there is still a large degree of uncertainty about the role of dynamic and thermodynamic factors and possible feedback mechanisms in the atmosphere–ice–ocean system, which are responsible for the large interannual variability and the retreat of sea-ice coverage as observed in the 1990s. Summer sea-ice anomalies likely result from synoptic-scale processes superimposed by the large-scale atmospheric circulation during summer and to a lesser extent from preconditioning processes in winter and spring.","","article","","48","","","Spatial and temporal variability of sea ice in the Laptev Sea: Analyses and review of satellite passive-microwave data and model results, 1979 to 2002","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818105000573","0921-8181","2005","28-54","Global and Planetary Change"

Given the weak constraints on the role that cloud formation plays in climate forcing it is essential to understand the role such a relationship could have in shaping the Earth's climate. This issue has been previously investigated in the context of the long-term effect of cosmic ray events on climate. However, in order to establish whether or not such a relationship exists, measurements of short-timescale solar events, individual cosmic ray events, and spatially correlated cloud parameters could be of great significance. Here we propose such a comparison using observations from a pair of radio telescopes arrays, the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) and the Eight-meter-wavelength Transient Array (ETA). These low-frequency radio arrays have a unique ability to simultaneously conduct solar, ionospheric and cosmic rays observations and are thus ideal for such a comparison.

Hydrographic section data are complemented by temperature, salinity, and velocity time series recorded by two moorings. They have been deployed at the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the Newfoundland Basin during 1996–2004. The analysis of hydrographic anomalies at various longitudes points to a gradual eastward propagation of LSW-related signals, which happens on time scales of 3–6 years from the formation region towards the MAR. Interactions of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) close to Flemish Cap point to the NAC being the main distributor of the different types of LSW into the interior of the Newfoundland Basin. Comparisons between the ship data and the mooring records revealed that the mooring sites are located in a region affected by highly variable flow. The mooring time series demonstrate an elevated level of variability with eddy activity and variability associated with the NAC considerably influencing the LSW signals in this region. Hydrographic data taken from Argo profiles from the vicinity of the mooring sites turned out to mimic quite well the temporal evolution captured by the moorings. There is some indication of occasional southward flow in the LSW layer near the MAR. If this can be considered as a hint to an interior LSW-route, it is at least of minor importance in comparison to the DWBC. It acts as an important supplier for the interior North Atlantic, distributing older and recently formed LSW modes southward along the MAR.","","article","","56","","","Variability and propagation of Labrador Sea Water in the southern subpolar North Atlantic","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063709001058","0967-0637","2009","1656-1674","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

Spectral and spatial thresholds were used on difference images between master and slave data in the extraction of temporally invariant targets for multi-platform cross calibration. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to evaluate any difference in the cumulative probability distributions of the master, slave and calibrated slave data as expressed by the D statistic, with values reduced by an average of 89.7% due to the cross calibration procedure. A change detection model was created which incorporated a spatial threshold of 9 pixels and a standard deviation (SD) spectral threshold. Kappa accuracy values for the five sites ranged from 80 to 97%, showing that 1.5SD was the optimum spectral threshold for detecting vegetation change. Change detection results showed mean percentage change ranging from 2.11 to 3.28% of total area and cumulative change over the observed time period of between 15.24 and 49.27% of total area.","","article","","31","","","A monitoring protocol for vegetation change on Irish peatland and heath","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243414000567","1569-8432","2014","130-142","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation"

Glacial activity is sensitive to climate change in this area. However, due to high annual ablation and accumulation in this region, ice cores over long time scales are difficult to retrieve. In addition, reconstructed glacial activity from moraine dates is usually discontinuous. Here, we use a sediment core retrieved from Laigu Lake, which is a proglacial lake located in the headwaters of the Parlung Zangbo River, the largest tributary of the Brahmaputra River, to reflect glacial activities over the last ~8000years in this area. Samples of the sediment core were analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, XRF (X-ray florescence) scanned elemental concentration and grain size. The results indicated that the magnetic susceptibility and CPS (peak area counts per second) of strontium (Sr) could be used as proxies for glacial activity. The CPS of Sr and the magnetic susceptibility were lower and the glacial activity was weak before 4.3calka BP. Expansion of the glaciers in this area began from 4.3calka BP and continued to develop after ~3.3calka BP. From 2.2calka BP to 1.6calka BP, the glaciers retreated substantially, followed by another development period until the onset of modern global warming. Based on our findings and other climate records, we concluded that glacial activity in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau areas was mainly influenced by Northern Hemisphere temperatures and summer insolation over a sub-orbital time scale, but did not respond to the Indian monsoon.","","article","","456","","","Glacial activity reflected in a continuous lacustrine record since the early Holocene from the proglacial Laigu Lake on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018216301596","0031-0182","2016","37-45","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

ISHM fundamentally relies on assessments and predictions of system health, including the early detection of failures and estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Model-based, data-driven or hybrid reasoning techniques can be utilized to maximise the timeliness and reliability of diagnosis and prognosis information. The benefits of ISHM include enhancing the maintainability, reliability, safety and performance of systems. The next evolution of the ISHM concept, Intelligent Health and Mission Management (IHMM), delves deeper into the utilization of on-line system health predictions to modify mission profiles to ensure safety and reliability, as well as efficiency through predictive integrity. This concept is particularly important for Trusted Autonomous System (TAS) applications, where an accurate assessment of the current and future system state-of-health to make operational decisions (with or without human intervention) is integral to both flight safety and mission success. IHMM systems introduce the capability of predicting degradation in the functional performance of subsystems, with sufficient time to dynamically identify which appropriate restorative or reconfiguration actions to take in order to ensure that the system can perform at an acceptable level of operational capability before the onset of a failure event. This paper reviews some of the key advancements and contributions to knowledge in the field of ISHM for the aerospace industry, with a particular focus on various architectures and reasoning strategies involving the use of artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the key challenges faced in the development and deployment of ISHM systems in the aerospace industry and highlights the safety-critical role that IHMM will play in future cyber-physical and autonomous system applications (both vehicle and ground support systems), such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS).","","article","","128","","","Advances in Integrated System Health Management for mission-essential and safety-critical aerospace applications","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376042121000622","0376-0421","2022","100758","Progress in Aerospace Sciences"

For the last 5–10 years, few studies have demonstrated the possibility to also observe smaller water bodies than previously thought feasible (river smaller than 500m wide and lake below 10km2). The present study aims at quantifying the nadir altimetry performance over a medium river (200m or lower wide) with a pluvio-nival regime in a temperate climate (the Garonne River, France). Three altimetry missions have been considered: ENVISAT (from 2002 to 2010), Jason-2 (from 2008 to 2014) and SARAL (from 2013 to 2014). Compared to nearby in situ gages, ENVISAT and Jason-2 observations over the lower Garonne River mainstream (110 km upstream of the estuary) have the smallest errors, with water elevation anomalies root mean square errors (RMSE) around 50cm and 20cm, respectively. The few ENVISAT upstream measurements have RMSE ranging from 80cm to 160cm. Over the estuary, ENVISAT and SARAL water elevation anomalies RMSE are around 30cm and 10cm, respectively. The most recent altimetry mission, SARAL, does not provide river elevation measurements for most satellite overflights of the river mainstream. The altimeter remains “locked” on the top of surrounding hilly areas and does not observe the steep-sided river valley, which could be 50–100m lower. This phenomenon is also observed, for fewer dates, on Jason-2 and ENVISAT measurements. In these cases, the measurement is not “erroneous”, it just does not correspond to water elevation of the river that is covered by the satellite. ENVISAT is less prone to get ‘locked’ on the top of the topography due to some differences in the instrument measurement parameters, trading lower accuracy for more useful measurements. Such problems are specific to continental surfaces (or near the coasts), but are not observed over the open oceans, which are flatter. To overcome this issue, an experimental instrument operating mode, called the DIODE/DEM tracking mode, has been developed by CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) and has been tested during few Jason-2 cycles and during the first SARAL/AltiKA cycle. This tracking mode “forces” the instrument to observe a target of interest, i.e. water bodies. The example of the Garonne River shows, for one SARAL ground track, the benefit of the DIODE/DEM tracking mode for a steep-sided river reach, which is not detected using the nominal instrument operating mode. Yet, this mode relies on ancillary datasets (a priori global DEM and global land/water mask), which are critical to obtain river valley observation. The ultimately computed elevations along the satellite tracks, loaded on board, should have an absolute vertical accuracy around 10m (or better). This case also shows, when the instrument is correctly observing the river valley, that the altimeter can detect water bodies narrower than 100m (like an artificial canal). In agreement with recent studies, this work shows that altimeter missions can provide useful water elevation measurements over a 200m wide river with RMSE as low as 50cm and 20cm, for ENVISAT and Jason-2 respectively. The seasonal cycle can be observed with the temporal sampling of these missions (35 days and 10 days, respectively), but short term events, like flood events, are most of the time not observed. It also illustrates that altimeter capability to observe a river is highly dependent of the surrounding topography, the observation configuration, previous measurements and the instrument design. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize at global scale the minimum river width that could be seen by altimeters. This study analyzes, for the first time, the potential of the experimental DIODE/DEM tracking mode to observe steep-sided narrow river valleys, which are frequently missed with nominal tracking mode. For such case, using the DIODE/DEM mode could provide water elevation measurements, as long as the on board DEM is accurate enough. This mode should provide many more valid measurements over steep-sided rivers than currently observed.","","article","","59","","","Satellite radar altimetry water elevations performance over a 200m wide river: Evaluation over the Garonne River","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117716305865","0273-1177","2017","128-146","Advances in Space Research"

However, researchers in other safety–critical domains have long since abandoned the quest for zero defects as an impractical goal, choosing to focus instead on the development of strategies to enhance the ability to recover from error. This paper presents a cognitive framework for the study of error recovery, and the results of our empirical research into error detection and recovery in the critical care domain, using both laboratory-based and naturalistic approaches. Both attending physicians and residents were prone to commit, detect and recover from errors, but the nature of these errors was different. Experts corrected the errors as soon as they detected them and were better able to detect errors requiring integration of multiple elements in the case. Residents were more cautious in making decisions showing a slower error recovery pattern, and the detected errors were more procedural in nature with specific patient outcomes. Error detection and correction are shown to be dependent on expertise, and on the nature of the everyday tasks of the clinicians concerned. Understanding the limits and failures of human decision-making is important if we are to build robust decision-support systems to manage the boundaries of risk of error in decision-making. Detection and correction of potential error is an integral part of cognitive work in the complex, critical care workplace.","","article","","44","","","Recovery at the edge of error: Debunking the myth of the infallible expert","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046410001371","1532-0464","2011","413-424","Journal of Biomedical Informatics"

The proposed algorithm detects a contiguous foreground via a contiguously weighted linear regression (CWLR) model. It consists of a background model and a foreground model. The background model is a regression based low rank model. It seeks a low rank background subspace and represents the background as the linear combination of the basis spanning the subspace. The foreground model promotes the contiguity in the foreground detection. It encourages the foreground to be detected as whole regions rather than separated pixels. We formulate the background and foreground model into a contiguously weighted linear regression problem. This problem can be solved efficiently via an alternating optimization approach which includes continuous and discrete variables. Given an image sequence, we use the first few frames to incrementally initialize the background subspace, and we determine the background and foreground in the following frames in an online scheme using the proposed CWLR model, with the background subspace continuously updated using the detected background information. The proposed algorithm is implemented by Python on a NAO humanoid robot based monitoring system. This system consists of a control station and a Nao robot. The Nao robot acts as a mobile probe. It captures image sequence and sends it to the control station. The control station serves as a control terminal. It sends commands to control the behavior of Nao robot, and it processes the image data sent by Nao. This system can be used for living environment monitoring and form the basis for many vision-based applications like fall detection and scene understanding. The experimental comparisons with most recent algorithms on both benchmark dataset and NAO captures demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","","article","","85","","","An online background subtraction algorithm deployed on a NAO humanoid robot based monitoring system","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889015300361","0921-8890","2016","37-47","Robotics and Autonomous Systems"

In this study, we combine volcanic gas emissions measured for the first time in August 2015 with longer-term measurements of thermal output and lava extrusion rates between 2011 and 2015 calculated from MODIS satellite data with the aim to develop a better understanding of the nature of volcanic activity at Mount Cleveland. Degassing measurements were made in the month following two explosive events (21 July and 7 August 2015) and during a period of new dome growth in the summit crater. SO2 emission rates ranged from 400 to 860td−1 and CO2/SO2 ratios were <3, consistent with the presence of shallow magma in the conduit and the observed growth of a new lava dome. Thermal anomalies derived from MODIS data from 2011 to 2015 had an average repose time of only 4days, pointing to the continuous nature of volcanic activity at this volcano. Rapid increases in the cumulative thermal output were often coincident with visual confirmation of dome growth or accumulations of tephra in the crater. The average rate of lava extrusion calculated for 9 periods of rapid increase in thermal output was 0.28m3s−1, and the total volume extruded from 2011 to 2015 was 1.9–5.8Mm3. The thermal output from the lava extrusion events only accounts for roughly half of the thermal budget, suggesting a continued presence of shallow magma in the upper conduit, likely driven by convection. Axisymmetric dome morphology and occasional drain back of lava into the conduit suggests low-viscosity magmas drive volcanism at Mount Cleveland. It follows also that only small overpressures can be maintained given the small domes and fluid magmas, which is consistent with the low explosivity of most of Mount Cleveland's eruptions. Changes between phases of dome growth and explosive activity are somewhat unpredictable and likely result from plugs that are related to the dome obtaining a critical dimension, or from small variations in the magma ascent rate that lead to crystallization-induced blockages in the upper conduit, thereby reducing the ability of magma to degas. We suggest the small magma volumes, slow ascent rates, and low magma viscosity lead to the overall lack of anomalous geophysical signals prior to eruptions, and that more continuous volcanic degassing measurements might lead to more successful eruption forecasting at this continuously-active open-vent volcano.","","article","","337","","","Magmatic degassing, lava dome extrusion, and explosions from Mount Cleveland volcano, Alaska, 2011–2015: Insight into the continuous nature of volcanic activity over multi-year timescales","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027316304358","0377-0273","2017","98-110","Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research"

In recent years, many taxi companies have been routinely collecting data to track the movement of each taxi for improving security, coordination, and service performance. This paper is intended to use the GPS vehicle positioning data to assess the route choice behavior of taxi drivers and explore if the routes selected by taxi drivers can be incorporated into a traveler information system. It is often perceived that taxi drivers have the ability to select quality routes assuming that: (1) they tend to be more knowledgeable about alternative routes and time-dependent traffic conditions than general public, including some publicly available route guidance systems due to the nature of their profession; and (2) they are typically more motivated to incorporate their knowledge about traffic conditions into their route choice decisions. An experimental study is conducted to examine the validity of these two assumptions. We have developed a framework that can effectively process the data into information about routes selected by taxi drivers and their associated travel times. The performance of the routes selected by taxi drivers is compared with the performance of those recommended by e-maps. Our results indicate that the routes selected by taxi drivers are generally more efficient than the routes recommended by some major e-maps, suggesting that taxi drivers are more active in selecting routes to avoid congestion.","","article","","25","","","A data driven approach to assessing the reliability of using taxicab as probes for Real-Time route selections","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547245022002961","1547-2450","2021","331-342","Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems"

We utilize data from various satellite sensors to examine pollutant emissions from oil exploitation activities in four areas near the Arctic. Despite the remoteness of these sparsely populated areas, tropospheric NO2 retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is substantial at ∼1 × 1015 molecules cm−2, suggesting sizeable emissions from these industrial activities. Statistically significant (at the 95% confidence level, corresponding uncertainties in parentheses) increasing trends of 0.017 (±0.01) × 1015 and 0.015 (±0.006) × 1015 molecules cm−2 year−1 over 2004–2015 were found for Bakken (USA) and Athabasca (Canada), two areas having recently experienced fast expansion in the oil industry. This rapid change has implications for emission inventories, which are updated less frequently. No significant trend was found for the North Sea (Europe), where oil production has been declining since the 1990s. For northern Russia, the trend was just under the 95% significance threshold at 0.0057 (±0.006) × 1015 molecules cm−2 year−1. This raises an interesting inconsistency as prior studies have suggested that, in contrast to the continued, albeit slow, expansion of Russian oil/gas production, gas flaring in Russia has decreased in recent years. However, only a fraction of oil fields in Russia were covered in our analysis. Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data revealed similar tendencies, albeit at a weaker level of statistical significance, due to the longer lifetime of aerosols and contributions from other sources.

It has been 20 years since the IOD was first formally defined and research since that time has focused primarily on examining IOD dynamics, trends and impacts in observational records and in model simulations. However, considerable uncertainty exists due to the brevity of reliable instrumental data for the Indian Ocean basin and also due to known biases in model representations of tropical Indian Ocean climate. Consequently, the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) concluded that there was only low confidence in projections of a future increase in the strength and frequency of positive IOD events. This review examines the additional perspectives that palaeoclimate evidence provides on IOD trends, variability, interactions with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and impacts. Palaeoclimate data show that recent trends towards more frequent and intense positive IOD events have been accompanied by a mean shift toward a more positive IOD-like mean zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Indian Ocean (due to enhanced warming in the west relative to the east). The increasing frequency of positive IOD events will imminently move outside of the range of natural variability in the last millennium if projected trends continue. Across a range of past climate states, periods of a mean positive IOD-like state in the Indian Ocean have been accompanied by elevated IOD variability. This includes events that exceed the magnitude of even the strongest measured historical events, demonstrating that the Indian Ocean can harbour even stronger variability than what has been observed to date. During the last millennium there has been a tight coupling between the magnitude of interannual IOD and ENSO variability, although positive IOD events have frequently occurred without any indication of a co-occurring El Niño event. This IOD–ENSO coupling may not have persisted across past climates that were very different from the present, raising questions of whether their interaction will change in a rapidly warming future. Palaeoclimate evidence for hydroclimate changes during the last millennium further points to the importance of interannual IOD and ENSO variability in providing the rainfall that breaks droughts in regions that are impacted by these modes of variability. Overall, this review highlights the rich insights into the IOD that can be gained from palaeoclimate evidence. Palaeoclimate data helps to overcome known limitations in observations and model simulations of the IOD, and demonstrates that strong conclusions about the IOD and its impacts can be reached when the evidence for past, present and future behaviour of the IOD are assessed together.","","article","","237","","","Palaeoclimate perspectives on the Indian Ocean Dipole","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027737912030264X","0277-3791","2020","106302","Quaternary Science Reviews"

In July 2015 and 2016 surface water samples were collected from sites in the tidal-fresh Potomac River in the vicinity of the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (BPAWWTP) outfall near Washington, DC USA along with treated MWW effluent samples from the BPAWWTP. Dissolved Rb/Sr ratios were measured in these waters and compared to dissolved Gd concentrations in order to demonstrate the potential of the dissolved Rb/Sr ratio as a conservative indicator for MWW effluent. Results suggest the dissolved Rb/Sr ratio represents a simple and cost-effective indicator and conservative tracer for MWW effluent. It can be used with, or in place of, other proven tracers to investigate wastewater impacts in highly-urbanized, anthropogenically-impacted freshwater systems like the tidal fresh Potomac River and perhaps in a wider range of geologic settings than previously thought. A case study is presented as an example to demonstrate the potential of using dissolved Rb/Sr ratios to trace MWW-sourced nutrient inputs from a major WWTP like BPAWWTP to the receiving waters of tidal-fresh Potomac River.","","article","","205","","","Dissolved rubidium to strontium ratio as a conservative tracer for wastewater effluent-sourced contaminant inputs near a major urban wastewater treatment plant","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313542100885X","0043-1354","2021","117691","Water Research"

A better understanding of the emission sources and environmental fate/sink of carbonaceous components is critical for improving our knowledge of the global carbon cycle and mitigating the negative environmental impacts of air pollution and climate change on human well-being. Radiocarbon (14C), which is decayed completely in fossil fuel (e.g. coal and petroleum), is an ideal tool for quantifying the carbon flow in various carbon reservoirs. This study reviews the current knowledge of 14C in organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), individual organic compounds, methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), annual plants, and tree rings. The impacts of fossil and non-fossil sources on the atmosphere can be quantified by measuring 14C. We also report on the influence of nuclear power plants and sea-air gas exchange on the abundance of 14C in the atmosphere. The increasing fossil fuel emissions indicated by the depletion of 14CO2 under IPCC RCP scenarios, support the urgent need to devise ambitious strategies of reducing carbonaceous components to achieve sustainable development on Earth. This review summarizes the challenges and perspectives of 14C studies of the atmosphere.","","article","","1","","","Radiocarbon isotope technique as a powerful tool in tracking anthropogenic emissions of carbonaceous air pollutants and greenhouse gases: A review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667325821000595","2667-3258","2021","306-316","Fundamental Research"

Tree-ring chronologies from extreme cliff sites may also contain annually resolved and accurately dated information to facilitate the development of palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Complex and spatiotemporally inconsistent relationships between biotic and abiotic factors, however, often complicate our understanding of forest growth dynamics. In this study, we utilized a novel ensemble approach of 3240 growth–climate interactions to evaluate the likelihood of temporal fluctuations in the hydroclimatic sensitivity of three newly developed tree-ring width chronologies from 515 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). The data represent undisturbed cliff habitats across the northwestern Carpathian arc between 700 and 1050m asl. These sites are located in the northern (N) and southern (S) Tatra Mountains and in-between (M). Two sites (N, S) share common interannual to multi-decadal ring width variability (r=0.73), and they significantly capture variations in 20th-century summer drought conditions (r=0.52–0.65). Temporal instability in the growth–climate response, however, occurred in all three tree-ring chronologies, thus challenging any possible palaeoclimatic value. Orographic-induced climatology was found to dominate the observed growth–climate inconsistency, whereas age-related physiological mechanisms and differences in the absolute growth levels of the trees, as well as methodological standardization constraints and seasonal climate differences appeared to be less important. Our results suggest that environmental and ecological site criteria should be routinely supplemented by statistical data assessments prior to employing tree-ring chronologies for climate reconstructions.","","article","","160","","","Ensemble estimates reveal a complex hydroclimatic sensitivity of pine growth at Carpathian cliff sites","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192312000767","0168-1923","2012","100-109","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology"

Model runs were performed for six different values of the sea roughness model parameter, being proven, among others, to significantly affect the evolution of sea surface heat fluxes. The simulation justified the crucial role of sea surface heat fluxes in explosive cyclogenesis in the eastern Mediterranean by influencing the cyclone deepening rates and the respective minimum values of mean seal level pressure. The smaller values of the sea roughness parameter as compared to the default model value (equal to 20), leads to significant enhancement of the simulated sea surface heat fluxes and in turn produces higher deepening rates during the explosive deepening period. For both cases, the evaluation of the simulated mean sea level pressure values against observations demonstrated that values 10 and 1 better simulated the evolution of the mean sea level pressure along the cyclonic tracks.

Two major paleoenvironmental stages were inferred from the combined analysis of elemental, molecular and isotopic biomarkers, with a boundary or transition set at about 3200 yr BP. The first stage was characterized by a relatively low allochthonous organic content, reduced productivity and nitrogen levels. Such paleoenvironmental conditions are interpreted as a terrestrial system under periglacial influence, where material influx was related to erosion process from the melt water discharge, because of the proximity to the Collins Glacier ice cap. After the major Holocene glacier advance dated at about 3500 yr BP, the ice cap retreat led to the formation of Lake Uruguay, which involved in filling processes leading to moraine deposits, proglacial meltwater channels, and lakes next to the land glacier. During the second stage, with the onset of the Current Warm Period, prior to 1900 CE the stabilization of the Zr/Rb ratio within the laminated sediments documented the origin of the lacustrine sedimentation system, with subsequent increases in the sedimentation rate and biomass content (total nitrogen and organic carbon). Time series analyses revealed that the lake displayed variability cycles related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as reflected by high resolution sedimentological proxies for grain size, weathering, allochthonous inputs from the watershed, increase of biomass and productivity, and changes in redox conditions, all of which displayed similar oscillation cycles from 2 to 6 yr. During this periglacial recession and associated eutrophication process, we detected a striking loss in both bacterial specific richness and diversity as inferred from preliminary selected ancient DNA analyses.

Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1×106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very high-resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at large-scale for 2001–2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158ha, 2001–2019: 66,699ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatio-temporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models.","","article","","268","","","Remote sensing annual dynamics of rapid permafrost thaw disturbances with LandTrendr","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425721004727","0034-4257","2022","112752","Remote Sensing of Environment"

PM10 levels and chemical composition were separated by Atlantic (ATL) and NAF air masses. An increase in the average PM10 concentrations was observed on sampling days with NAF dust influence (42 μg m−3) when compared to ATL air masses (29 μg m−3). Major compounds such as crustal components and secondary inorganic compounds (SIC), as well as toxic trace elements derived from industrial emissions, also showed higher concentrations of NAF events. A source contribution analysis using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) 5.0 of the PM10 chemical data, discriminating ATL and NAF air mass origins, allowed the identification of five sources: crustal, sea salt, traffic, regional, and industrial. A higher contribution (74%) of the natural sources to PM10 concentrations was confirmed under NAF episodes compared with ATL. Furthermore, there was an increase in anthropogenic sources during these events (51%), indicating the important influence of the NAF air masses on these sources.

However, complex interactions within the shelf seas hinder the identification and unambiguous attribution of observed changes to drivers. These include variability in the climate system, in ocean dynamics, in biogeochemistry, and in shelf sea resource exploitation in the widest sense by societies. Observational time series are commonly too short, and resolution, integration time, and complexity of models are often insufficient to unravel natural variability from anthropogenic perturbation. The North Sea is a shelf sea of the North Atlantic and is impacted by virtually all global and regional developments. Natural variability (from interannual to multidecadal time scales) as response to forcing in the North Atlantic is overlain by global trends (sea level, temperature, acidification) and alternating phases of direct human impacts and attempts to remedy those. Human intervention started some 1000years ago (diking and associated loss of wetlands), expanded to near-coastal parts in the industrial revolution of the mid-19th century (river management, waste disposal in rivers), and greatly accelerated in the mid-1950s (eutrophication, pollution, fisheries). The North Sea is now a heavily regulated shelf sea, yet societal goals (good environmental status versus increased uses), demands for benefits and policies diverge increasingly. Likely, the southern North Sea will be re-zoned as riparian countries dedicate increasing sea space for offshore wind energy generation — with uncertain consequences for the system's environmental status. We review available observational and model data (predominantly from the southeastern North Sea region) to identify and describe effects of natural variability, of secular changes, and of human impacts on the North Sea ecosystem, and outline developments in the next decades in response to environmental legislation, and in response to increased use of shelf sea space.","","article","","141","","","The North Sea — A shelf sea in the Anthropocene","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796314000724","0924-7963","2015","18-33","Journal of Marine Systems"

Characterization may enable discrimination between permitted contents in commerce and contraband (explosives, illegal drugs, and the like). Our Multi-Mode Passive Detection System (MMPDS) relies primarily on the muon component of cosmic rays to interrogate Volumes of Interest (VOI). Muons, highly energetic and massive, pass essentially un-scattered through materials of light atomic mass and are only weakly scattered by conventional metals used in industry. Substantial scattering and absorption only occur when muons encounter sufficient thicknesses of heavy elements characteristic of lead and SNM. Electrons are appreciably scattered by light elements and stopped by sufficient thicknesses of materials containing medium-atomic-mass elements (mostly metals). Data include simulations based upon GEANT and measurements in the HMT (Half Muon Tracker) detector in Poway, CA and a package scanner in both Poway and Socorro NM. A key aspect of the present work is development of a useful parameter, designated the “stopping power” of a sample. The low-density regime, comprising organic materials up to aluminum, is characterized using very little scattering but a strong variation in stopping power. The medium-to-high density regime shows a larger variation in scattering than in stopping power. The detection of emitted gamma rays is another useful signature of some materials.","","article","","784","","","Material discrimination using scattering and stopping of cosmic ray muons and electrons: Differentiating heavier from lighter metals as well as low-atomic weight materials","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900214013151","0168-9002","2015","352-358","Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment"

Retreat of ice sheets/glaciers is due to increased melting in many regions of the cryosphere. Active microwave sensors are frequently used to detect surface melting because of their sensitivity to the liquid water presence in snow/ice. We mapped the annual melt duration and summer melt onset for the Svalbard archipelago using microwave scatterometers flown on QuikSCAT, OSCAT, ASCAT, and OSCAT-2, providing one of the longest continuous records of radar backscatter to estimate snowmelt onset and melt duration on Svalbard spanning 2000–17. A single threshold-based model was used to detect the timing of snowmelt; the threshold was calculated using meteorological data from manned weather stations. The results capture the timing and extent of melt events caused by warm air temperature and precipitation, as a consequence of the influx of moist, mild air from the Norwegian and Barents seas. The highest melt duration and earlier melt onset occurred in southernmost and western Svalbard, in response to the influence of the warm West Spitsbergen Current. Compared to earlier studies, we found considerable interannual variability and regional differences. Though the record is short, there is an indication of an increasing trend in total days of melt duration and earlier summer melt onset date, possibly linked to the general warming trend. Climate indices such as Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation are well correlated with onset melt and duration across Svalbard. With the reported year-after-year decrease in sea ice cover over the Arctic Ocean, the trend toward longer snowmelt duration inferred from this study is expected to enhance the Arctic amplification.","","incollection","Elsevier","","Understanding Present and Past Arctic Environments","978-0-12-822869-2","Chapter 13 - Spatiotemporal variability of snowmelt onset across Svalbard inferred from scatterometer data (2000–2017)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128228692000098","","2021","269-299",""

Reproduction is understood here as the ability to determine the magnetic anomaly of the local Earth magnetic field in any direction and at any measurement depth due to the presence of the analysed object. The B-91 type hydrographic ship Zodiak was selected as the real case study. The work was divided into two main stages: the development of a measurement campaign taking into account physical measurements, and the development of a mathematical model on the basis of the measured values. The measurement campaign included: preparation of the measuring range, selection of equipment for the measurement of magnetic quantities and geographical location, and data recording while the ship passes the measuring point according to the designated course. As a result of the measurement campaign, magnetic flux density components were collected in different positions in relation to the measuring instruments and the ship's heading. A multi-dipole model was used to build the mathematical model in accordance with the idea of inverse modelling. The effectiveness of this model was previously checked on synthetic data of virtual ships generated using the finite element method. Experiments performed with simulation models were helpful in determining the structure of the model, the nature of the data, and the number of samples needed to properly determine the multi-dipole model parameters. The parameters were determined using the nonlinear least squares method according to the idea of data fitting. The classical Ridge and Lasso regularization methods were applied to prevent the developed multi-dipole model from overfitting. Other regularization methods based on GPS accuracy marks and modification of fitness functions were also considered. The verification was done using real data: the data generated by the model was compared with patterns recorded during the Zodiak measurement campaign. High degree of conformity of the shape of characteristics was obtained. Moreover, the correctness of model execution was confirmed by low values of quantitative indices such as RMSE and MAE representing modelling errors. The methodology presented in the paper is quite universal and can be used to determine the signatures of other ferromagnetic objects.","","article","","186","","","Measurement campaign and mathematical model construction for the ship Zodiak magnetic signature reproduction","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224121009842","0263-2241","2021","110059","Measurement"

The filament dynamics and potential impact on the cross-shelf exchange budget are investigated based on a combined use of remote sensing imagery, in situ data and numerical modelling. The complexity of these phenomena is shown by focusing on four distinct events that led to cross-shelf transport, each representative of a different dynamic process and a distinct expected impact on the coastal area. A systematic analysis of available observations for the years 1998–2006 underlines the role of the interplay of atmospheric freshwater fluxes, river loads and wind stress variations, which may create favourable conditions for the convergence of shelf waters (particularly at coastal capes) and the subsequent formation of short-lived filaments along the coast. The response of the buoyant coastal waters to periods of wind reversal and fluctuating freshwater discharge rates is examined through idealised Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations. The filaments observed in remote sensing imagery were well reproduced by the numerical exercise, where the filaments appear as organised submesoscale structures that possess high relative vorticity and develop at the river mouths or adjacent capes. In both scenarios, the filaments appear largely determined by (i) the presence of a buoyancy anomaly, (ii) the angle between the wind pulse direction and the coast and (iii) irregularities in the coastal profile. The ensemble of results suggests that the occurrence of such transient, intense structures may contribute considerably to the biological variability and cross-shelf exchange in coastal areas with similar traits.","","article","","106","","","Filament formation and evolution in buoyant coastal waters: Observation and modelling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661112000912","0079-6611","2012","118-137","Progress in Oceanography"

The former warming was concentrated mostly in high latitudes, in contrast to the recent 30-year warming, which has occurred in all latitudes. Several explanations have been proposed; however, one of these proposed explanations, single external forcing, which could once explain the global average, failed to explain the early 20th century scenario. A second possible explanation was internal atmospheric variability with low frequency. Another candidate for the explanation was still forcing by black carbon deposited on snow and ice surfaces. The answer is most likely to be a combination of intrinsic internal natural climate variability and positive feedbacks that amplified the radiative and atmospheric forcing.

Analytical results for Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Li, F, Nb, Sn, Ti, Zr, Rb, Th, Sb, As, W and Au confirm that most known mineral deposits and metallogenic domains in the Meguma Zone have detectable geochemical signatures in lake sediments. Lake sediment exploration is most effective for mapping when a catchment basin model is employed. In southern Nova Scotia, lake sediment surveys are especially useful when prospecting and selecting areas of potential lithophile mineralization. Mineralogical expressions of Sn, W, Th and Zr in lake sediment are reflected by the presence of discrete grains of cassiterite, scheelite or wolframite, monazite and zircon. Free gold has also been identified in lake sediment, and may be the cause of some identified Au anomalies. Lake catchment basins contain mixtures of hydromorphically and mechanically dispersed components. After relatively short transport distances from a bedrock or till source heavy minerals can be trapped in lake catchment basins. Meguma Zone lake sediment anomalies may be grouped into those dominated by these hydromorphic and mechanical-weathering processes. Geochemical mapping using lake sediments is undertaken through the application of simple data reduction procedures using single- and multi-element methods. Geochemical maps for individual elements are produced as computer-contoured colour plots at a fixed percentile scale. Maps for Sn, W, Au and Ag outline known mineral occurrences as distinct anomalies for the East Kemptville Sn-Zn-Cu ± W, Millet Brook U-Cu-Ag and numerous Au vein deposits within defined bedrock metallogenic domains. Geochemical mapping of Au and Ag anomalies also indicates large-scale structures such as northwesterly trending shear zones. Large shear zones are outlined by Au anomalies, and W highs define areas of new potential in exo-contact zones of the South Mountain Batholith. Gold potential for granitoid rocks is indicated by numerous Au anomalies. Associations of Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag, F-Li-Nb-Rb + Sn, Zr-Ti-Th and Sb-As-Au-W are plotted with multi-element score maps. Boundaries of the score maps closely follow the bedrock metallogenic domains and outline areas of potential economic mineralization. Regional geochemical mapping can be accomplished successfully, accurately and at reasonable cost using lake sediments. Modern analytical packages offer high-precision techniques for lake sediment analysis. Compared to regional till surveys in this area, lake sediment surveys cost less and have spatial attributes that produce data more suited to geochemical mapping projects.","","article","","39","","","Metallogenic domains and their reflection in regional lake sediment surveys from the Meguma Zone, southern Nova Scotia, Canada","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037567429090072I","0375-6742","1990","153-174","Journal of Geochemical Exploration"

By virtue of their sensitivity and specificity, diatoms are ideal for examining past changes in aquatic ecosystems and deciphering the ranges of variability under natural and human-induced conditions. To date, however, very few fossils diatom studies have examined in detail the environmental evolution during the last millennium throughout Patagonia. Here we present a fine-resolution diatom record from a lake-sediment core collected from Lago Pichilaguna (41°S), a closed-basin and shallow lake with a small catchment area located in the lowlands of the Chilean Lake District in NWP. The record spans the last millennium with a median time resolution of ∼12 years between samples, and shows abundant small Aulacoseira spp. between ∼1000-900 and ∼600-300 cal yr BP, which alternate in dominance with small fragilarioids and small raphid diatoms between ∼900-600 and ∼300-200 cal yr BP. A rapid shift to planktonic diatoms started at ∼200 cal yr BP and led to their modern dominance. We interpret centennial-scale changes in temperature, precipitation, and lake turbulence, with warm/dry/stratified phases between ∼1000-900 and ∼600-300 cal yr BP related to weak westerly winds, and intervals of cold/wet and mixed water column conditions between ∼900-600 and ∼300-200 cal yr BP, favored by stronger winds. The transition from periphytic to planktonic diatoms that started at ∼200 cal yr BP suggests juxtaposition of the warmest/driest phase of the last millennium and the onset of large-scale disturbance by Chilean/European settlers in NWP. Our results reveal that human disturbance during historical time surpassed the natural ranges of variability and resilience of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems over the last millennium, generating abrupt changes in biodiversity, species composition, and community structure.","","article","","296","","","The last millennium viewed from a fine-resolution freshwater diatom record from northwestern Patagonia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379122004371","0277-3791","2022","107806","Quaternary Science Reviews"

This first article presents a survey of conventional methods of operations of spacecraft constellations, investigates its scalability for growing number of spacecraft, and identifies operational paradigm shifts. The second article focuses on the classification of distributed satellite systems and evaluates commercial tools for automated spacecraft operations. The trend of using distributed space systems such as satellite constellation instead of monolithic systems has been growing in the last decade. Recently, a variety of large satellite constellations were announced and the production of some has started. Several of these announced constellations feature more than 1000 satellites. While the “mass production” of satellites is feasible and has already started, there are no effective solutions existing for the “mass operations” of satellites. In some instances, conventional spacecraft operations involve manual control by skilled human operators, following at least a 4-eyes principle. Even when operators batch multiple telecommands together, the scheduling process is still challenging for growing spacecraft numbers. This approach is not (linearly) scalable to large satellite constellations: new operational methods need to be established and the automation level of the constellation increased. To motivate the research activities in this framework and pave the way for automated management of large distributed satellite systems, this paper gives an overview of some conventional methods of spacecraft operations. From this description, the weakness areas in terms of scalability are deduced, identifying potential bottlenecks for the operations of such systems.

Using a regionally restricted randomization test reflecting the south to north intensification of the SOD epidemic in Oregon, we assessed if the movement of P. ramorum between sites was spatially dependant upon roads and streams, topographic features associated with the landscape-scale movement of soil and water borne inoculum of related Phytophthora spp. Dissimilar to other forest Phytophthora spp. we found no association between SOD sites and the road network.

Identifying the level of operation of the remote management system is an essential step to understand better the functionality of the remote control and monitoring system and define the objectives to be met and the technical specifications necessary for its implementation.

Here we assess, from up-to-date and long-term observations, the SO2 emission of the Ambrym volcano, one of the dominant volcanoes in the MVA, and we investigate its role as sulfate precursor on the regional distribution of aerosols, using both satellite observations and model results at 1°×1° spatial resolution from WRF-Chem/GOCART. Without considering aerosol forcing on clouds, our model parameterizations for convection, vertical mixing and cloud properties provide a reliable chemical weather representation, making possible a cross-examination of model solution and observations. This preliminary work enables the identification of biases and limitations affecting both the model (missing sources) and satellite sensors and algorithms (for aerosol detection and classification) and leads to the implementation of improved transport and aerosol processes in the modeling system. On the one hand, the model confirms a 50% underestimation of SO2 emissions due to satellite swath sampling of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), consistent with field studies. The OMI irregular sampling also produces a level of noise that impairs its monitoring capacity during short-term volcanic events. On the other hand, the model reveals a large sensitivity on aerosol composition and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) due to choices of both the source function in WRF-Chem and size parameters for sea-salt in FlexAOD, the post-processor used to compute offline the simulated AOD. We then proceed to diagnosing the role of SO2 volcanic emission in the regional aerosol composition. The model shows that both dynamics and cloud properties associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) have a large influence on the oxidation of SO2 and on the transport pathways of volcanic species across the South Pacific atmosphere. For example, in the tropical cloudy air, the sulfate production in the aqueous phase is very efficient, resulting in the formation of a large cloud of highly scattering sulfate aerosols advected horizontally to Eastern Indonesia, in agreement with the AOD feature captured by MODIS/Aqua, but missed in CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar) products. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that aerosol re-suspension due to evaporating droplets is a significant pathway for the supply of volcanic sulfur species in the remote marine boundary layer. By strongly modulating the irreversible loss due to wet scavenging, this aerosol process has a similar influence on the sulfur burden as natural emission from volcanoes or biogenic sources like dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The results emphasize the importance of MVA passive degassing and SPCZ dynamics on the aerosol background, and raise questions about potential impacts on the local climate and marine ecosystems.","","article","","322","","","Distribution of sulfur aerosol precursors in the SPCZ released by continuous volcanic degassing at Ambrym, Vanuatu","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027315002267","0377-0273","2016","76-104","Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research"

However, in areas such as ports or bridges, the GNSS signal will be occluded or weakened. The carrier frequency and code frequency of scalar tracking (ST) in GNSS receiver fluctuates greatly, and even the tracking loop will lose lock. To enhance the navigation performance of USV's GNSS receiver, this paper proposes a framework that uses fixed-lag smoothing (FLS) to assist vector tracking (VT) and applies unscented Kalman filter in the navigation processor. The pseudo-range error and pseudo-range rate error are used as the measurements of navigation processor. FLS serves as a backward filter to enhance the tracking ability of the code loop. The field experiments show that the positioning error of the proposed method is reduced by 72.1% compared to the traditional VT method in the open-sky environments. When the signal is occluded, the positioning results of the traditional ST are dispersed, and also the traditional VT method displays a large error. Moreover, the proposed method is able to reduce the positioning error by 85.4%.

Collision avoidance is one of the most critical tasks that autonomous ships must handle. To support the level of safety associated with collision avoidance, this study suggests to provide autonomous ships with the ability to conduct proactive collision avoidance maneuvers. Proactive collision avoidance entails predicting future encounter situations, such that they can preemptively be avoided. However, any such actions must adhere to relevant navigation rules and regulations. As such, it is suggested to predict encounter situations far in advance, i.e. prior to risk of collision existing. Any actions can, therefore, be conducted prior to the applicability of the COLREGs. As such, simple corrective measures, e.g. minor speed and/or heading alterations, can prevent close encounter situations from arising, reducing the overall risk associated with autonomous ship operations, as well as improving traffic flow. This study suggests to facilitate this ability by emulating the development of situation awareness in ship navigators through machine learning. By leveraging historical AIS data to serve as artificial navigational experience, long-range trajectory predictions can be facilitated in a similar manner those conducted by human navigators, where such predictions provide the basis for proactive collision avoidance actions. The development of human situation awareness is, therefore, presented, and relevant machine learning techniques are discussed to emulate the same mechanisms.","","article","","54","","","Proactive Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Ships: Leveraging Machine Learning to Emulate Situation Awareness","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896321014695","2405-8963","2021","16-23","IFAC-PapersOnLine"

Based on the results of LDA, we quantify the similarity of journals and countries/regions in terms of their aggregated topic distributions. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we find some general research trends, such as topics on sustainability, travel behavior and non-motorized mobility are becoming increasingly popular over time. We also carry out this temporal analysis for each journal, observing a high degree of consistency for most journals. However, some interesting anomaly, such as special issues on particular topics, are detected from temporal variation as well. By quantifying the temporal trends at the country/region level, we find that countries/regions display clearly distinguishable patterns, suggesting that research communities in different regions tend to focus on different sub-fields.

The ENM was built bridging knowledge on ecological traits of ABFT (e.g. temperature tolerance, mobility, feeding and spawning strategy) with patterns of selected environmental variables (chlorophyll-a fronts and concentration, sea surface current and temperature, sea surface height anomaly) that were identified using an extensive set of precisely geo-located presence data. The results highlight a wider temperature tolerance for larger fish allowing them to feed in the northern – high chlorophyll levels – latitudes up to the Norwegian Sea in the eastern Atlantic and to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the western basin. Permanent suitable feeding habitat for small ABFT was predicted to be mostly located in temperate latitudes in the North Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in subtropical waters off north-west Africa, while summer potential habitat in the Gulf of Mexico was found to be unsuitable for both small and large ABFTs. Potential spawning grounds were found to occur in the Gulf of Mexico from March–April in the south-east to April–May in the north, while favourable conditions evolve in the Mediterranean Sea from mid-May in the eastern to mid-July in the western basin. Other secondary potential spawning grounds not supported by observations were predicted in the Azores area and off Morocco to Senegal during July and August when extrapolating the model settings from the Gulf of Mexico into the North Atlantic. The presence of large ABFT off Florida and the Bahamas in spring was not explained by the model as is, however the environmental variables other than the sea surface height anomaly appeared to be favourable for spawning in part of this area.

Two sediment cores were extracted from Robinson Lake and were dated by 210Pb and 14C methods, and analyzed for organic matter content, sediment grain size, and a range of elements and elemental ratios determined by XRF core scanning. A distinct sand layer in the most recent sediments is attributed to Hurricane Juan, which struck the coast of Nova Scotia on September 29, 2003. Our study shows that peaks in grain size farther down-core are generally correlated with abrupt increases in Br and Br/Ti. XRF-derived Br measurements are an indicator of marine organic carbon (MOC), and the increases in Br likely reflect incursions of marine water and nutrients into the lake as a result of storm surges.

Cutis laxa includes a family of clinically overlapping conditions with confusing nomenclature, generally requiring molecular analyses for definitive diagnosis. Six genes are currently known to mutate to yield one of these related conditions. We ascertained a cohort of typical ARCL2 patients from a subpopulation isolate within eastern Canada. Homozygosity mapping with high-density SNP genotyping excluded all six known genes, and instead identified a single homozygous region near the telomere of chromosome 17, shared identically by state by all genotyped affected individuals from the families. A putative pathogenic variant was identified by direct DNA sequencing of genes within the region. The single nucleotide change leads to a missense mutation adjacent to a splice junction in the gene encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1). Bioinformatic analysis predicted a pathogenic effect of the variant on splice donor site function. Skipping of the associated exon was confirmed in RNA from blood lymphocytes of affected homozygotes and heterozygous mutation carriers. Exon skipping leads to deletion of the reductase functional domain-coding region and an obligatory downstream frameshift. PYCR1 plays a critical role in proline biosynthesis. Pathogenicity of the genetic variant in PYCR1 is likely, given that a similar clinical phenotype has been documented for mutation carriers of another proline biosynthetic enzyme, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase. Our results support a significant role for proline in normal development.","","article","","85","","","Mutation in Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Reductase 1 Gene in Families with Cutis Laxa Type 2","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929709002444","0002-9297","2009","120-129","The American Journal of Human Genetics"

Such work had as reference scenario the linear causal chain MCTP (Macroscale Circulation→Temperature→Phenology of crops) that links oceanic and atmospheric circulation to surface air temperature which in its turn determines the earliness of appearance of phenological phases of plants. Results show that in the three segments of the MCTP causal chain are present cycles with the following central period in years (the % of the 12 analyzed time series interested by these cycles are in brackets): 65 (58%), 24 (58%), 20.5 (58%), 13.5 (50%), 11.5 (58%), 7.7 (75%), 5.5 (58%), 4.1 (58%), 3 (50%), 2.4 (67%). A comparison with short term spectral peaks of the four El Niño regions (nino1+2, nino3, nino3.4 and nino4) show that 10 of the 12 series are imprinted by periods around 2.3–2.4yr while 50–58% of the series are imprinted by El Niño periods of 4–4.2, 3.8–3.9, 3–3.1years. The analysis highlights the links among physical and biological variables of the climate system at scales that range from macro to microscale whose knowledge is crucial to reach a suitable understanding of the ecosystem behavior. The spectral analysis was also applied to a time series of spring – summer precipitation in order to evaluate the presence of peaks common with other 12 selected series with result substantially negative which brings us to rule out the existence of a linear causal chain MCPP (Macroscale Circulation→Precipitation→Phenology).","","article","","593-594","","","Multi-scale approach to Euro-Atlantic climatic cycles based on phenological time series, air temperatures and circulation indexes","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717307052","0048-9697","2017","253-262","Science of The Total Environment"

In a recently deglaciated environment, distinguishing between shifts in active braid plain location, considered reversible by fluvial processes at short timescales, and more permanent glacier-conditioned changes in stream position can be critical to understanding flood hazards. Between 2009 and 2014, increased spilling from the Exit Creek braid plain in Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska, repeatedly overtopped the only access road to the popular Exit Glacier visitor facilities and trails. To understand the likely cause of road flooding, we consider recent processes and the interplay between glacier and fluvial system dynamics since the maximum advance of the Little Ice Age, around 1815. Patterns of temperature and precipitation, the variables that drive high streamflow via snowmelt, glacier meltwater runoff, and rainfall, could not fully explain the timing of road floods. Comparison of high-resolution topographic data between 2008 and 2012 showed a strong pattern of braid plain aggradation along 3km of glacier foreland, not unexpected at the base of mountainous glaciers and likely an impetus for channel migration. Historically, a dynamic zone follows the retreating glacier in which channel positions shift rapidly in response to changes in the glacier margin and fresh morainal deposits. This period of paraglacial adjustment lasts one to several decades at Exit Glacier. Subsequently, as moraine breaches consolidate and lock the channel into position, and as the stream regains the lower-elevation valley center, upper-elevation surfaces are abandoned as terraces inaccessible by fluvial processes for timescales of decades to centuries. Where not constrained by these terraces and moraines, the channel is free to migrate, which in this aggradational setting generates an alluvial fan at the breach of the final prominent moraine. The position of this fan is glacially conditioned but the process of migration of the braided channels across it is not. This broad perspective on channel controls identifies incipient avulsion into the roadside forest as part of a long-term fan-building process independent from changes in streamflow or sediment load.","","article","","293","","","Glacial conditioning of stream position and flooding in the braid plain of the Exit Glacier foreland, Alaska","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X17302647","0169-555X","2017","272-288","Geomorphology"

Here we present a concept for global measurement of the true or “absolute” sea-level change, which combines recent advances in space-based geodetic techniques with plans for a global sea-level network under the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Data from initial feasibility tests show that land motion, due to global (plate tectonic), regional (glacial rebound), or local (fluid withdrawal) effects, can probably be measured to ±1cm (on a single measurement basis) by an innovative combination of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) tevhniques. By making repeated observations of position at a number of tide gauges using portable, economical GPS receivers in a differential mode relative to the fewer, more stable, but more expensive VLBI observatories, it will be possible to subtract land motion from the relative sea-level signal. Decadal to century scale trends at the 1–2mm y−1 level will be resolvable in the sea-level and vertical land motion time series within about a decade. Detection of subsidence or uplift at specific gauges will allow correction for land motion or deletion of bad data when computing regional or global, i.e. eustatic, sea-level changes. In addition to their applications in oceanography and climate studies, such data will test models by Peltier and other that relate mantle viscosity and deglaciation history to present rates of crustal subsidence or uplift. If the predicted crustal motions are confirmed, we can also have more confidence in the use of historical tide/sea-level gauge records in retrospective studies of sea-level change related to climate variability on decadal or longer time scales. It is concluded that as few as one-third (about 100) of the total number of tide/sea-level gauges (250–300) required for global climate research programmes (WYRTKI and PUGH, 1984) need to be upgraded to “sea-level observatory” status, in terms of sensors and geodetic control, to build a two tier sea-level network that will provide the data needed to solve many problems of both relative and absolute sea-level change. Such a network will provide basic information supporting research on a wide range of questions related to “global change”.","","article","","18","","","Global change and the measurement of absolute sea-level","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0079661187900231","0079-6611","1987","1-21","Progress in Oceanography"

Numerical simulations are forced by the output of regional climate simulations with RegCM3, which uses IPCC’s historical data on greenhouse gasses emissions for the (past) period 1951–2000, and IPCC’s A1B climate scenario for the (future) period 2001–2100. Comparisons between observations and modeling results show good agreement and confirm the ability of our model to estimate the response of the sea surface to future climatic conditions. We investigate the future trends, the variability and frequency of local extremes and the main forcing mechanisms that can induce strong surges in the Mediterranean region. Our results support that there is a general decreasing trend in storminess under the considered climate scenario, mostly related to the frequency of local peaks and the duration and spatial coverage of the storm surges. The northward shift in the location of storm tracks is a possible reason for this storminess attenuation, especially over areas where the main driving factor of extreme events is the inverted barometer effect. However, the magnitudes of sea surface elevation extremes may increase in several Mediterranean sub-regions, i.e., Southern Adriatic, Balearic and Tyrrhenian Seas, during the 21st century. There are clear distinctions in the contributions of winds and pressure fields to the sea level height for various regions of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as on the seasonal variability of extreme values; the Aegean and Adriatic Seas are characteristic examples, where high surges are predicted to be mainly induced by low pressure systems and favorable winds, respectively.","","article","","71","","","Storm surges in the Mediterranean Sea: Variability and trends under future climatic conditions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377026515000287","0377-0265","2015","56-82","Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans"

Rainwater samples from eight sites show that pH is consistently between 4.0 and 5.0, and confirms previous observations of the widespread occurrence of acidic rainwater across the northern parts of Australia. Measurements of anions (sulfate, nitrate, chloride, phosphate) and weak organic acids (formate and acetate) in rainfall, together with pH and conductivity, have shown the presence of local concentrations of ions and the presence of free acidity in excess of that attributed to dissolved carbon dioxide. Much of the acidity was associated with the presence of weak acids; for example, for all Magela samples 47% was weak acids compared with 25.5, 13 and 8% for hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric acids, respectively. Acidity due to sulfate was therefore low, but sulfate in excess of that derived from sea-salt was of large magnitude; for example, 83% of sulfate for all Magela samples was excess. Possible sources of acidity are natural (burning of vegetation, soil dust, lightning, biogenic emissions from soils and oceans and volcanoes), and anthropogenic (sulfuric acid plant and electricity generating stations and minor emissions from calciners and sulfuric acid aerosols in open vats locally at Jabiru and nearby Nabarlek). The impact of sulfur emissions from the Ranger uranium mine/mill complex (sulfuric acid plant and electricity generating station) on rainwater acidity in the surrounding Jabiru area was examined, but the fate of the sulfur dioxide emissions was not known. Difficulties in establishing the significance of contributions from anthropogenic sources against this background of natural acidity are attributed to a lack of information on the proportions of chloride, sulfate and nitrate from these sources.","","article","","91","","","Chemical composition and acidity of rainfall in the Alligator Rivers Region, Northern Territory, Australia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969790902864","0048-9697","1990","23-48","Science of The Total Environment"

The ability of the upwelling to trigger phytoplankton blooms via upward nitrate flux from the halocline is then investigated using data from a moored array together with the proxy. The 70-year record of wind speed from the Barrow, Alaska meteorological station (1941–2010) reveals that strong upwelling events – lasting at least 4 days and exceeding 10m/s during the storm – occur throughout the year. On average there are 9–10 upwelling events per year, and the number and strength of events has increased over the last 25 years. The low-frequency variability in the upwelling co-varies with previously documented Arctic climate trends, but there is no significant correlation with various high latitude atmospheric indices. There are two seasonal peaks in the occurrence of upwelling, in May and November. The role of the Beaufort High and Aleutian Low in driving the upwelling is investigated using NCEP reanalysis fields. Fluctuations in both of these centers of action contribute to the enhanced winds, and the location of the Aleutian Low storm track plays a key role in the seasonal variability of the upwelling. The upward nitrate flux due to storms in the open water period can account for new primary production that is on par with carbon fixed during the summer growing season in the absence of storms. Evidence from satellite ocean color data of such wind-induced phytoplankton blooms is presented.","","article","","79","","","Long-term trends of upwelling and impacts on primary productivity in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063713000939","0967-0637","2013","106-121","Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers"

One of these stations, the 15-m antenna facility at Carnarvon, West Australia, was designed and installed by ESA as a dedicated S-band and X-band tracking, telemetry and command station. The second station at Parkes, New South Wales, Australia, a 64-m radio telescope owned by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) was modified to provide X-band telemetry reception using cryogenic MASER low-noise amplifiers. This station operated by CSIRO with assistance from a ESA engineering and operations team, provided support to the GIOTTO mission for reception of the 46 kbs high speed telemetry format which is vital to success of the GIOTTO mission at time of Cometary Encounter. Additionally, the DFVLR Weilheim station was modified to include the newly developed ESOC deep space tracking system which was also installed at the Carnarvon Station. The paper discusses in some detail the network of tracking stations which provided the Control Centre at ESOC in Darmstadt, F.R.G. with the data which was vital to the success of the mission. Because the launch date of GIOTTO was a date which could not be rescheduled, the design installation, integration and testing of the complete GIOTTO mission operations system was an extremely time critical activity. Without the “ground segment” in a fully functional state, the launch of GIOTTO could not take place. The activities leading to the successful completion of the GIOTTO mission operations system are described in some detail with emphasis on the final testing carried out in early 1985. One important factor which is sometimes overlooked by authors describing the GIOTTO mission is that, whereas NASA has had for many years a world-wide deep space network available for its deep space missions, ESA had to start from scratch in its task of building a system capable of controlling the GIOTTO mission to Halley's Comet. The task of spacecraft operations can never be discussed separately from the system required to provide the necessary control of the mission. This paper will concentrate to some extent in this aspect as experienced during the flight to the comet and the rendezvous on the night of 13 March 1986.","","article","","17","","","Giotto—The mission operations system","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0094576588900720","0094-5765","1988","1033-1043","Acta Astronautica"

During the last decade, there has been a growing focus of research in the UAV's assistance paradigm as a fundamental concept resulting in the constant improvement between different kinds of ground networks and the hovering UAVs in the sky. Recently, the wide availability of embedded wireless interfaces in the communicating entities has allowed the deployment of such a paradigm simpler and easiest. Moreover, due to UAVs' controlled mobility and adjustable altitudes, they can be considered as the most appropriate candidate to enhance the performance and overcome the restrictions of ground networks. This comprehensive survey both studies and summarizes the existing UAV-assisted research, such as routing, data gathering, cellular communications, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and disaster management that supports existing enabling technologies. Descriptions, classifications, and comparative studies related to different UAV-assisted proposals are presented throughout the paper. By pointing out numerous future challenges, it is expected to simulate research in this emerging and hot research area. To the best of our knowledge, there are many survey papers on the topic from a technology perspective. Nevertheless, this survey can be considered as the first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of different types of existing UAV-assisted networks and describes the state-of-the-art in UAV-assisted research.","","article","","166","","","UAV assistance paradigm: State-of-the-art in applications and challenges","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804520301806","1084-8045","2020","102706","Journal of Network and Computer Applications"

Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After designing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS + A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA).","","article","","95","","","Global navigation satellite systems performance analysis and augmentation strategies in aviation","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037604211730163X","0376-0421","2017","45-98","Progress in Aerospace Sciences"

We discuss downcore variations of compositional data of two sediment cores from the northern and southern Scotia Sea that correlate with fluctuations in magnetic susceptibility. Sediments were derived from very different sources at both localities, as revealed by contrasting clay-mineral assemblages. However, a common feature is the input of more basic and undifferentiated crustal material with the potential of high magnetic susceptibility during glacial periods, indicated by variable quartz/feldspar ratios and major, trace and rare earth elements. Terrigenous sediments mainly originate from nearby terrestrial sources or are introduced through interbasinal sediment transfer from adjacent seas. The observed temporal compositional variations have to be attributed to changes in the relative detrital contributions from the diverse source areas. Ice-mass extensions in southern Patagonia, on the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands likely control the supply of glaciogenic detritus to the open ocean during times of glacial expansion, diluting the sediment input of interbasinal origin. Current transport is mainly responsible for sediment dispersal to the pelagic Scotia Sea and may amplify the glaciological source signals during glacial climate periods, because of a stronger wind forcing of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.","","article","","162","","","Terrigenous sediment supply in the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean): response to Late Quaternary ice dynamics in Patagonia and on the Antarctic Peninsula","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018200001383","0031-0182","2000","357-387","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

Collaboration between climate and LMR scientists and shared understanding of critical challenges for such applications are essential for developing robust projections of climate impacts on LMRs. This paper assesses present approaches for generating projections of climate impacts on LMRs using IPCC-class climate models, recommends practices that should be followed for these applications, and identifies priority developments that could improve current projections. Understanding of the climate system and its representation within climate models has progressed to a point where many climate model outputs can now be used effectively to make LMR projections. However, uncertainty in climate model projections (particularly biases and inter-model spread at regional to local scales), coarse climate model resolution, and the uncertainty and potential complexity of the mechanisms underlying the response of LMRs to climate limit the robustness and precision of LMR projections. A variety of techniques including the analysis of multi-model ensembles, bias corrections, and statistical and dynamical downscaling can ameliorate some limitations, though the assumptions underlying these approaches and the sensitivity of results to their application must be assessed for each application. Developments in LMR science that could improve current projections of climate impacts on LMRs include improved understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that link climate and LMRs and better representations of these mechanisms within more holistic LMR models. These developments require a strong baseline of field and laboratory observations including long time series and measurements over the broad range of spatial and temporal scales over which LMRs and climate interact. Priority developments for IPCC-class climate models include improved model accuracy (particularly at regional and local scales), inter-annual to decadal-scale predictions, and the continued development of earth system models capable of simulating the evolution of both the physical climate system and biosphere. Efforts to address these issues should occur in parallel and be informed by the continued application of existing climate and LMR models.","","article","","88","","","On the use of IPCC-class models to assess the impact of climate on Living Marine Resources","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661110001096","0079-6611","2011","1-27","Progress in Oceanography"

Meyerhoff","Surge-Tectonic Evolution of Southeastern Asia: A Geohydrodynamics Approach","","","","","3","","https://doi.org/10.1016/0743-9547(95)00028-3","The repeated need for ad hoc modifications in plate-tectonic models to explain the evolution of southeastern Asia reveals their inability to fully explain the complex features and dynamics of this region. As one example, the hypothesis does not provide a mechanism to explain the 180° turns and twists along the strike of several foldbelts and island arcs in the region (e.g. Banda arc). Convection-cell configuration renders such 180° contortions and Rayleigh-Bénard-type convection impossible. However, during the last 10 years, new data bearing on the convection-cell problem have become available in the form of seismotomographic images of the earth's interior. These images show that (i) mantle diapirs as proposed by traditional plate-tectonic models do not exist; (ii) there is no discernible pattern of upper or lower mantle convection, and thus no longer an adequate mechanism to move plates; and (iii) the lithosphere above a depth of about 80 km is permeated by an interconnected network of low-velocity channels. Seismic-reflection studies of the low-velocity channels discovered on the seismotomographic images reveal that these channels have walls with a 7.1–7.8 km s−1 P-wave velocity. Commonly, the interiors of the channels are acoustically transparent, with much slower P-wave velocities, in places as low as 5.4 km s−1. The author and co-workers have interpreted the low velocities as evidence for the presence of partial melt in the channels, and they postulated that this melt moves preferentially eastward as a result of the earth's rotation. They named these channels “surge channels” and their new hypothesis for earth dynamics “surge tectonics”. Surge channels underlie every type of tectonic belt, which includes mid-ocean ridges, aseismic ridges, continental rifts, strike-slip fracture zones, and foldbelts. In southeastern Asia, surge channels—mainly foldbelts—lie between all platform and cratonic massifs. These massifs, platforms, and tectonics belts—the surge channels—form an anastomosing E-W pattern southern Asiatic Russia, Mongolia, western China, the Qinghai-Tibetan region, and northern India and Pakistan. Such an anastomosing pattern indicates that flow is an active process in the surge channels. Surface studies of phenomena that might be associated with the surge channels soon revealed that all active channels are characterized by higher-than-normal heat flow (> 55 mW m−2, thermal springs and elevated ground-water temperatures, volvanic phenomena, bands of microearthquakes, and linear belts of faults, fractures, and fissures. The latter are especially visible on satellite images. The bands of high heat flow, thermal springs, microearthquakes, and faults-fractures-fissures almost exactly coincide. The fault-fracture-fissure systems are interpreted to be streamlines caused by flow in the surge channels—a consequence of Stokes's Law (an expression of Newton's Second Law of Motion)-and show that Poiseuille flow must dominate in the channels. Hence, the mechanism producing the belts of linear faults-fractures-fissures is viscous drag, produced by fluid motions. The eastward flow of the magma in the channels is demonstrated clearly in the tectonic patterns of southeastern Asia. In the northern part of the region studied, the E-W striking anastomosing surge channels (tectonic belts) splay northeastward into the coastal regions of Russia. In the south, they splay southward and southeastward through the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. The open horsetail structures thus created prove that flow is W-E. The presence of the two splay directions, NE and S-SE, indicates in addition that a barrier to eastward flow must lie directly east of Asia. In this author's opinion, this barrier is the existing Benioff zone, because the same NE and S-SE splay patterns are present on each of the paleotectonic maps that have been prepared for nine time intervals from the beginning of Sinian (latest Proterozoic) time to the present. The presence of the W-E flow patterns through 850 Ma of geological time, patterns that remain essentially unchanged, means simply that tectonic explanations of Asian geology need revision. The patterns that have been mapped indicate that W-E flow across Asia has persisted essentially unchanged for 850 Ma. Surge tectonics is the only hypothesis yet proposed that explains these patterns and their persistence.","","article","","12","","","Surge-tectonic evolution of southeastern Asia: a geohydrodynamics approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0743954795000283","0743-9547","1995","145-247","Journal of Southeast Asian Earth Sciences"

The first platform is a derivative of Surrey's UoSAT-12 minisatellite, launched in April 1999 and operating successfully in-orbit. The minisatellite has been modified to accommodate a propulsion system capable of delivering up to 1700 m/s delta-V, enabling it to support a wide range of very low cost missions to LaGrange points, Near-Earth Objects, and the Moon. A mission to the Moon - dubbed “MoonShine” - is proposed as the first demonstration of the modified minisatellite beyond LEO. The second platform - Surrey's Interplanetary Platform - has been designed to support missions with delta-V requirements up to 3200 m/s, making it ideal for low cost missions to Mars and Venus, as well as Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and other interplanetary trajectories. Analysis has proved mission feasibility, identifying key challenges in both missions for developing cost-effective techniques for: spacecraft propulsion; navigation; autonomous operations; and a reliable safe mode strategy. To reduce mission risk, inherently failure resistant lunar and interplanetary trajectories are under study. In order to significantly reduce cost and increase reliability, both platforms can communicate with low-cost ground stations and exploit Surrey's experience in autonomous operations. The lunar minisatellite can provide up to 70 kg payload margin in lunar orbit for a total mission cost US$16–25 M. The interplanetary platform can deliver 20 kg of scientific payload to Mars or Venus orbit for a mission cost US$25–50 M. Together, the platforms will enable regular flight of payloads to the Moon and interplanetary space at unprecedented low cost. This paper outlines key systems engineering issues for the proposed Lunar Minisatellite and interplanetary Platform Missions, and describes the accommodation and performance offered to planetary payloads.","","article","","48","","","Low cost planetary exploration: surrey lunar minisatellite and interplanetary platform missions","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576501000431","0094-5765","2001","669-680","Acta Astronautica"

Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks.

Here we report dissolved (<0.45μm) Fe and Al measurements collected during two high-resolution US-CLIVAR CO2 Repeat Hydrography sections, which transected the upper 1000m of the gyre zonally along ~32°S (I05) and meridionally along ~30°E (I06S). Particulate Fe and Al concentrations in waters influenced by the Agulhas Current are also presented. The distributions of dissolved Fe and Al in the gyre are primarily impacted by mineral dust deposition at the surface and the large-scale circulation patterns of the gyre at depth. Using mean mixed layer dissolved Al concentrations, we estimate that the deposition and partial dissolution of mineral dust emanating from South Africa and Australia vary from 60 to 685mg (dust) m−2yr−1 across the 32°S transect. This translates into a dust source of dissolved Fe ranging from 1.7 to 20μmolFem−2y−1. The zonal patterns of aeolian deposition and those of N*, an indirect geochemical tracer for nitrogen fixation, show remarkable similarities along the I05 transect, suggesting that aeolian delivery of Fe may regulate nitrogen fixation rates in the SISG. In the western SISG (west of 60°E), which receives some of the highest aeolian Fe fluxes of the 32°S section, the Fe:AOU ratio in Indian Central Water was elevated relative to that observed in the Indian Central Water occupying the eastern Indian Ocean. These elevated Fe:AOU ratios may reflect the remineralization of Fe-rich organic material from nitrogen fixing organisms at the western end of the basin. Below the mixed layer, the distribution of dissolved Al appears to trace the principal features of the large-scale circulation of the SISG. Elevated subsurface concentrations of dissolved Al (>4nM) in the southwest Indian Ocean west of 45–50°E are most likely sustained by leakage of Al-rich waters from the Agulhas Return Current. Along the southeast African margin, the elevated particulate Fe (up to 230nM) and Al (up to 690nM) concentrations reflect the resuspension and transport of shelf sediments by the highly energetic Agulhas Current. However, while the particulate inputs at the margin are massive and appear to supply modest amounts of dissolved Fe, the distribution of dissolved Al is decoupled from the particulate phase. This observation suggests that the elevated subsurface dissolved Al concentrations observed near the African shelf are not the result of sediment resuspension processes occurring in situ along I05 but are more likely an advected signal originating from the upper reaches of the Agulhas Current.","","article","","176","","","The impact of circulation and dust deposition in controlling the distributions of dissolved Fe and Al in the south Indian subtropical gyre","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420315300281","0304-4203","2015","110-125","Marine Chemistry"

Most studies of anthropogenic Pb in the ocean have focused on the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, and the impact of anthropogenic Pb inputs to the Indian Ocean and processes controlling the distribution of Pb in the Indian Ocean are poorly known. This study presents the Pb and Pb isotopic composition (206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/207Pb) of 11 deep stations from the Indian Ocean Japanese GEOTRACES cruise (KH-09-5), from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea to the Southern Ocean (62°S). The Pb isotope ratios of the Indian Ocean range 1.140–1.190 for 206Pb/207Pb and 2.417–2.468 for 208Pb/207Pb, with lower ratios appearing in the shallow waters of the northern Indian Ocean and higher ratios appearing in the deep layers of the Southern Ocean. This result agrees with a previous study on Pb concentrations (Echegoyen et al., 2014) showing that the Indian Ocean, particularly its northern part, is largely perturbed by anthropogenic Pb inputs. 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb of the Indian sector Southern Ocean are still lower than natural Pb, showing this region was also affected by anthropogenic Pb. Anomalously low or high 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb were observed in the thermocline and shallow waters of the southern Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, which are ascribed to water mass distribution (e.g., Subantarctic Mode Water) and evolving Pb isotope ratios of this region as dominant anthropogenic Pb sources change. 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb in the Bay of Bengal are higher than those in the Arabian Sea, which might be the result of the anthropogenic Pb inputs from different provenance or seawater exchanging Pb isotopes with natural particles derived from rivers and/or sediments at the basin boundaries.","","article","","170","","","Impact of anthropogenic Pb and ocean circulation on the recent distribution of Pb isotopes in the Indian Ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703715005074","0016-7037","2015","126-144","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"

Also the number of economically motivated acts of intentional food adulteration is on the rise. As unintentional outbreaks of foodborne disease may severely harm sensitive consumers and because food trade is highly interconnected, an attack on one country’s food supply can have global personal, social, economic, and political impacts. Therefore, nations and food producers must take responsibility in protecting the agrifood chain against malicious and economically motivated acts of food tampering. Reducing the likeliness of deliberate contamination of agriculture and food products requires the implementation of food defense strategies. Food defense aims to mitigate the risks and hazards of intentional contamination in food operations by introducing a selection of countermeasures to make vulnerable elements in the agrifood chain/food operation more secure. However, although food defense builds barriers around vulnerable points to prohibit intentional adulteration, it cannot prevent it. Therefore, there is a need for a sensitive surveillance system to detect acts of intentional food contamination quickly, an alert system to recognize an incident involving food, and a program that must prepare the operation in responding to assaults of intentional food contamination. Response includes all measures to quickly and efficiently identify, contain, and minimize the impact of an intentional food contamination incident (e.g., by recall of suspected products), and to allow the food producer to recover and regain normal production levels. Preparedness also includes being trained in adequate risk and crisis communication, as it is what makes a public outrage different from a collaboration when addressing a food defense incident.

Owing to an inconsistent use of the terminology, it is often difficult to determine whether studies have described storm-built or wave-built deposits. Both deposits can be identified by overall similar coarse-grained sedimentary facies, but may provide contradictory paleoenvironmental interpretations. The aim of this study is to address this issue, by analysing a set of published 14C ages recovered from wave-built sediment bodies of the Pertuis Charentais (France). Integration of 14C data highlights seven coarse-grained sedimentation pulses (CSPs) that reflect a synchronous increase in wave-induced sediment supply occurring around 2650, 2420, 1240, 970, 800, 650 and 450cal. yr B.P. CSPs can be matched with geochronological data published on other exposed sandy coasts of the western Europe. In first order, CSPs were preserved during phases of decreased storm activity and thus limited coastal erosion in the North Atlantic Ocean from 2700 to 2000 and from 1200 to 600cal. yr B.P. In second order, CSPs occurred during positive NAO and/or negative EA/WR peaks, which are known from previous studies to induce higher waves and to enhance wave-induced sediment transport in the Pertuis Charentais. Chronological boundaries of CSPs could be used as a diagnostic tool to differentiate storm deposits indicative of sudden, episodic very high-energy sedimentation from wave deposits resulting from the sustained action of above-average westerly winds blowing across the North Atlantic Ocean.","","article","","485","","","Climate control on late Holocene high-energy sedimentation along coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018217303887","0031-0182","2017","784-797","Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"

The data were used to investigate temporal trends in vegetation and to examine the relationships among radiocaesium concentrations in soils and various plant species. Radionuclide concentrations in Calluna vulgaris were compared with those in Erica cinerea, Erica tetralix and Juncus squarrosus and a consistent pattern emerged on all three study sites. No marked seasonal variations in concentrations were observed in these species. Clearly defined seasonal behaviour was, however, observed in Scirpus caespitosus. Concentrations were highest in Calluna vulgaris and Scirpus caespitosus, reaching peak activities of approximately 2000 Bq kg−1 dry weight. Concentrations in the other species were considerably less. A plant-to-plant ratio system is proposed as a new method for prediction of radionuclide concentrations in plants. Values calculated for plant-to-plant ratios are compared to traditional soil-to-plant ratio values and field data are used to test the performance of these ratios. Replication of both ratio systems gave consistent results when the experiments were repeated. The data demonstrate that the plant-to-plant ratio system can produce predictions as accurately as the soil-to-plant system. Results further suggest that the two systems are intrinsically related and that ratio values tend to be site specific but are of some value for between site predictions.","","article","","18","","","A new method for prediction of radiocaesium levels in vegetation: Evidence from Irish uplands","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0265931X9390065F","0265-931X","1993","53-70","Journal of Environmental Radioactivity"

Due to the local-scale extent of hail-affected areas and a lack of appropriate observing systems in most regions, hailstorms are not captured accurately and comprehensively, which makes statistical analysis of their frequency or climatology more difficult. Various studies have been conducted so far to describe and analyze the frequency of hailstorms or related impacts. These studies, however, refer to a wide range of spatial scales and consider different time periods, investigation methods, or hailstone diameters. This article will give a comprehensive overview and review of the present state of knowledge on hail hazard and hail frequency over recent decades up to centuries across Europe and is intended as a reference for future studies. We attempted to summarize and synthesize the various prevailing studies with the objective to identify regions that are most prone to hail hazard. Another focus is put on mechanisms that may explain spatial variability and inhomogeneities in hail frequency observed across various spatial scales.","","article","","176-177","","","Hail observations and hailstorm characteristics in Europe: A review","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809516300291","0169-8095","2016","159-184","Atmospheric Research"

Its environmental conditions depend on the hydrological processes in the catchment area, meteorological forcing, oceanographic processes in the sea, and the interactions between these. The water body of the central Baltic is permanently stratified, with an upper layer of low-salinity (6–8psu) water and a more saline (10–14psu) deepwater layer, both separated by a strong halocline. Strong environmental gradients create a variety of habitats with different biota in different subbasins. Due to its young age and reduced salinity the biological structure of the Baltic Sea is relatively restricted. Low species richness is often associated with strong dominance of a few species and high productivity. Being a semienclosed sea surrounded by densely populated and highly industrialized countries, the Baltic Sea is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressure. Currently, the major threats to the Baltic Sea are chemical contamination, eutrophication, and hypoxia. Therefore, anthropogenic pressure along with related climate change should be taken into account for assessment of the environmental status of the Baltic Sea and its future changes.","","incollection","Academic Press","","World Seas: an Environmental Evaluation (Second Edition)","978-0-12-805068-2","Chapter 4 - The Baltic Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012805068200005X","","2019","85-111",""

The pyrope/host partition coefficients are fairly uniform and agree with experimental data within a factor of 2. The almandine/matrix data show more scatter (due in part to impurities in the garnet separates) but the partition coefficients tend to increase with increasing SiO ratio of the matrix.

The spessartine-almandine is strongly enriched in heavy rare earths (~ 5000 times chondrites), Y, Sc and Co.

This region, which has been identified as a “hotspot” for climate change, is therefore expected to experience environmental impacts that are considerably greater than those in many other places around the world. These natural pressures interact with the increasing demographic and economic developments occurring heterogeneously in the coastal zone, making the Mediterranean even more sensitive. This review paper aims to provide a review of the state of current functioning and responses of Mediterranean marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems with respect to key natural and anthropogenic drivers and to consider the ecosystems’ responses to likely changes in physical, chemical and socio-economical forcings induced by global change and by growing anthropogenic pressure at the regional scale. The current knowledge on and expected changes due to single forcing (hydrodynamics, solar radiation, temperature and acidification, chemical contaminants) and combined forcing (nutrient sources and stoichiometry, extreme events) affecting the biogeochemical fluxes and ecosystem functioning are explored. Expected changes in biodiversity resulting from the combined action of the different forcings are proposed. Finally, modeling capabilities and necessity for modeling are presented. A synthesis of our current knowledge of expected changes is proposed, highlighting relevant questions for the future of the Mediterranean ecosystems that are current research priorities for the scientific community. Finally, we discuss how these priorities can be approached by national and international multi-disciplinary research, which should be implemented on several levels, including observational studies and modeling at different temporal and spatial scales.","","article","","91","","","Marine ecosystems’ responses to climatic and anthropogenic forcings in the Mediterranean","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661111000188","0079-6611","2011","97-166","Progress in Oceanography"

Diet is the most important extrinsic factor but its influence depends on the duration of feeding. Cattle produced under extensive grass-based production systems generally have carcass fat which is more yellow than their intensively-reared, concentrate-fed counterparts and this is caused by carotenoids from green forage. Although yellow carcass fat is negatively regarded in many countries, evidence suggests it may be associated with a healthier fatty acid profile and antioxidant content in beef, synonymous with grass feeding. Nonetheless, management strategies to reduce fat colour of grass-fed cattle are sought after. Current research suggests that yellow colour of this tissue is reduced if pasture-fed cattle are converted to a grain-based diet, which results in accretion of adipose tissue and dilution of carotenoids. Colour changes may depend on the initial yellow colour, the carotene and utilisable energy in the finishing diet, the duration of finishing, the amount of fat accumulated during finishing and the rate of utilisation of carotene from body fat. Differences in nutritional strategies which cause differences in fatty acid composition may be reflected by differences in fat colour and carotenoid concentration. Fat colour and carotenoids are prominent among a panoply of measurements which can aid the authentication of the dietary history and thus to some extent, the origin of beef, although this potential utility is complicated by the simultaneous rather than discrete use of forages and concentrates in real production systems.","","article","","81","","","Colour of bovine subcutaneous adipose tissue: A review of contributory factors, associations with carcass and meat quality and its potential utility in authentication of dietary history","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174008002155","0309-1740","2009","28-45","Meat Science"

The results are compared with inferences derived using non-Bayesian weighted averaging partial least-squares regression. The reconstruction exhibits both long-term trends as well as a series of shorter-term oscillations. Abrupt climatic excursions were particularly characteristic for the early Holocene period, with cooling episodes around 9200, 8600 and 8200calyr BP. The interval from ca 8000 to 5800calyr BP appeared to be warm and stable, but was followed by a pronounced climatic cooling around 5800calyr BP leading to a relatively long-lasting mid-Holocene temperature minimum between ca 5800 and 4000calyr BP. The reconstruction during the latter part of the Holocene is relatively featureless, which may partly be due to gradual shallowing of the lake by sedimentation that may have affected chironomid compositions, thereby masking the climate signal. The major climatic patterns in our reconstruction agree well with inferences from Greenland ice and marine sediments and are also in line with the previous reconstructions based on diatoms and pollen from the same core, although the finer-scale variations reflected by the three proxies do not always match. The overall results provide evidence for climatic complexity during the Holocene epoch and demonstrate that Bayesian modelling is highly suitable for reconstruction purposes.","","article","","21","","","Holocene temperature changes in northern Fennoscandia reconstructed from chironomids using Bayesian modelling","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379102000033","0277-3791","2002","1841-1860","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Samples for optical and AMS 14C dating were taken from the same Mackereth cores, allowing a direct comparison of the two techniques from two laminated sedimentary sequences. Additional AMS 14C samples were taken from water in Lake Keilambete and from groundwater discharging into Lake Keilambete from the crater wall, with equivalent reservoir ages of 150 ± 30 and 1940 ± 30 years respectively. AMS 14C dating of modern ostracod carbonate in Lake Keilambete demonstrates a reservoir age of 670 ± 175 years. Optical dating of ‘single-grain/very small aliquots’ of sand-sized-quartz indicate the presence of a radiocarbon reservoir in Lake Keilambete that is consistent with that measured on modern ostracods, and also demonstrate that there is no 14C reservoir in Lake Gnotuk during the Holocene. The chronology presented here supports the premise that previously published bulk conventional 14C dates from Lake Keilambete were affected by old carbon, meaning that past chronologies require revision. Limitations on the use of optical dating of single-grain/very small aliquots include the relative paucity of sand-sized quartz, which decreases the precision of the sample equivalent dose (De), and is further confounded by low environmental dose rates and resultant large uncertainties on the final age assessment. Nevertheless, evidence for partial bleaching confirms that single-grain quartz dating is the most appropriate luminescence technique, and may prove a useful alternative in situations where 14C dating is unsuitable or an alternative chronometer is required.","","article","","9","","","Comparative optical and radiocarbon dating of laminated Holocene sediments in two maar lakes: Lake Keilambete and Lake Gnotuk, south-western Victoria, Australia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871101412000106","1871-1014","2012","3-15","Quaternary Geochronology"

We analysed the spatial–temporal variability of the aquatic environment and NEP through in-situ monitoring and field sampling from December 2018 to January 2020 at three outlets (Humen, Jiaomen, and Hongqimen) with different hydrological conditions in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China, and explored the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on NEP. The 155 groups of effective metabolism values were estimated using Odum's open-water method. The daily ecosystem respiration (ER) was higher than the gross primary production (GPP); therefore, water bodies were dominated by net heterotrophy at the three outlets. The daily NEP (–4.34 ± 1.40 mg O2 L–1d–1), O2 concentration (5.2 ± 1.02 mg L–1), and pH (7.53±0.24) were lowest at Humen, which also had the largest discharge and tide volume, deepest water depth, and widest channel. Seasonally, the NEP in the summer (–3.30 ± 1.39 mg O2 L–1d–1) and autumn (–3.19 ± 1.60 mg O2 L–1d–1) was lower than those in the spring (–1.56 ± 1.92 mg O2 L–1d–1) and winter (–2.17 ± 1.50 mg O2 L–1d–1). The inhibitory effect of increased discharge on the metabolic rate exceeded the stimulation provided by seasonal factors, such as increased temperature and solar radiation. The scour and dilution effect caused by discharge increase reduced chlorophyll a concentration; meanwhile, the increase in turbidity resulted in a decrease in the photosynthetic rate and GPP. ER was stimulated by heterotrophic microorganisms and high total suspended solids, resulting in a decrease in O2 and endogenous organics, thus causing the low NEP, hypoxia, and acidification phenomenon. Our results suggest that lengthening the discharge pulse period in summer and autumn will further decrease NEP and increase the area of hypoxia and acidification at the three outlets in the PRE.","","article","","214","","","High discharge intensified low net ecosystem productivity, hypoxia, and acidification at three outlets of the Pearl River Estuary, China","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135422001348","0043-1354","2022","118171","Water Research"

Meanwhile, DP capability comes down to the ability of the thrust generated by thrusters to counteract environmental forces. Therefore, it is significant to investigate which thrusters are important to the position-keeping ability of vessels. However, complex environmental factors make the investigation of thrusters' importance more complicated. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to identify the influence of each thruster on vessel's station-keeping capability in different sea states. The station-keeping capability is quantified by a defined synthesized positioning ability criterion comprised by vessel position, heading angle, and consumed power. Through the comparison of different machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM) is used for building a surrogate model between DP capability and thrusters. In order to determine the most sensitive thruster in the whole process of vessel operation, an improved sensitivity analysis (SA) called ‘PAWN’ is employed along with statistical analysis to evaluate the significance of thrusters from different perspectives. Seventeen cases are investigated with respect to different thruster failures in various sea states. The results show the proposed method is able to identify the significance of each thruster in different scenarios.","","article","","223","","","A sensitivity quantification approach to significance analysis of thrusters in dynamic positioning operations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801821000949","0029-8018","2021","108659","Ocean Engineering"

The available researches on rainfall occurrence in India represent inconsistency in several fundamental considerations (spatial scale of analysis, the definition of rainfall classes, methods, dataset, study period, etc.) and lack of studies for non-monsoon seasons over large parts of the subcontinent. Here we attempt to deal with these inconsistencies by examining space–time patterns in seasonal count of rainfall events and their count in different rainfall classes during 1951–2015 for all meteorological seasons of India using high resolution (0.25°) gridded daily rainfall dataset. The results show a widespread decline in monsoon rainy days over major crop-growing regions including north-central, central, and northeast India. A reduction in rainy days is also observed over parts of central India in premonsoon; over north-central and northeast India in postmonsoon; and over peninsular India in winter. These trends are mainly observed in events with rainfall <95th percentile (light to heavy rainfall events) in all the seasons. Occurrence of extreme events (above 95th and 99th percentile) exhibits contrasting trends over different zones with mainly an increase over central and south-central India and decline over central-north India. However, trends in extremes are highly dispersed in space and are conclusive only over a few regions. The observed trends substantially deviate from the patterns reported in past studies for different regions. Rainfall occurrence in different meteorological zones also represents strong interannual and decadal variability, however, the observed trends have emerged beyond the inherent natural variability. The present findings provide an essential foundation for several future explorations with improved understanding of change in rainfall frequency and its possible impacts. It would also assist in developing a comprehensive framework for year-wide management of water resources and agriculture, considering all crop seasons.","","article","","603","","","Characterizing rainfall occurrence in India: Natural variability and recent trends","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421010295","0022-1694","2021","126979","Journal of Hydrology"

Despite their ecological and economical importance, there is still a lack of reliable spatial information on their abundance and distribution. In recent years, various hydroacoustic mapping techniques for sublittoral environments evolved. However, in turbid coastal waters, such as off the island of Helgoland (Germany, North Sea), the kelp vegetation is present in shallow water depths normally excluded from hydroacoustic surveys. In this study, single beam survey data consisting of the two seafloor parameters roughness and hardness were obtained with RoxAnn from water depth between 2 and 18 m. Our primary aim was to reliably detect the kelp forest habitat with different densities and distinguish it from other vegetated zones. Five habitat classes were identified using underwater-video and were applied for classification of acoustic signatures. Subsequently, spatial prediction maps were produced via two classification approaches: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and manual classification routine (MC). LDA was able to distinguish dense kelp forest from other habitats (i.e. mixed seaweed vegetation, sand, and barren bedrock), but no variances in kelp density. In contrast, MC also provided information on medium dense kelp distribution which is characterized by intermediate roughness and hardness values evoked by reduced kelp abundances. The prediction maps reach accordance levels of 62% (LDA) and 68% (MC). The presence of vegetation (kelp and mixed seaweed vegetation) was determined with higher prediction abilities of 75% (LDA) and 76% (MC). Since the different habitat classes reveal acoustic signatures that strongly overlap, the manual classification method was more appropriate for separating different kelp forest densities and low-lying vegetation. It became evident that the occurrence of kelp in this area is not simply linked to water depth. Moreover, this study shows that the two seafloor parameters collected with RoxAnn are suitable indicators for the discrimination of different densely vegetated seafloor habitats in shallow environments.","","article","","143","","","Predicting spatial kelp abundance in shallow coastal waters using the acoustic ground discrimination system RoxAnn","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277141400064X","0272-7714","2014","1-11","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science"

Using this innovative technique, the remains of Yue kiln and anomalous objects buried beneath the lake or suspended in the water can now be fully studied. Although GPR has been widely used for imaging archaeological sites, skepticism remains over its use in underwater archaeology. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that it is possible to use GPR to detect underwater remains, which has been further confirmed by the use of electrical parameter measurement (EPM) in Shanglinhu Lake. An experiment was performed by our team using antennas of different frequencies in a particular area of the lake. The results showed that the penetrability of the 100 MHz antenna was enough to examine the targets, while the 400 MHz antenna performed well in shallow water (depth <4 m) due to higher resolution. Hence, for our underwater investigation, we used both antennas for maximum coverage. We used a radargram as a topographic map which shows cross sections of the lake.

Improved understanding of the latter influences is important for geothermal climate applications and to generate a comprehensive knowledge-framework of subsurface warming, including inherent spatial variability. Here I examine sixteen wells in a relatively small area in The Netherlands, each with two available temperature logs recorded some three decades apart. Temperature differences of the log pairs reveal marked differences in subsurface warming amongst the wells for this time period. Forward modelling of the observed temperature changes, using surface air temperature (SAT) forcing, shows that a considerable part of this inter-site variability may be caused by inter-site differences in thermal properties and groundwater flow conditions. However, for some of the wells these factors are insufficient, implying contributions from non-SAT-driven changes in ground surface temperature (GST). In one case an anomalous decrease in GST can be linked to back-growth of the canopy after forest cutting. For another well site, GST warming has been less than SAT warming in the absence of apparent changes in surface conditions, indicating local, subtle influences on the surface energy balance independent of SAT. The results demonstrate that repeated borehole temperature logging resolves key uncertainties and ambiguities pertaining to interpretation of individual temperature logs. The study further highlights the importance of establishing high-quality borehole temperature databases, also for these relatively complex settings with dynamic and variable surface conditions.","","article","","270","","","Spatial variability in subsurface warming over the last three decades; insight from repeated borehole temperature measurements in The Netherlands","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08001751","0012-821X","2008","86-94","Earth and Planetary Science Letters"

The model allows simulation of the development of wide bimodal droplet size spectra due to in-cloud nucleation of new droplets on aerosol particles that remain nonactivated at the cloud base and ascend within cloud updrafts along with cloud droplets. New droplets are nucleated at a distance of a few hundred meters above the cloud base, where supersaturation in ascending cloud parcels exceeds the supersaturation maximum near the cloud base. In numerical experiments, the thermodynamic conditions are studied under which the bimodal droplet size distributions can form in convective clouds. It is shown that these conditions really take place in the atmosphere. The effect of thermodynamic conditions on the shape of droplet spectra is illustrated in numerical experiments with different values of relative humidity in the sub-cloud layer and different values of the temperature gradient in the cloud layer. The mechanism of in-cloud nucleation of new droplets helps to explain observations such as the high spatial variability in cloud spectra and the increase in the fraction of samples with bimodal spectra with an increase in cloud layer instability observed by Warner [J.

The technical aspects of sensors are summarized and the benefits and limitations of each sensor are given. The use of visible techniques is ubiquitous; however, it gives only the same results as visible monitoring. Oil has no particular spectral features that would allow for identification among the many possible background interferences. Identification of specific oil types is not possible. Cameras are useful to provide documentation. Infrared (IR) offers some potential as an oil spill sensor. In daytime oil absorbs light and remits a portion of this as thermal energy at temperatures 3–4K above ambient. IR cameras are economical; however, they suffer from problems such as the inability to discriminate oil from interferences on beaches, among weeds, debris or sediment, and under certain lighting conditions. Furthermore, water-in-oil emulsions may not be detected in the infrared, depending on light and sea conditions. The laser fluorosensor is a useful instrument because of its unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, weeds, ice, and snow. It is the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. The laser fluorosensor also allows for positive identification and discrimination between oil types. Radar detects oil on water because oil dampens water-surface capillary waves under low to moderate wave/wind conditions. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches, day/night and foul weather remote sensing. False targets can be as high as 95%. Satellite-borne radar sensors are now extensively used for mapping large spills or assisting in ship and platform discharge monitoring.

Its role in human activities dates back to the earliest times of European history, which partly explains the impacts it has received. Recent past periods of high eutrophication and overfishing of top predators are now a part of history, but they triggered a change in the Black Sea system to a new state that damaged its resilience. Previously, the whole sea was close to collapse, but today pressures have changed and now include invasive species, more limited fresh water input, global changes in atmospheric dynamics, and others that lead to unpredictable changes, which, along with human economic activities, make the future of the Black Sea the subject of intense scientific interest.","","incollection","Academic Press","","World Seas: an Environmental Evaluation (Second Edition)","978-0-12-805068-2","Chapter 8 - Black Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128050682000115","","2019","209-226",""

Females with imposex were present at all sampling sites with highest levels inside main harbors. Imposex parameters across sampling stations varied between 6.3% and 100% for %I, 0.2–4.4 for VDSI, 0.1–7.8mm for FPL, 0.3–88.9% for RPLI and 0.0–1.1 for AOS. TBT levels varied between 3.5 and 380ngSng−1 dw, representing an average proportion of 50.4% of total butyltins (∑BTs=MBT+DBT+TBT). Sterile females were detected at two locations. Highly significant correlations between imposex and TBT levels were found. The efficacy of the EU legislation banning the use of TBT-based antifouling paints since 2003 (EC Regulation 782/2003) was evaluated by comparing the levels of imposex observed in 2008 with those reported for 2003. OTs tissue concentrations were also determined in preserved samples collected in 2003. There was a decrease in imposex and TBT tissue contamination between 2003 and 2008 indicating that a decline in TBT pollution has occurred in the Portuguese coast since the implementation of the legislation. Considering that the EC Regulation 782/2003 is an anticipation of the IMO AFS Convention, a global scale decrease in TBT pollution can be expected in the near future. Despite the rapid amelioration in the Portuguese coast, TBT pollution is still a problem as the Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) proposed by OSPAR Commission was not achieved in 91% of the surveyed sites.","","article","","77","","","Imposex and organotin prevalence in a European post-legislative scenario: Temporal trends from 2003 to 2008","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653509007577","0045-6535","2009","566-573","Chemosphere"

As this phenomenon is responsible for the major interannual climatic variability and has a great potential to document links between the atmospheric and oceanic circulations, it is important to understand its mechanism, its boundary conditions and the causes of the variations of its intensity. Many answers to such questions can be sought in the historical and geological record of El Niño occurrences. Former impacts of the El Niño phenomenon along the western coast of South America are documented by remnants of catastrophic rainfalls and associated river floods, records of lake salinity variations, beach ridge sequences and numerous evidences of alterations in the biotic and physical coastal environment. For the last millennium or so, relatively precise (although discontinuous) archaeological and historical data are available. Continuous, high-resolution, proxy records are provided by glaciological data (last 1500 yr) from the Quelccaya ice cap of southern Peru and are potentially available from coral cores from the Galapagos Islands. No marine varves that would permit a detailed and sequential study of El Niño-related oceanographic anomalies during the late Quaternary have yet been obtained off western South America. The reconstruction of the sequence of the main ENSO events during the last millennia is thus hampered by the fact that there are too few continuous records and that these have not necessarily registered every El Niño occurrence and/or the relative intensity of each event. The discontinuous records of major El Niño events are more numerous, but often lack the required chronological accuracy. Obviously, both series of data need to be cross-checked and compared with information (e.g. dendroclimatology and marine varves) from other regions of the globe where climate teleconnections with the ENSO phenomenon can be assessed.","","article","","7","","","Former El Niño events: records from western South America","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092181819390049T","0921-8181","1993","181-202","Global and Planetary Change"

This study aimed at investigating a dinoflagellate bloom linked to acute dermatitis cases in two recreational beaches in Cienfuegos Bay, Cuba. We used epidemiological and clinical data from 60 dermatitis cases consisting of individuals in close contact with the bloom. Seawater physical-chemical properties were described, and the microorganism causing the bloom was identified by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. Morphological identification was confirmed genetically by sequencing the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2, and the 5.8S rDNA region. Toxic compounds were identified from a bloom extract using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and their concentrations were estimated based on low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sixty people who had prolonged contact with the dinoflagellate bloom suffered acute dermal irritation. Most patients (79.2%) were children and had to be treated with antibiotics; some required >5-day hospitalization. Combined morphological and genetic characters indicated V. rugosum as the causative agent of the bloom. rDNA sequences of the V. rugosum genotype found in the bloom aligned with others from Asia, including material found in the ballast tank of a ship in Florida. The predominant toxins in the bloom were portimine, PnTX-F and PnTX-E, similar to strains originating from the Pacific Ocean. This bloom was associated with unusual weather conditions such as frequent and prolonged droughts. Our findings indicate a close link between the V. rugosum bloom and a dermatitis outbreak among swimmers in Cienfuegos Bay.

Outbreaks of the western spruce budworm often occur synchronously over broad regions and lead to widespread loss of leaf area and decrease in growth rates in affected stands. In spite of the ecological and economic significance of this defoliator, the mechanisms controlling this species’ population dynamics are still not fully understood. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct three centuries of western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana and compared the outbreak reconstructions with regional drought history. The reconstructions reveal repeated western spruce budworm outbreaks that sometimes persisted more than a decade and were significantly synchronous among sites. Synchrony was higher in the second half of the record, possibly due to changes in forest composition and structure brought about by land use practices. Across stands and regions, there was a moderately strong relationship between initiation of synchronous outbreaks and periods of transitional climate conditions in which moisture availability was below average prior to outbreak initiation, but above average in the first few years of an outbreak. There was a weak relationship between cessation of outbreaks and one or more years of high moisture availability. Outbreaks tended to occur near the end of droughts. The association between climatic variability and outbreak dynamics observed across this transect indicates that climate is an important driver of western spruce budworm outbreaks. Other factors that we did not test, but that may influence outbreak dynamics include stand structure, forest composition, predation, and phenological synchrony between larvae and host trees. Future changes in western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics will be determined by a combination of changing climate, interactions with other disturbance agents, and changing forest composition and structure. Our results suggest that western spruce budworm outbreaks will likely intensify if drought frequency increases in the future.","","article","","324","","","Drought-triggered western spruce budworm outbreaks in the interior Pacific Northwest: A multi-century dendrochronological record","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714001960","0378-1127","2014","16-27","Forest Ecology and Management"

Many services and applications, such as navigation assistance, surveillance of patients and social networking, have been developed based on users’ position. Although the GPS plays an important role in positioning systems, its signal strength is extremely weak inside buildings. Thus, other sensing devices are necessary to improve the accuracy of indoor localisation. In the past decade, researchers have developed a series of indoor positioning technologies based on the received signal strength (RSS) of WiFi, ZigBee or Bluetooth devices under the infrastructure of wireless sensor network for location estimation. We can compute the distance of the devices by measuring their RSS, but the correctness of the result is unsatisfactory because the radio signal interference is a considerable issue and the indoor radio propagation is too complicated to model. Using the location fingerprint to estimate a target position is a feasible strategy because the location fingerprint records the characteristics of the signals and the signal strength is related to the space relation. This type of algorithm estimates the location of a target by matching online measurements with the closest a-priori location fingerprints. The matching or classification algorithm is a key issue in the correctness of location fingerprinting. In this paper, we propose an effective location fingerprinting algorithm based on the general and weighted k-nearest neighbour algorithms to estimate the position of the target node. The grid points are trained with an interval of 2 m, and the estimated position error is about 1.8 m. Thus, the proposed method is low computation consumption, and with an acceptable accuracy.","","article","","62","","","Indoor positioning system based on BLE location fingerprinting with classification approach","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X18302841","0307-904X","2018","654-663","Applied Mathematical Modelling"

Temperate mountain glacier extent is sensitive to summer air temperature, thus geological records of past glacier length changes are a useful proxy for this climatic variable. Here we present a new cosmogenic 10Be chronology of glacier length changes at Dart Glacier in the Southern Alps, New Zealand. Prominent moraines deposited 321 ± 44 yr ago (n = 11) and 7.8 ± 0.3 ka (n = 5) show glaciers during the Little Ice Age were less extensive than during the early Holocene. This pattern of net Holocene glacier retreat is consistent with emerging data from other catchments in New Zealand and across the southern mid-latitudes. Using the physical framework of a transient global climate model simulation, we suggest that cool summers in the early Holocene were promoted by the local summer insolation minimum, together with low atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, causing an early Holocene austral glacial maximum. An insolation-driven reduction in seasonality at southern mid-latitudes may reconcile differences between early Holocene temperature reconstructions where climate proxies have different seasonal sensitivities. We suggest that rising greenhouse gas concentrations after 7 ka caused regional-scale glacier retreat and appear to be the dominant driver of multi-millennial summer temperature trends in the southern mid-latitudes during the present interglacial.","","article","","266","","","Local summer insolation and greenhouse gas forcing drove warming and glacier retreat in New Zealand during the Holocene","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379121002754","0277-3791","2021","107068","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Whenever the process to be mined is complex and highly-flexible, however, equipping all the traces with just one model might lead to mixing different usage scenarios, thereby resulting in a spaghetti-like process description. This is, in fact, often circumvented by preliminarily applying clustering methods on the process log in order to identify all its hidden variants. In this paper, two relevant problems that arise in the context of applying such methods are addressed, which have received little attention so far: (i) making the clustering aware of outlier traces, and (ii) finding predictive models for clustering results. The first issue impacts on the effectiveness of clustering algorithms, which can indeed be led to confuse real process variants with exceptional behavior or malfunctions. The second issue instead concerns the opportunity of predicting the behavioral class of future process instances, by taking advantage of context-dependent “non-structural” data (e.g., activity executors, parameter values). The paper formalizes and analyzes these two issues and illustrates various mining algorithms to face them. All the algorithms have been implemented and integrated into a system prototype, which has been thoroughly validated over two real-life application scenarios.","","article","","70","","","Mining usage scenarios in business processes: Outlier-aware discovery and run-time prediction","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X11000930","0169-023X","2011","1005-1029","Data & Knowledge Engineering"

Using lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) technology and operating from a Bell 212 helicopter, SHOALS remotely collects accurate, high-resolution bathymetry at a rate of 8 km2/h. A nominal depth-and-position measurement spacing of 4 m yields high-density bottom coverage of coastal projects, producing soundings from the above-water beach, or coastal structure, to depths of 40 m. Since becoming fully operational, SHOALS surveyed over 2000 km2 along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, and Caribbean Sea. Survey projects varied from tidal inlets and navigation channels to beach nourishment and monitoring. These projects quantify current coastal structure condition, navigation channel alignments, and morphologic changes over time. In addition to monitoring coastal projects, sediment transport can be estimated with accurate, high-resolution bathymetry. Bathymetry can be translated into sediment transport through a combination of the sediment continuity equation, a surf zone energetics-based longshore transport formula, and bathymetric data. This paper presents the SHOALS system describing both lidar technology and the survey system. Several SHOALS data sets are presented to show today's benefits of high-resolution lidar bathymetry to the coastal engineering community. Finally, ongoing research using these unique data sets is presented to show the future benefits of lidar bathymetry to the coastal field.","","article","","35","","","Coastal engineering applications of high-resolution lidar bathymetry","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378383998000222","0378-3839","1998","47-71","Coastal Engineering"

This work employed a high-quality daily temperature dataset of 128 station records spanning the period from 1959 to 2006. The uppermost (99th) percentile of daily maximum temperature distribution was used to define very warm days (hereafter VWD), while the lowermost (1st) percentile of daily minimum temperature distribution was adopted to identify very cold nights (hereafter VCN). The climatological conditions related to the initialization and persistence of these rare events were also examined. Based on daily Sea Level Pressure (SLP) and 200hPa and 500hPa geopotential height fields from the NCEP/NCAR re-analyses, major large-scale circulation patterns corresponding to these events over large domain of the North Atlantic and European regions were used in order to explore their interrelations with anomalous temperature in the study domain. Our results demonstrate that the occurrence of VCN was mainly associated to the dominance of cyclonic (anticyclonic) conditions over southern Europe and the Mediterranean (Scandinavia). This situation corresponded to an increase in the meridional circulation over much area of Western Europe, with strong advection of colder air from northern continental Europe and the north Atlantic to the study domain. For VWD, the most likely factors contributing to the frequency of these events were the north-eastward displacement of the Atlantic subtropical high and the increase in the European blockings. Based on data derived from a suite of regional climate models (RCMs) with the best validation results, future projections of the frequency and intensity of VWD and VCN events were also assessed under the A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario. Our results demonstrate that future VWD extremes could become more frequent and severe during the latter decades of the 21st century, while a number of simulations projected a general tendency for fewer VCN extremes. Over the study domain climate models predict even faster warming rates for the continental areas relative to coastal portions, which clearly comes in contrast with the observed climatology.","","article","","101","","","Anomalously severe cold nights and warm days in northeastern Spain: their spatial variability, driving forces and future projections","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092181811200224X","0921-8181","2013","12-32","Global and Planetary Change"

The polymers polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) dominated which is in line with other studies analyzing surface waters from rivers in Western Europe as well as in China. Statistical analyses show that the plastic concentration close to the mouth of the Danube River was significantly higher than at four nearshore regions along the Romanian and Bulgarian coastline. This could be explained by plastic inputs from the Danube River into the western part of the Black Sea.","","article","","268","","","Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of plastic particles in surface waters of the Western Black Sea","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120364137","0269-7491","2021","115724","Environmental Pollution"

Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10 m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available. First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored. Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales. Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2's greatest strengths.","","article","","216","","","Coral reef applications of Sentinel-2: Coverage, characteristics, bathymetry and benthic mapping with comparison to Landsat 8","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442571830347X","0034-4257","2018","598-614","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Siderite concretions occur throughout the split, commonly as sheet-like, inter-connected lepidodendrid logs, or less frequently as spherical masses; they are typically vuggy. A sample of 14 stratigraphically oriented concretions in the split shows that primary siderite varies from 45% to 80% (wt.%) due to selective replacement by 5% to 40% ferroan dolomite or ankerite in plant tissues. These two minerals show large Mg/Fe and Mg/Ca variability and are Fezoned. Clay content ranges from trace to 20%, and quartz from 5% to 10%. Partial cell-wall destruction by erosion and changeable oxic/anoxic conditions, prior to siderite permineralization, resulted in preservation mainly of the more resistant plant tissues. On average, carbon from siderite is isotopically heavier (+4.8±1.9 0/00) than that from `dolomite' (−7.2±1.1 0/00). The distribution of and the positive correlation between δ13C and δ18O probably reflects the two fractionation processes associated with methanogenesis and `dolomitization', respectively, in the genetic history of the siderite concretions in the split. Siderite concretions formed diagenetically early from bicarbonate under reducing conditions in a slightly alkaline freshwater environment that precluded calcite deposition.","","article","","41","","","Anatomically preserved plants in siderite concretions in the shale split of the Foord Seam: mineralogy, geochemistry, genesis (Upper Carboniferous, Canada)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516299000245","0166-5162","1999","371-393","International Journal of Coal Geology"

The mechanistic exploration of this nonlinearity and its quantification in the energy exchange perspective has been demonstrated in this chapter. Considering El Niño as a low frequency oscillation having a time period of 12–18 months, the mechanism of El Niño—monsoon nonlinear relation is explored by quantifying this nonlinearity in terms of interscale transfer of kinetic energy through the process of nonlinear triad interactions in the frequency domain. The study illustrates that the variability of ISM rainfall is strongly dictated by the contrasting nonlinear interactions of El Niño with high and low frequency dominant monsoon modes and are examined for two opposite relationships between El Niño and ISM.

The data set covers January–December 2013 at three stations; namely, Cape-Verde Island (Lat: 16°N, Lon: 24°W, Mag. Lat: 11°N), Dakar (Lat: 14.75°N, Lon: 17.45°W, Mag. Lat: 5.88°N) [Senegal] and Addis Ababa (Lat: 9.03°N, Lon: 38.77°W, Mag. Lat: 0.18°N) [Ethiopia]. Firstly, we investigated the seasonal variations of scintillations over the study sites. In doing this, we suppressed multipath effects on the data by imposing a 30° elevation masking on the data. Seasonally, scintillations recorded highest occurrences during equinoxes, and the least during June solstice. Secondly, we investigated scintillation occurrences at the three sites on a satellite-by-satellite basis at varying elevation and azimuthal angles. Generally, scintillations (at both low- and high-elevation angles) recorded the highest occurrences at Cape-Verde, followed by Dakar, and the least at Addis Ababa. Scintillation activities were generally localized within the northern skies of the study locations. EGNOS satellites signals scintillated at Dakar and Addis Ababa during the time intervals when GPS satellites signals experienced scintillations. Data showed that Cape-Verde is off the EGNOS geostationary satellite footprint. These results have the potentials of supporting the development of scintillation models for equatorial Africa. Furthermore, with a view to providing robust services for the African user community, the current research effort is also expected to provide value addition to GPS and EGNOS service providers and system designers.","","article","","63","","","Characterization of GPS and EGNOS amplitude scintillations over the African equatorial/low-latitude region","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117719300419","0273-1177","2019","3062-3075","Advances in Space Research"

Computed tomography (CT) is believed to be an effective tool for diagnosing COVID-19, however, the CT scan contains hundreds of slices that are complex to be analyzed and could cause delays in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) especially deep learning (DL), could facilitate and speed up COVID-19 diagnosis from such scans. Several studies employed DL approaches based on 2D CT images from a single view, nevertheless, 3D multiview CT slices demonstrated an excellent ability to enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority of DL-based studies utilized the spatial information of the original CT images to train their models, though, using spectral–temporal information could improve the detection of COVID-19. This article proposes a DL-based pipeline called CoviWavNet for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. CoviWavNet uses a 3D multiview dataset called OMNIAHCOV. Initially, it analyzes the CT slices using multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and then uses the heatmaps of the approximation levels to train three ResNet CNN models. These ResNets use the spectral–temporal information of such images to perform classification. Subsequently, it investigates whether the combination of spatial information with spectral–temporal information could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. For this purpose, it extracts deep spectral–temporal features from such ResNets using transfer learning and integrates them with deep spatial features extracted from the same ResNets trained with the original CT slices. Then, it utilizes a feature selection step to reduce the dimension of such integrated features and use them as inputs to three support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further validate the performance of CoviWavNet, a publicly available benchmark dataset called SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan is employed. The results of CoviWavNet have demonstrated that using the spectral–temporal information of the DWT heatmap images to train the ResNets is superior to utilizing the spatial information of the original CT images. Furthermore, integrating deep spectral–temporal features with deep spatial features has enhanced the classification accuracy of the three SVM classifiers reaching a final accuracy of 99.33% and 99.7% for the OMNIAHCOV and SARS-COV-2-CT-Scan datasets respectively. These accuracies verify the outstanding performance of CoviWavNet compared to other related studies. Thus, CoviWavNet can help radiologists in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnosis.","","article","","128","","","A wavelet-based deep learning pipeline for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis via CT slices","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494622005385","1568-4946","2022","109401","Applied Soft Computing"

Samples of raw and stir-fried pools of these specimens were analysed for radioisotopes 137Cs (caesium) and 40K (potassium), and for total K concentrations. On a whole (wet) weight (ww) basis, 137Cs activity ranged from < 0.10 to 0.75 Bq kg−1 for raw, and from 0.5 to 4.4 Bq kg-1 in stir-fried mushrooms. Radiopotassium (40K) activity ranged from 57 to 96 Bq kg−1 ww for raw, and 170 to 370 Bq kg−1 ww for stir-fried mushrooms, while the corresponding concentration ranges for total K were 2100–3400 mg kg−1 ww (mean: 2800 ± 3900 mg kg−1 ww), and 6000–13000 mg kg−1 ww-(mean: 8700 ± 2100 mg kg−1 ww), respectively. This data indicates that mushrooms from this region show negligible 137Cs contamination with evidently higher activity levels of 40K. The deep oil stir-frying process results in enrichment in the resulting meals for all three determinants. 100 g meal portions showed 137Cs activity in the range < 0.08 to 0.44 Bq 100 g−1 ww (mean 0.15 ± 0.12 Bq 100 g−1 ww), and 40K activity from 16 to 37 Bq 100 g−1 ww (mean 24 ± 6 Bq 100 g−1 ww). The consequent exposure from 40K contained in a single 100 g serving and weekly (100 g x7) servings was equivalent to radiation doses in the range of 0.099 to 0.23 μSv and 0.68–1.6 μSv per capita (means 0.15 ± 0.04 and 1.1 ± 0.3 μSv). This is equivalent to doses in the range of 0.0017 to 0.0038 μSv kg-1 bm day-1 and 0.011 to 0.027 μSv kg-1 bm week-1 respectively (mean values of 0.0025 ± 0.006 μSv kg-1 bm day-1and 0.018 ± 0.004 μSv kg-1 bm week-1). Analogically to the annual 137Cs radiation exposure resulting from high rates of annual consumption (20–24 kg per capita), the estimated annual dose of radiation from 40K would range from 0.34 up to 0.92 μSv kg-1 bm (mean 0.60 μSv kg-1 bm). Thus in practice, high annual consumption rates of wild, stir-fried mushrooms as seen in Yunnan, would result in negligible internal doses from decay of artificial 137Cs, relative to that from natural 40K. The 100 g servings also contained between 590–1300 mg K making this local food one of the top dietary sources of nutritionally important potassium for local consumers.","","article","","91","","","137Caesium, 40Potassium and potassium in raw and deep-oil stir-fried mushroom meals from Yunnan in China","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157519315194","0889-1575","2020","103538","Journal of Food Composition and Analysis"

In this study we measured blubber concentration profiles of eight reproductive and adrenal steroid hormones (17α-hydroxy-progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone, cortisol, 11-deoxy-corticosterone, oestrone, and oestradiol) together with body condition, as determined by the inverse Adipocyte Index, of 101 male humpback whales. Whales were sampled randomly at two time points, while migrating to and from their northeast Australian breeding grounds, allowing for intra- and inter-seasonal profile analysis. Testosterone, progesterone and cortisol together with androstenedione 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and oestrone concentrations (the latter quantified for the first time in live biopsied male humpback whales) decreased between the northward and southward migrations. Decreasing testosterone levels during the height of humpback whale conceptions suggests asynchronicity between blubber testosterone levels and the expected peak of male fertility. Statistically significant relationships between levels of certain steroid analytes were observed and appeared to change between the early and late breeding seasons. During the northward migration, testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, oestrone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels were positively correlated. Cortisol concentrations correlated positively with those of testosterone during the northward migration, but negatively during the southward migration. Androstenedione and testosterone were positively correlated with adiposity during the late breeding season. These hormone-hormone and hormone-adiposity correlations may be reflective of the activation of certain steroid hormone synthesis pathways, or alternatively, of concomitant physiological stimuli. As steroid hormones work in concert, information on multiple steroid hormones is needed to interpret endocrinological status and understand the relationships between these compounds and ancillary health markers. This study provides steroid hormone profiles of wild male humpback whales, as well as the first insight into seasonal male endocrinology as a function of adiposity.","","article","","313","","","Steroid hormone profiles and body conditions of migrating male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae)","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648021001817","0016-6480","2021","113888","General and Comparative Endocrinology"

Mercury (Hg) and other trace elements (TEs) also present natural sources, whereas the biologically mediated input is typically ignored. However, bioaccumulation and biomagnification combined with the fact that seabirds gather in large numbers into large colonies and excrete on land might represent an important local TEs input. A previous work suggested these colonies as sources of not only nutrients, but also organic contaminants. To evaluate a similar hypothesis for TEs, samples of lichen (n = 55), mosses (n = 58) and soil (n = 37) were collected in 13 locations within the South Shetlands Archipelago during the austral summers of 2013–14 and 2014–15. They were divided in: 'colony' (within the colony itself for soil and bordering it for vegetation) and 'control' (at least 50 m away from colony interference), analysed for TEs (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn) and stable isotopes (C and N). In most cases, soil seems the best matrix to assess colonies as TEs sources, as it presented more differences between control/colony sites than vegetation. Colonies are clearly local sources of organic matter, Cd, Hg and likely of As, Se and Zn. Conversely, Co, Cr, Ni and Pb come presumably from other sources, natural or anthropogenic. In general, isotopes were more useful for interpreting vegetation data due to fractionation of absorbed animal-derived organic matter. Other local Hg sources could be inferred from high levels in control sites, location and wind patterns.","","article","","204","","","Seabird colonies as relevant sources of pollutants in Antarctic ecosystems: Part 1 - Trace elements","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653518302509","0045-6535","2018","535-547","Chemosphere"

However, the overall accuracy and uncertainty of VIIRS DB and EDR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products are still unclear in China, in particular, due to the sparse distribution of ground observation stations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate and compare VIIRS EDR and DB AOD retrievals against ground measurements collected from both Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Chinese Sun-sky radiometer Observation Network (SONET) in China from 2013 to 2018. Results suggest that both EDR and DB products have a significant refinement after quality assurance (QA) controlling. DB (QA = Best) performs best with high correction (R = 0.92), and up to 80.32% of AOD matches falling within the expected error (EE), while approximately 46% of EDR (QA = Best) AOD retrievals are overestimated. However, EDR has a higher retrieval frequency than DB over most regions of China, except for the arid and semi-arid areas such as the Northwest. Generally, despite some exceptions, both EDR and DB products perform relatively poorly in summer for all statistics. Furthermore, the error analysis explains that DB is less sensitive to varying air pollution levels, diverse aerosol types, and different surface conditions, while the pattern of EDR is complicated. In addition, due to the common algorithmic heritage, both VIIRS EDR and MODIS DT products only show good matching over dark surfaces, while VIIRS DB and MODIS DB algorithms have good performance over both dark and bright surfaces. Finally, both EDR and DB products have shown significant downward AOD trends equal to −0.0008 per year (p < 0.01) in China during the last past six years, especially for three typical urban agglomerations. These evaluation results are expected to provide appropriate guidance for the application of VIIRS aerosol products in China.","","article","","250","","","VIIRS Environmental Data Record and Deep Blue aerosol products: validation, comparison, and spatiotemporal variations from 2013 to 2018 in China","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231021000832","1352-2310","2021","118265","Atmospheric Environment"

This broadband radiometer will aim to deliver near real-time estimates of the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes at high temporal resolution thanks to the geostationary orbit. To infer these fluxes, a radiance-to-flux conversion needs to be performed on measured radiances. Since we plan to carry out such a conversion by using the angular dependency models (ADMs) developed from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) experiment, the GERB ground segment will have to rely on some scene identification on SEVIRI data which mimic as close as possible the one from CERES in order to select the proper ADM.

However, optical remote sensing data often suffer from a large amount of missing information due to sensor failures and harsh atmospheric conditions. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers a new approach to filling in missing optical data based on its excessive revisit density and its potential to image without interference from clouds and rain. Due to the difference in imaging mechanisms between SAR and optical sensors, it is very difficult to fuse the data. This paper developed an advanced deep learning Spatio-temporal fusion method, i.e., Transformer Temporal-spatial Model (TTSM), to synergize the SAR and optical time-series to reconstruct vegetation NDVI time series in cloudy regions. The proposed multi-head attention and end-to-end architecture achieved satisfactory accuracy (R2 greater than 0.88), outperforming the existing deep learning solutions. Extensive experiments were carried out to evaluate the TTSM method on large-scale areas (the spatial scale of megapixels) in northeast China with the main vegetation types of crops and forests. The R2, SSIM, RMSE, NRMSE, and MAE of our prediction results were 0.88, 0.80, 0.06, 0.16, and 0.05, respectively.

It investigates the correlations between stranding, at-sea encounter rate and the fishing index for three common cetaceans: common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas). At the monthly scale, a seasonal stranding pattern significantly congruent with the at-sea encounter rate and the fishing index for D. delphis is revealed. At the inter-annual scale, stranding and at-sea encounter rates are shown to be correlated (p=0.013–0.044 according to species) and significantly increasing in abundance. Temporal variation in the ratio between individuals seen alive at sea and those stranded shows no significant trend suggesting that stranding is better explained by at-sea abundance than by the fishing index.

Particular interest has been paid to the monsoon response to Heinrich events, with variability explained by meridional shifts in positioning of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), but this model has not been adequately tested. In addition, the shorter-lived Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) events have not been detected (beyond D/O-1, the Bølling/Allerød) in land-based records from the Indo-Pacific, despite their prominent expression in stalagmites from southern Asia, raising questions about the sensitivity of the IASM to these events. Here we present a Southern Hemisphere stalagmite oxygen isotopic time series from Ball Gown Cave (BGC), tropical northern Australia, located on the margins of the modern austral summer ITCZ, that spans 40–31 and 27–8 ka. Elevated IASM rainfall coincides with Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas, while decreased rainfall characterizes D/O interstadials, a response that is anti-phased with sites spanning the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and with Chinese records of the East Asian summer monsoon. The BGC time series thus reveals a precipitation dipole consistent with a southward (northward) migration of the ITCZ during periods of high northern latitude cooling (warming) as the primary driver of millennial-scale IASM variability during the Last Glacial period. Our record indicates a strengthening of the IASM after the Younger Dryas period, likely as a result of rising sea level and sea surface temperatures, breaking the link with the high latitudes.","","article","","72","","","North Atlantic forcing of millennial-scale Indo-Australian monsoon dynamics during the Last Glacial period","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113001522","0277-3791","2013","159-168","Quaternary Science Reviews"

I report here on the accuracy and efficiency of this novel technology, compare it with two alternative methods, namely boat-based ultrasonic tracking and Argos Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs), and provide new data on the vagility and habitat selection of green turtles in shallow coastal foraging habitat. I used a combined FGPS receiver and PTT transmitter (Sirtrack, Havelock North, New Zealand) mounted together with an ultrasonic transmitter and time-depth recorder in a tether-attached housing that allowed automatic detachment and subsequent retrieval of the equipment without the requirement to recapture turtles. With this equipment I conducted short deployments (4.5 to 16.8 d) on 3 free-living adult-size green turtles in coastal foraging habitat in Queensland, Australia. In addition, stationary tests in air and afloat were conducted at the same site. FGPS location error (mean±SD) increased as the number of satellites used in each computation decreased, from 26 m±19.2 (8 satellites) to 172 m±317.5 (4 satellites). During live tracking the frequency of FGPS locations greatly exceeded Argos PTT, such that screened data comprised about 50 times more FGPS locations despite a much tighter screening threshold for FGPS (250 m) than for Argos PTT (1000 m). FGPS locations showed the three study turtles used modest short-term activity ranges with Minimum Convex Polygon area mean±SD 662 ha±293.9. They all remained within <4.7 km of their capture–release locations and favoured shallow water, with 86% of locations at charted depths ≤3 m and the deepest location at 5.9 m. Fine-scale movements of each turtle varied from day to day with respect to tortuosity and areas traversed. Statistically significant day–night differences were evident in average rates of movement (greater by day) and in habitat selection, where diurnal locations had greater seagrass density while nocturnal locations featured deeper bathymetry. Individual turtles revisited some of their centres of activity (identified from 50% fixed kernel utilisation distributions) on multiple occasions but none of the study turtles travelled consistently between the same day–night pair of sites as has been reported elsewhere. Such disparity and the day-to-day variation in movements revealed by these short-term findings highlight the need for detailed tracking over longer periods at multiple locations. Fastloc GPS technology proved an effective new tool for this area of research.","","article","","374","","","Evaluation of fast-acquisition GPS in stationary tests and fine-scale tracking of green turtles","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098109001397","0022-0981","2009","58-68","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology"

Due to anomalously high Ag concentrations in oysters from the estuary mouth, dissolved (AgD) and particulate Ag (AgP) concentrations in rivers of the Gironde Estuary watershed were studied. Using daily discharge, Suspended particulate matter (SPM) data and monthly measured AgD and AgP, the respective fluxes were estimated at the three main entries of the Gironde Estuary and at selected key sites at the outlets of different sub-watersheds for multiple years of the past decade. Dissolved and particulate Ag concentrations were 0.5ng/L (detection limit) to 5.7ng/L and 0.13–13.9mg/kg in all rivers, except for the Riou-Mort River (up to 1260ng/L and 261mg/kg) that has been heavily polluted by former Zn ore treatment and remaining waste tailings. At all sites Ag transport mainly (73–100%) occurred in the particulate phase, i.e. strongly depended on hydrological parameters. Comparing Th-normalised (i.e. grain size independent) AgP levels at the different sites including one remote site showed that the regional background is best described by AgP/ThP=0.026. The anthropogenic components in AgP levels and fluxes ranged from 24% to 90% at all sites, except for the Riou-Mort River (81–99%). Although this former ore treatment site still is an evident Ag source to the Lot-Garonne fluvial–estuarine system, its contribution to Ag fluxes at the main entry of the Gironde Estuary (i.e. 0.33–2.44t/a at the La Reole site) is <11%. This clearly suggests that other sources such as rock weathering and erosion (0.057–0.817t/a), urban wastewater inputs (0.042–0.057t/a) and cloud-seeding (0.030–0.063t/a) contribute the major parts of the fluvial Ag budget in this watershed. The estimated anthropogenic surface- and population-specific Ag fluxes in the studied system were 1.14–682g/km2/a and 0.028–6.05g/person/a, respectively. The results obtained suggest that the Gironde fluvial–estuarine system is contaminated by Ag inputs from various sources, but further work is necessary to (i) identify and quantify the major sources and (ii) produce comparable data for other systems, which would be useful for the evaluation of Ag contamination at a larger scale.","","article","","26","","","Silver fluxes to the Gironde Estuary – Eleven years (1999–2009) of monitoring at the watershed scale","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292711000552","0883-2927","2011","797-808","Applied Geochemistry"

Based on three HW-definitions and five aspects for each definition some 15 indices were calculated and analyzed for the extended summer period (November-March). The three definitions of the HWs employed in this study were based on: (1) the TX exceeding the 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days, (2) the TN exceeding the 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days, and (3) the positive values of excess heat factor (EHF) maintaining for at least three consecutive days. The five aspects calculated for each of the definitions provided information related to the frequency, duration, and intensity of HWs. Trends (be them increasing or decreasing), magnitude (change per decade) and statistical significance (p < 0.05) were identified using the ordinary least square method and the t-test. Therefore, in terms of HW aspects, the results of the HWs climate regime analysis showed that the most extreme region of Chile is the Atacama Desert, followed by the Santiago metropolitan area. Change analysis revealed that Chile experienced increasing trends in most of the HW data sets. Thus, the frequency of trend types of all HW indices time series showed an increasing trend of 79%. About 24% of the time series showed statistically significant increasing trends. Decreasing trends were found in about 20% of the analyzed data, less than 1% of which being statistically significant. Stationary trends were detected in only 2% of the series. The highest frequency of statistically significant increasing trends was found in the HWs identified based on TX, followed by those computed based on EHF. Regarding their aspects, the number of events had the highest frequency of significant increasing trends. In terms of spatial distribution, the most important changes were found in central Chile.","","article","","169","","","Changes in heat waves in Chile","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818117305362","0921-8181","2018","234-246","Global and Planetary Change"

Although preliminary results of Sargassum distributions in the nearby oceans have been obtained using measurements from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), MERIS stopped functioning in 2012, and detecting and quantifying Sargassum distributions still face technical challenges due to ambiguous pixels from clouds, cloud shadows, cloud adjacency effect, and large-scale image gradient. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to detect Sargassum presence and to quantify Sargassum coverage using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) alternative floating algae index (AFAI), which examines the red-edge reflectance of floating vegetation. This approach includes three basic steps: 1) classification of Sargassum-containing pixels through correction of large-scale gradient, masking clouds and cloud shadows, and removal of ambiguous pixels; 2) linear unmixing of Sargassum-containing pixels; and, 3) statistics of Sargassum area coverage in pre-defined grids at monthly, seasonal, and annual intervals. In the absence of direct field measurements to validate the results, limited observations from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) measurements and numerous local reports support the conclusion that the elevated AFAI signals are due to the presence of Sargassum instead of other floating materials, and various sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the uncertainties in the derived Sargassum area coverage. The approach was applied to MODIS observations between 2000 and 2015 over the Central West Atlantic (CWA) region (0–22°N, 63–38°W) to derive the spatial and temporal distribution patterns as well as the total area coverage of Sargassum. Results indicate that the first widespread Sargassum distribution event occurred in 2011, consistent with previous MERIS findings. Since 2011, only 2013 showed a minimal Sargassum coverage similar to the period of 2000 to 2010; all other years showed significantly more coverage. More alarmingly, the summer months of 2015 showed mean coverage of >2000km2, or about 4 times of the summer 2011 coverage and 20 times of the summer 2000 to 2010 coverage. Analysis of several environmental variables provided some hints on the reasons causing the inter-annual changes after 2010, yet further multi-disciplinary research (including in situ measurements) is required to understand such changes and long-term trends in Sargassum coverage.","","article","","183","","","Mapping and quantifying Sargassum distribution and coverage in the Central West Atlantic using MODIS observations","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425716301833","0034-4257","2016","350-367","Remote Sensing of Environment"

Underway measurements of sea surface CO2 fugacity (fCO2sw), sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) compiled during the cruises were analysed and integrated into a single database which provided the resolution/sensitivity required for an examination of the seasonal variability of the fCO2sw; these data allowed the reconstruction of the climatological seasonal cycle for the year 2005. The seasonal cycle of both SST and SSS was found to be within the range of the thermohaline signature of the North Atlantic Surface Water, which is the main water mass that flows into the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar at the surface. The seasonal distribution of fCO22005 was characterised by a monthly minimum value of 334±12μatm in May, followed by a gradual increase to a maximum of 385μatm during late summer, due to the warming of surface waters. The spatial variability of fCO2sw observed in the area also indicated that superimposed phenomena, occurring at scales other than seasonal, could affect the dissolved CO2 distribution. In particular, intense vertical mixing processes generated by internal waves in this region may have an impact on the surface fCO2sw on a tidal scale. Seasonal CO2 cycle dynamics indicated that the surface waters of the Strait of Gibraltar acted as an atmospheric CO2 source during summer and autumn and a CO2 sink during winter and spring. When these sink/source strengths are integrated on an annual basis, the Strait of Gibraltar was close to equilibrium with atmospheric CO2, resulting in a neutral atmosphere-ocean exchange (−0.06±0.12molC m−2 yr−1).","","article","","126","","","Reconstruction of the seasonal cycle of air–sea CO2 fluxes in the Strait of Gibraltar","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420311000582","0304-4203","2011","155-162","Marine Chemistry"

However, little is known about the factors that have influenced past monsoon activity in southern Indonesia. Here, we present a ∼6000 years high-resolution record of Australian-Indonesian summer monsoon (AISM) rainfall variations based on bulk sediment element analysis in a sediment archive retrieved offshore northwest Sumba Island (Indonesia). The record suggests lower riverine detrital supply and hence weaker AISM rainfall between 6000 yr BP and ∼3000 yr BP compared to the Late Holocene. We find a distinct shift in terrigenous sediment supply at around 2800 yr BP indicating a reorganization of the AISM from a drier Mid Holocene to a wetter Late Holocene in southern Indonesia. The abrupt increase in rainfall at around 2800 yr BP coincides with a grand solar minimum. An increase in southern Indonesian rainfall in response to a solar minimum is consistent with climate model simulations that provide a possible explanation of the underlying mechanism responsible for the monsoonal shift. We conclude that variations in solar activity play a significant role in monsoonal rainfall variability at multi-decadal and longer timescales. The combined effect of orbital and solar forcing explains important details in the temporal evolution of AISM rainfall during the last 6000 years. By contrast, we find neither evidence for volcanic forcing of AISM variability nor for a control by long-term variations in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).","","article","","93","","","Mid- to Late-Holocene Australian–Indonesian summer monsoon variability","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027737911400122X","0277-3791","2014","142-154","Quaternary Science Reviews"

LCOP varied from $622/tls to $722/tls for the different plant configurations. Procuring electricity from the day-ahead electricity markets could reduce the LCOP by 15%. Increasing the electrolyzer capacity reduced the operational costs, but increased the capital investments, reducing the overall advantage. Sensitivity analysis revealed that electricity price and iron ore price are the major contributors to uncertainty for configurations with fixed electricity prices. For configurations with higher electrolyzer capacity, changes in the iron ore price and parameters related to capital investment were found to affect the LCOP significantly.","","article","","350","","","Decarbonizing primary steel production : Techno-economic assessment of a hydrogen based green steel production plant in Norway","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622009659","0959-6526","2022","131339","Journal of Cleaner Production"

For the first time, general unified conclusions can be made, providing CO2 thresholds where effects on plants and soil microbiology are observed and making recommendations on how this information can be used when planning projects for CO2 storage. The sites include those where CO2 is being naturally released to the atmosphere from deep geological formations; and a non-adapted site, with no previous history of CO2 seepage, where CO2 has been injected into the unsaturated soil horizon. Whilst soil gas concentrations will be influenced by flux rates and other factors, the results suggest that a concentration of between 10% and 15% CO2 soil gas at 20cm depth, which is within the root zone, is an important threshold level for observing changes in plant coverage. Site-specific plant ‘indicators’ are also observed for CO2 concentrations at ≥35%. Microbiological changes are seen where CO2 soil gas concentrations are between 15% and 40%. As part of site characterisation, an evaluation of the risks of leakage and their potential environmental impacts should be undertaken.","","article","","42","","","Comparison of the impacts of elevated CO2 soil gas concentrations on selected European terrestrial environments","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583615300281","1750-5836","2015","357-371","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control"

InISAR applies interferometric technology of multi antenna to inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR). It can realize 3D imaging of long distance non-cooperative targets, under all weather conditions. Hence it has wide range of applications, especially in military and civilian applications. In InISAR imaging, interferometric processing is applied to the two obtained ISAR images of each baseline, achieving the projection coordinates of the scattering centers along the baseline direction, which are denoted as x and y coordinates in this paper. Then, the 3D imaging result is established combined with the radial information, which is denoted as z coordinate in this paper. The InISAR 3D image is directly consistent with the physical size of the target. It can reflect the constant feature that is not affected by the target motion characteristics, effectively improving the target recognition ability. On the basis of the basic principle of InlSAR 3D imaging, this paper reviews and summarizes the development and research status of InISAR 3D imaging, focuses on the technical difficulties and main solutions, and points out the direction of further research in view of the existing problems.","","article","","153","","","Review on interferometric ISAR 3D imaging: Concept, technology and experiment","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168418302470","0165-1684","2018","164-187","Signal Processing"

We present a guidance framework for the selection and evaluation of indicators for assessment of ecosystem status, trends monitoring and reporting and apply it to the Scotian Shelf Bioregion, Nova Scotia, Canada. In particular, we focus on the selection of a parsimonious suite of complementary indicators using clear criteria and hierarchical cluster analysis to reduce redundancy in the indicator suite. In applying the framework to the Scotian Shelf Bioregion we separate the region into a range of spatial scales for indicator estimation to determine the impact of spatial aggregation on indicator redundancy. Overall results suggest patterns of redundancy among indicators were generally consistent at all spatial scales. Differences in indicator trends for eastern and western Scotian Shelf were observed, reflecting their different environmental properties and fishing histories. In a few cases, spatial differences in indicators trends were large enough to remove these indicators from a cluster representing all spatial scales. We recommend that the Redundancy Analysis should be repeated every 5–10 years to ensure that the clusters are still strong and that the indicator selected to represent the cluster is still optimal. Overall, the assessment of the Scotian Shelf Bioregion highlighted large coherent trends across indicators and attributes at all spatial scales indicating that this system has undergone massive, negative change since 1970. Despite reductions in fishing pressure in many fisheries through resource management actions, most attributes have not improved in recent years. This Framework represents a general approach that can be extended to additional system goals, attributes and indicators and is widely applicable across data rich and data poor systems.","","article","","104","","","Scrupulous proxies: Defining and applying a rigorous framework for the selection and evaluation of a suite of ecological indicators","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X19300524","1470-160X","2019","737-754","Ecological Indicators"

Here, we provide a review of different types of seasonality preserved by stalagmites and methods for extracting this information. A new drip classification scheme is introduced, which facilitates the identification of stalagmites fed by seasonally responsive drips and which highlights the wide variability in drip types feeding stalagmites. This hydrological variability, combined with seasonality in Earth atmospheric processes, meteoric precipitation, biological processes within the soil, and cave atmosphere composition means that every stalagmite retains a different and distinct (but correct) record of environmental conditions. Replication of a record is extremely useful but should not be expected unless comparing stalagmites affected by the same processes in the same proportion. A short overview of common microanalytical techniques is presented, and suggested best practice discussed. In addition to geochemical methods, a new modelling technique for extracting meteoric precipitation and temperature palaeoseasonality from stalagmite δ18O data is discussed and tested with both synthetic and real-world datasets. Finally, world maps of temperature, meteoric precipitation amount, and meteoric precipitation oxygen isotope ratio seasonality are presented and discussed, with an aim of helping to identify regions most sensitive to shifts in seasonality.","","article","","254","","","Detecting and quantifying palaeoseasonality in stalagmites using geochemical and modelling approaches","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379120307460","0277-3791","2021","106784","Quaternary Science Reviews"

Research shows that the combined business models (products combined with services) have a positive effect on the business. Likewise, it is profitable to think strategically and in long term for enterprises offering maintenance services, especially using performance-based models. But for achieving these benefits the view of the business has to change. The focus should be on the values created and not in the offers in form of products or services. Moreover, the company needs to position itself as an actor not only in the value chain, but in a wider context referred to as the business ecosystem. Making such a shift of focus is hard though, and there is a need to understand both the current state of the business as well as the potential future directions. The framework presented in this paper is an attempt to meet these needs. The framework describes business model development in four levels. From maturity point of view, the four steps could be seen as the logical development of the business model from a narrow technical perspective to a holistic product-service perspective. The four levels could also be connected to the industrial development where level four supports Industry 4.0. Level four is referred to as Service Management 4.0. In particular, four key concepts reflect the concept of Service Management 4.0: the mix of products and services in customer offers, performance-based contracts, partnering and the business ecology concept.","","article","","47","","","Business Model Development Towards Service Management 4.0","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221282711630453X","2212-8271","2016","489-494","Procedia CIRP"

Measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite from 2002 to 2010 and surface atmosphere temperature (SAT) data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are used to study and quantify the extreme sea ice event in the 2009–2010 winter and the interannual variability of the regional sea ice properties, as well as the relationship between sea ice and the climate variability in the Bohai Sea. The mean sea ice reflectance from MODIS-Aqua visible and near-infrared wavelengths are 9.33%, 13.26%, and 12.60% in the months of December 2009, January 2010, and February 2010, respectively, compared with the monthly average sea ice reflectance values (from 2002 to 2010) of 9.35%, 11.21%, and 11.41% in the same three winter months.

The LDA analyzes the literature inventory by extracting 50 distinguishable wordclouds, each centered around one distinct research theme and assigned a unique topic name. Subsequently, various measures have been proposed to integrate the posterior distributions of these research topics with article information such as publication year, journal name, and correspondence address. The increase index identifies five cold and hot topics, which reflect the shift of research interests in the community. Emerging research topics such as seismic risk assessment and composite material have received much more attention in recent years. Moreover, advanced metrics have been proposed to analyze the research similarity and evolution across different journals and countries/regions. As discussed in the paper, analysis findings would enable community stakeholders (e.g., students, engineers, researchers, conference organizers, journal editors, funding agencies) to explore the state of the research and develop viable strategies to further foster the healthy growth of the community.

This characterization is based on the available geological and geophysical information and on the correlation of the southern end of the best-known Santa Lucía Basin in Uruguay to the Salado Basin in Argentina, and their connection through the Quilmes Trough. Furthermore, a new Meso-Cenozoic depocenter is characterized and identified as Recalada Trough, subparallely aligned to the Quilmes Trough and separated from it by the Magdalena-Montevideo High. Both sedimentary fillings present ENE-WSW trending main axes and reach an average thickness of almost 2000 m. This suggests an evolution from a triple junction where interconnected extensional arms developed, which have had common Mesozoic tectosedimentary histories related to the early opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Based on the geophysical and geological evidence, the previously accepted existence in the Río de la Plata of a first-order structural feature along the international border between Argentina and Uruguay, associated to an ENE-WSW trending tectonic high, identified as Martín García, is unjustified. The tectonic evolution of the Atlantic margin in front of the Río de la Plata estuary is the consequence of a long deformation history starting in the Precambrian up to recent times. Each Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic scenario adds different weak trends on the continental crust, which control the evolution of the sedimentary depocenters. The presence of these tectosedimentary records influence the bathymetric control of the Río de la Plata and the dynamics of the recent estuarine deposits. The Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary infill is estimated to comprise considerable ranges of sandstones and conglomerates associated with faulted blocks of the crystalline basement, with expected petrophysical conditions oscillating in the order of 12%–15% of effective porosity and with expected traps of the stratigraphic and combined (closing against faulting) type, and overlapped by fine sediments with excellent quality as seals. The economic significance of these sedimentary volumes lies in their yet unexplored potential as natural fluid reservoirs (hydrocarbons and groundwater), of great importance due to their strategic position near the large urban areas of Buenos Aires and Montevideo.","","article","","83","","","Geology of the Río de la Plata and the surrounding areas of Argentina and Uruguay related to the evolution of the Atlantic margin","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981117304017","0895-9811","2018","147-164","Journal of South American Earth Sciences"

With the extensive data set now available for the state, the linear relation of heat flow and heat production appears as a very useful generalization for the study of the heat flow field of a geological province. Our measurements indicate that the vertical distribution of radiogenic heat production is similar in plutonic and metasedimentary rocks. Our data are compatible with the linear relationship established earlier by F. Birch and his co-workers in 1968. Young granites are markedly enriched in radioactive elements and those which do not outcrop are revealed by anomalies in the general relation of heat flow versus radioactivity. Heat flow is high for plutons by low elsewhere. The mean heat flow through metasedimentary formations is 1.15 μcal/cm2 s (48 mW/m2), a value near the mean heat flow for old cratons. The lowest heat flow measured is 0.76 μcal/cm2 s (32 mW/m2) for a unit poor in radioactivity. The heat flow field grades smoothly into the low heat flow regions of the Canadian Shield. The New Hampshire region is in thermal equilibrium: its heat flow is in secular equilibrium with the heat generated by crustal sources and that supplied from the mantle. In this area, the thermal perturbations due to orogenic events decrease below the detection level in less than 200–275 Ma.

A formation control system based on intermittent broadcast, rather than the traditional distributed control system, is established based on a leader-follower strategy. During the process of formation moving, the input constraints, vehicle collision avoidance and input saturation needed to be noted. To this end, the model predictive control algorithm is employed to design the formation controller, and the stability of the formation control system is proved by the average residence time notion and Lyapunov stability.

Sedimentation rate between 2006 and 2007 was above the threshold at which S. japonica can germinate. After the loss of an 11-ha S. japonica patch from the eastern part of Donggum-do, sedimentation was accelerated because of a decrease in tidal current caused by a series of land reclamation projects. The increased monthly exposure duration due to continuous sediment accretion altered the type of salt marsh.

Maximum annual grain size depends most strongly on maximum spring daily discharge (r2=0.63, n=43, p<0.0001) and maximum annual daily discharge (r2=0.61, n=43, p<0.0001), while varve thickness is poorly correlated with maximum annual grain size (r2=0.004, n=287, p=0.33). Relations between varve thickness and annual climate variables (temperature, precipitation, North Pacific (NP) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices) are insignificant.

Periods with increased varve thickness and total annual discharge were associated with warm PDO phases and a strengthened Aleutian Low.

The effectiveness is quantified by two measures, i.e., monotonicity and trendability. Among those features, the area under SK is utilized for the first time as a condition indicator of rolling bearing fault.

No infectious agents associated with cell pathology were detected microscopically. Bleaching and overgrowth by algae and sponges, as well as unexplained tissue loss, are common in Pocillopora. These lesions and anatomical changes warrant further study since their incidence is potentially indicative of reef degradation.","","article","","120","","","Gross and microscopic pathology of lesions in Pocillopora spp. from the subtropical eastern Pacific","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022201114000639","0022-2011","2014","9-17","Journal of Invertebrate Pathology"

These changes, in their importance, scope, and complexity, is different than what humanity has known until now. We do not yet know what will happen, but one thing is certain: our response must be comprehensive and it must involve all stakeholders at the global level: the public sector, the private sector, the academic world and civil society. Applications for the industrial sector are already numerous: predictive maintenance, improved decision-making in real time, anticipation of stocks according to the progress of production, etc. So many improvements that optimize the production tools every day a little more, and point to possibilities for the future of Industry 4.0, the crossroads of an interconnected global world. This work comes to contribute as a part of this industrial evolution(Usine 4.0). In this paper we introduce a part of a collaboration between industry and research area in order to develop a DT and AR industrial solution as a part of a predictive maintenance framework. In this context, we elaborate a proof-of-concept that was developed in special industrial application.","","article","","17","","","Towards improving the future of manufacturing through digital twin and augmented reality technologies","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978918311867","2351-9789","2018","460-467","Procedia Manufacturing"

Liberato","","","","Explosive cyclogenesis, Atmospheric river, Windstorm, Iberia, Wind and precipitation extremes, Natural hazards","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2014.06.002","On 19 January 2013 Portugal was once again on an extreme meteorological risk warning state due to the landfall of a rapidly deepening low pressure system exactly on the period of its maximum explosive development. This storm, named Gong, had a central minimum pressure of 968hPa, observed wind gusts of 140kmh−1 on some locations of the Portuguese coast and was responsible for the downfall of thousands of trees on some of the Portuguese national forests, the destruction of several hundred farms among other huge socioeconomic losses and fatalities. The large-scale synoptic conditions and dynamical characteristics of windstorm Gong, as well as the associated meteorological and socioeconomic adverse impacts are reviewed in this paper. For this purpose an objective lagrangean method, which identifies and follows individual lows, is applied for the assessment of the cyclone track and lifetime characteristics, which is complemented by the analysis of several thermohydrodynamical reanalysis fields during the lifetime of the cyclone. Results show that Gong underwent an explosive development with ‘bomb’ characteristics between the Azores and the Iberian Peninsula, with a deepening rate unusually high for these latitudes. The rapid deepening of Gong was supported by the southerly displacement of the polar jet stream; by a pronounced cyclonic potential vorticity streamer which approached Iberia from northwest; and by the presence of an atmospheric river over the western and central subtropical North Atlantic converging into Gong׳s genesis region and then crossing the Atlantic basin, moving along with the storm towards Iberia. Understanding the dynamics of these high impact extreme events may be of relevance in view of improving extreme forecasts as well as of public awareness, policy making and risk assessment and management of severe weather in Portugal.","","article","","5-6","","","The 19 January 2013 windstorm over the North Atlantic: large-scale dynamics and impacts on Iberia","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094714000620","2212-0947","2014","16-28","Weather and Climate Extremes"

Especially in the context of changing hydrological environment, more attention need to be paid on how to use limited water resource to improve crop yield for ensuring food security. Based on 33 site-years of flux measurements over 10 cropland sites using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, the study systematically evaluated the large differences in seasonal and interannual variations of gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and ecosystem WUE across the four crops worldwide including soybean, maize, winter wheat and paddy rice. The lengths of the growing seasons across the main crops extracted from time-series MODIS NDVI data, implied that the longest growth period in winter wheat and the shortest growing season in paddy rice field. Further analyses suggest that maize cropland has the strongest ecosystem WUE with 2.48 ± 0.69 g C kg−1 H2O, followed by winter wheat (2.00 ± 0.39 g C kg−1 H2O), soybean (1.92 ± 0.52 g C kg−1 H2O), and paddy rice (1.88 ± 0.63 g C kg−1 H2O). Meanwhile, the variability in ecosystem WUE exhibited apparent seasonality, and peaked together with GPP in the most active summertime. A series of biotic and abiotic factors affected the GPP as well as WUE variability. Given the complicated interactions among these environmental factors, this study revealed the great potential to remotely retrieve the WUE variability using time-series MODIS NDVI data over large areas. Ecosystem WUE of the C4 crop –maize was obviously higher than the other three C3 crops. Engineering C4 feature into C3 crops may be a feasible way to increase photosynthesis and yield.","","article","","209","","","Differences in ecosystem water-use efficiency among the typical croplands","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377418306553","0378-3774","2018","142-150","Agricultural Water Management"

This work provides scientific basis for future studies on environmental research and fills the gap in knowledge on the worldwide continental platforms. Metal distributions identified three different zones, mainly influenced by industrial and urban sewer (northern areas), agriculture runoffs (central zone), and estuarine discharges (southern areas), respectively. In the north part of the shelf, metal enrichments are observed near industrial and urban sewer mouths (Casablanca and Mohammedia cities). In the south and central areas, the probable absence of human impact on sediments is attributed to effective trapping in the estuary (Oum Er Rbia) and coastal zones, as well as dilution with less contaminated sediments and shelf sediments and removal with fine fractions due to estuary discharges.","","article","","511","","","Environmental risk assessment of the Moroccan Atlantic continental shelf: The role of the industrial and urban area","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714018099","0048-9697","2015","407-415","Science of The Total Environment"
